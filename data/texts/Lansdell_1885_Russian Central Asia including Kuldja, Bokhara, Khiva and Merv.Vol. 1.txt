This  is  a  digital  copy  of  a  book  that  was  preserved  for  generations  on  library  shelves  before  it  was  carefully  scanned  by  Google  as  part  of  a  project 

to  make  the  world's  books  discoverable  online. 

It  has  survived  long  enough  for  the  copyright  to  expire  and  the  book  to  enter  the  public  domain.  A  public  domain  book  is  one  that  was  never  subject 

to  copyright  or  whose  legal  copyright  term  has  expired.  Whether  a  book  is  in  the  public  domain  may  vary  country  to  country.  Public  domain  books 

are  our  gateways  to  the  past,  representing  a  wealth  of  history,  culture  and  knowledge  that's  often  difficult  to  discover.

EMPEROR  AND  AUTOCRAT  OF  ALL  THE  RUSSIAS,

Sire, 

/  count  myself  happy  in  being  permitted  to  dedicate 
this  work  to  the  august  Ruler  of  an  Empire  in  which  I  have 
travelled  extensively,  and  from  whose  people  I  have  met  with 
unvarying  kindness,  and  attention.  Most  of  my  visits  to  the 
Continent  were  undertaken  with  a  view  to  relaxation  and  enjoy- 
mentf  but  with  this  has  been  blended  an  attempt  to  be  of 
religious  use  to  the  poor  and  unfortunate. 

I  was  considering  how  such  a  double  purpose  could  be  effected 
in  seven  countries  through  which  I  was  to  pass,  in  1874, 
when,  not  knowing  the  language  of  Russia,  my  only  course  for 
that  country  seemed  to  be  the  distribution  of  religious  literature. 
This  distribution  I  was  allowed  to  begin  in  the  prisons  of 
Petersburg;  and  during  five  subsequent  summers  I  have  pur- 
sued a  similar  method  over  the  greater  portion  of  the  Empire. 

On  each  of  these  occasions  I  sought  the  assistance  of  two 
Societies  in  London,  by  whose  aid  I  was  enabled  to  distribute 
more  than  100,000  publications,  and  to  place  at  least  some 
portion  of  Holy  Scripture  in  each  room  oj  every  prison  and 
hospital  throughout  Finland,  the  Caucasus,  and  certain  othet 
parts  of  European  Russia,  as  well  as  throughout  the  whole 
of  Siberia,  the  works  circulated  being  either  printed  by  the  Holy 
Synod,  or  duly  authorized  by  the  Censor.

iv  DEDICATION. 

I  take  pleasure  in  saying  that  these  efforts  have  been 
uniformly  well  received^  alike  by  your  Imperial  Majesty's 
Officials t  the  Clergy,  and  the  people;  and  I  trust  they  have 
also  your  Majesty s  approval  and  sympathy,  I  cannot  doubt 
that  the  good^-wiU  thus  manifested  towards  the  endeavours  of 
a  foreigner,  is  in  part  the  outcome  of  thai  encouragement 
to  the  distribution  of  the  Holy  Scriptures  which  has  been 
shown  for  many  years  by  your  Imperial  Majesty^ s  illustrious 
predecessors;  and  I  venture  very  humbly  to  express  the  hope 
that  what  little  I  have  been  permitted  to  do  in  the  hospitals 
and  prisons  of  the  vast  realms  of  Russia  may  be  continued 
and  multiplied  a  hundredfold  by  your  Imperial  Majesty  and 
your  faithful  subjects. 

If  I  may  add  but  one  wordy  it  shall  be  to  express  my 
grateful  appreciation  of  the  confidence  reposed  in  me,  when 
unrestricted  permission  was  given  for  the  dedication  of  this 
book  to  your  Imperial  Majesty,  Conformably  therewith  I  have 
treated  my  subject  frankly  and  without  reserve  (in  fact,  I  had 
all  butfnished  the  work  before  the  welcome  permission  arrived)  ; 
and  though  I  dare  not  anticipate  that  no  mistakes  will  be  found, 
yet  I  am  hopeful  that  these  pages  will  show  that  I  have  striven 
to  write  impartially,  and  prove  likewise  that  your  Majesty s 
confidence  has  not  been  misplaced. 

It  is  with  these  sentiments.  Sire,  I  desire  to  inscribe  my 
volumes,  I  pray  that  He  who  alone  can  bestow  every  good  gift 
may  vouchsafe  to  your  Imperial  Majesty  a  long  continuance 
of  health  and  happiness,  and 

I  have  the  honour  to  remain 
Your  Imperial  Majesty s  very  humble  Servant, 

THE  AUTHOR. 


PREFACE. 


THESE  volumes  may  be  considered  as  a  record 
of  the  completion  of  the  philanthropic  object 
that  originally  prompted  my  first  visit  to  Asiatic 
Russia  as  detailed  in  the  work  entitled  **  Through 
Siberia."  My  sources  of  information  have  been 
four  :  namely,  personal  observations,  carefully  noted 
on  the  spot ;  a  series  of  conversations  on  a  pre- 
arranged plan  with  inhabitants  of  Central  Asia ; 
official  statistics  and  unpublished  documents ;  and, 
lastly,  the  general  literature  of  the  subject. 

Not  many  Englishmen  have  preceded  me  in 
Turkistan,  and  not  one,  so  far  as  I  know,  over  the  last 
portion  of  my  journey.  The  only  English  writer 
who  has  covered  the  major  part  of  the  route  is 
Dr.  Eugene  Schuyler,  of  whose  **  Turkistan "  I  can 
speak  in  terms  only  of  the  highest  praise.  He  has 
treated  many  subjects  so  fully  that  I  have  thought 
it  unnecessary  to  say  much  about  them.  This  is 
notably  the  case  with  commerce  and  methods  of 
war ;  and  I  have  regarded  politics  also  as  not  falling 
within  my  province.  The  work  of  M.  Ujfalvy  de 
Mezo-Kovesd    I    have   found   quite   the  best  on  the 


vi  PREFA  CE. 

anthropology  of  Turkistan,  whilst  in  historical  matters 
I  have  been  frequently  indebted  to  the  **  History  of 
the  Mongols "  by  Mr.  Howorth,  who,  as  on  a  pre- 
vious occasion,  has  given  some  of  my  proof-sheets  the 
benefit  of  his  revision. 

I  have  preferred,  however,  when  possible,  to 
gather  my  materials  direct  from  Russian  authorities, 
and  have  been  able  to  do  so  largely,  thanks  to  help 
in  translation  afforded  by  Messrs.  Robert  Michell 
and  W.  H.  Cromie,  and  by  Mesdames  Telfer,  Bell, 
and  Romanoff.  From  one  Russian  author.  Colonel 
Kostenko,  I  have  gathered  much  statistical  infor- 
mation, and  with  what  labour  the  literature  of  the 
subject  has  been  examined,  the  preface  to  my 
Bibliography  will  show.  I  need  only  say  here  that, 
when  the  name  of  an  authority  is  mentioned,  if 
the  reader  wishes  for  further  information,  he  will  be 
directed  thereto  by  turning  to  the  alphabetical  list 
of  authors. 

The  knowledge  thus  acquired  I  have  arranged 
with  a  view  to  the  requirements  of  three  classes 
of  readers.  The  **  general "  reader  may  probably 
not  care  to  wade  through  the  notes,  nor,  indeed,  to 
read  all  the  chapters.  Perhaps,  therefore,  it  may 
be  of  use  to  point  out  that  the  narrative  portions 
of  the  journey,  especially  in  the  first  volume,  will 
be  found  in  the  chapters  with  titles  indicative  of 
movement — **From  Such-a-place  to  Such-a-place"; 
or,  as  indicated  more  minutely,  in  the  **  Author's 
Itinerary." 


PREFACE.  vii 

Readers  of  the  second  class  have  been  regarded  as 
students,  who  like  to  know  something  of  the  country 
traversed,  its  geography,  geology,  fauna  and  flora, 
the  characteristics  of  the  people,  their  govern- 
ment, language,  and  religion.  These  and  similar 
topics  are  touched  upon  in  the  notes,  and  whole 
chapters  also  are  devoted  to  the  political  economy  of 
certain  provinces,  to  ethnography,  and  to  historical 
sketches  of  the  Khanates  and  their  conquest  by 
Russia. 

There  is  yet  a  third  class  of  readers — men  of 
science  and  specialists  —  for  whom  I  have  en- 
deavoured to  furnish  information.  I  would  willingly 
have  seen  this  department  in  more  competent  hands ; 
but  since  the  greater  part  of  what  is  known  con- 
cerning the  fauna  and  flora  of  Turkistan  is  inaccessible 
to  the  major  part  of  the  scientific  world,  because 
written  in  Russian,  I  have  added  appendices,  which 
have  been  most  kindly  revised  by  eminent  naturalists, 
both  on  the  Continent  and  in  England.  To  the 
former  I  have  expressed  my  indebtedness  further  on, 
whilst  among  the  latter  my  best  thanks  are  due  to 
Professor  Newton,  F.R.S.,  and  Dr.  Giinther,  F.R.S., 
for  help  in  treating  of  vertebrate  animals, — Mr. 
Dresser,  F.Z.S.,  also  revising  the  list  of  birds. 
Entomology  has  been  undertaken  by  Messrs.  Mac- 
Lachlan,  F.R.S.,  and  W.  F.-  Kirby.  In  botany  I 
have  received  aid  from  the  Rev.  W.  W.  Tyler;  and,  in 
matters  geological,  from  Professor  Bonney,  F.R.S., 
and    Dr.    Haughton,    F.R.S.       My    neighbour,    Mr. 


viii  PREFA  CE. 

Glaisher,  F.R.S.,  has  again  assisted  me  in  meteoro- 
logy; and  I  am  gratified  that  a  few  chapters  have 
passed  under  the  eye  of  that  eminent  geographer 
of  Central  Asia,  Colonel  Yule,  C.B.  In  mentioning 
these  distinguished  names,  however,  I  wish  it  to  be 
understood  that  their  revision  has  been  in  many 
cases  of  a  general  character  only,  and  consequently 
that  for  any  mistakes  that  may  remain,  it  is  I  who 
am  responsible,  and  not  they. 

Turkistan  has  not  many  prisons,  but  in  the  chapters 
devoted  to  this  subject  I  have  given  an  accurate 
account  of  what  caqie  under  my  observation;  and  I 
have  also  answered  the  few  objections,  that  were 
raised  to  my  former  account  of  the  penal  institutions 
of  Siberia  so  far  as  they  seemed  to  claim  attention. 

Biblical  students  will  observe  references  throughout 
the  work  to  Scripture  texts.  Their  origin  was  on 
this  wise.  Before  commencing  my  desert  journey, 
I  had  read  all  the  books  in  my  trunk,  and  it 
occurred  to  me  to  utilize  vacant  time  by  marking 
in  a  pocket  Bible  the  passages  that  might  be 
illustrated  from  my  travels.  I  remembered  that 
Robert  Stephens  is  said  to  have  divided  the  New 
Testament  into  verses  during  a  journey  on  horse- 
back from  Paris  to  Lyons  ;  so  I  took  a  leaf  from 
his  book,  while  on  the  back  of  a  camel.  In  the 
case  of  some  of  the  texts  referred  to,  my  remarks 
may  at  first  sight  seem  superfluous,  because  the 
Semitic  customs  of  Palestine  and  Western  Asia  have 
long   ago   been   illustrated   in  connection    with    Bible 


PREFA  CE,  ix 

history.  I  would  remind  the  reader,  however,  that 
I  travelled  as  far  from  Palestine  on  the  east  as 
London  is  on  the  west ;  and  among  an  Iranian  popu- 
lation, many  of  whose  customs  are  those  portrayed 
in  the  Sacred  Books,  especially  those  written  during 
the  Captivity.  In  China  we  have  an  instance  of 
a  colony  of  Jews  losing  their  religion  and  language, 
and,  in  the  course  of  centuries,  becoming  so  in- 
termingled with  their  neighbours  as  to  be  undis- 
tinguishable,  I  believe,  even  by  their  physiognomy. 
Now,  I  do  not  maintain  that  a  similar  fate  has 
befallen  the  **lost  ten  tribes'*  in  Central  Asia;  never- 
theless, I  found  Bible  customs  there,  which,  if  not 
traced  to  some  remote  origin  common  also  to  those 
of  the  Jews,  might  well  be  imagined  as  brought 
there  by  children  of  Abraham.  No  previous  traveller 
known  to  me  has  illustrated  Scripture  fi:om  these 
little-known  regions ;  and  if  I  sometimes  appear  to 
be  over-keen  in  suggesting  resemblances,  it  is  because 
I  have  regarded  them,  so  far  as  they  are  true,  as 
testimony  y^w  a  new  source. 

These  references  have  been  looked  over  by  the 
Rev.  Canon  R.  Girdlestone.  This  addition,  however, 
to  the  foregoing  names  does  not  exhaust  my  list  of 
helpers.  Mr.  Hyde  Clarke,  F.S.S.,  has  given  me 
literary  assistance,  and  so  has  the  Rev.  A.  E. 
Hodgson,  B.A.,  as  well  as  my  neighbour,  Mr.  Slater, 
F.G.S. ;  and  there  are  others  also  to  whom  I  am 
similarly  indebted,  but  who  would  prefer  their  names 
not  being  mentioned. 


X  PREFA  CE. 

In  conclusion,  I  must  not  send  forth  my  book 
without  a  word  of  greeting  to  those  who  honoured 
me  by  perusing  "^'Through  Siberia,'*  whether  in  English 
or  in  the  languages  of  Germany  and  Scandinavia. 
1  shall  be  gratified  if  the  present  volumes  recall  to 
their  minds  an  old  aquaintance,  who  afforded  them 
amusement,  or  what  is  better,  imparted  instruction. 
But  I  take  it  to  be  the  greatest  and  best  reward 
of  an  author,  when  his  thoughts  and  emotions  so 
enter  the  soul  of  a  reader  as  to  influence  him  to 
action.  It  was  the  perusal  of  a  book,  more  than 
twenty  years  ago,*  that  turned  the  current  of  my  life, 
and  changed  my  religion  from  an  educational  habit 
to  something  very  much  deeper, — which  brought,  in 
fact,  such  joy  to  myself  that  I  was  never  so  happy  as 
when  trying  to  impart  its  secret  to  others.  After 
this,  none  need  wonder  at  my  faith  in  the  distribution 
of  religious  literature ;  and  happy  shall  I  be  if,  in 
and  beneath  this  story  of  travel  by  land  and  by 
water,  one  and  another  shall  recognize  the  work  of 
a  fellow-labourer  unto  the  kingdom  of  God,  and  be 
encouraged  to  go  and  do  likewise.

OBSERVANDA. 


In  proper  names  the  letters  should  be  pronounced  as  follows: — 
^  as  in  father ;  ^  as  in  th^e ;  /  as  in  rav/ne ;  o  3iS  in  go;  z^  as  in 
If^nar ;  and  the  diphthongs  at  and  et  as  /'  in  h/de.  The  consonants 
are  pronounced  as  in  English,  save  that  kA  is  guttural,  as  cA  in  the 
Scotch  loch. 

Unless  otherwise  stated: — 

1.  The  dates  are  given  according  to  English  reckoning,  being  in 
advance  of  the  Russian  by  twelve  days. 

2.  English  weights  and  measures  are  to  be  understood. 

3.  Degrees  of  temperature  are  expressed  according  to  the  scale  of 
Fahrenheit. 

The  ordinary  paper  rouble  is  reckoned  at  two  shillings,  its  value 
at  the  time  of  the  Author's  visit :  but  before  the  Russo-Turkish  war 
in  1877,  it  was  worth  between  half-a-crowu  and  three  shillings. 

The  Russian  paper  rouble  (or  100  kopecks)  equals  2  shillings  English.

CHAPTER  I. 

INTRODUCTORY, 


Intention  to  cross  the  Steppe  frustrated  in  1879. — Considered  afresh  in 
1882. — Distribution  of  religious  literature  desirable. — Reasons  for 
and  against  the  venture. — The  way  cleared. — My  objects  chiefly 
religious. — Help  of  Bible  and  Tract  Societies. — Plans  in  relation 
thereto. — ^Additional  objects. — Failure  anticipated  by  some. — Fears 
enteitained  by  others. — The  start. 

WHEN  passing  through  Ekaterineburg  in  1879, 
I  heard  of  a  people  in  the  south,  wandering 
about  in  so  primitive  a  condition  with  their  flocks  and 
herds,  that,  when  among  them,  one  might  fancy  himself 
on  a  visit  to  the  Hebrew  patriarchs.  This  so  far 
interested  me  that  I  determined,  on  my  way  back,  to 
pass  through  the  Kirghese  country  from  Omsk  to 
Orenburg.  But  I  was  prevented  from  doing  this  by 
journeying  all  across  Asia,  making  a  circuit  of  the 
world.  Once  more  safe  home,  so  far  was  it  from  my 
wish  to  travel  extensively  again,  that  I  had  asked  my

friends  to  look  out  for  me  a  suitable  sphere  of  parish 
work. 

My  Siberian  experience,  however,  had  fostered  in 
my  mind  another  idea,  which,  on  the  Pacific,  came  to 
maturity.  I  had  taken  notes  to  serve  possibly  for 
public  correspondence,  or  for  a  book,  and  during  the 
voyage  between  Japan  and  San  Francisco,  I  read 
my  experiences  to  some  of  my  fellow-passengers  in 
the  saloon.  Among  these  evening  audiences  was  Sir 
Harry  Parkes,  K.C.B.,  then  our  Envoy  Extraordinary 
and  Minister  Plenipotentiary  in  Japan,  who,  seeing 
that  my  story  was  so  different  from  that  commonly 
believed  respecting  Siberia,  thought  that  such  testi- 
mony, if  published,  might  do  something  towards 
softening  the  asperity  which  then  existed  between 
England  and  Russia,  and  his  Excellency  further  re- 
minded me  that  there  are  important  means  of  doing 
good,  and  many  **  missions  "  in  life,  other  than  those 
of  our  religious  societies.  This  thought  reconciled  me, 
on  my  return,  to  the  expenditure  of  the  inside  of 
many  weeks  in  writing  my  book,  whilst  on  Sundays  I 
officiated  at  a  neighbouring  church.  When  the  book 
was  finished,  I  was  invited  to  the  pastoral  charge  of 
a  contemplated  parochial  district,  and  whilst  this  was 
under  consideration,  I  was  pounced  upon  to  be  editor 
in  a  proposed  religious  literary  undertaking.  Thus 
1882  dawned  upon  me,  seemingly,  with  an  open  door 
on  either  hand,  whilst  the  desire  to  journey  through 
Central  Asia  was  smouldering  in  my  breast.  Neither 
the  pastoral  nor  the  literary  undertaking  was  carried 
out,  and  it  then  remained  for  me  to  consider  whether 
I  should  go  to  Central  Asia. 

I  gave  a  day  to  weighing  the  question,  and,  taking 
the  Russian  kalendar  and  the  post-book,  elicited  from 


INTROD  UCTOR  F. 


them  that  a  traveller  passing  from  Orenburg  by  the 
post-road  round  Russian  Central  Asia  (without  entering 
Kuldja,  Bokhara,  or  Khiva)  would  traverse  eight 
provinces,  with  a  total  population  of  4,908,000,*  and 
that  he  would  pass  through  upwards  of  20  towns  with 
populations  varying  from  i  ,000  to  80,000,  besides  300 
villages  and  post-stations.  Of  all  these  towns  I  knew 
of  only  one  (or  perhaps  two)  to  which  the  British  and 
Foreign  Bible  Society  had  been  able  to  send  a  con- 
signment of  Scriptures,  and,  judging  from  my  experience 
in  other  parts  of  the  Empire,  I  fully  anticipated  that 
the  prisons,  hospitals,  barracks,  and  schools  would  be 
insufficiently  supplied,  or  not  supplied  at  all,  with  the 
Scriptures  or  other  religious  reading.  It  seemed  to 
me,  therefore,  that  a  general  distribution  of  such 
literature  would  be  a  blessing  to  the  people,  and 
remembering  that,  according  to  Russian  law,  no  foreign 
missionaries  may  labour  in  the  Empire,  there  appeared 
to  be  the  greater  reason,  from  my  point  of  view,  for 
spreading  the  written  Word  where  the  spoken  word 
could  not  go. 

Having  thus  made  out  a  case  of  need,  the  next 
question  was,  **  Am  /  the  man  to  go  ? "  Towards  an 
answer  in  the  affirmative  the  following  considerations 
pointed  : — i.  My  previous  experience  had  been  a 
training,  and  I  possessed  certain  preliminary  advan- 
tages for  such  a  work,  because,  having  been  five  times 
on  a  like  holiday  errand,  and  so  become  known  to  the 
Russian  authorities,  it  might  be  that,  though  they  have 
restrained   others   from  going   to  Central  Asia,  they

would  perhaps  allow  me  to  do  so.  2.  The  condition 
of  Russo-English  political  affairs  favoured  the  project 
being  attempted  at  once,  for  the  **  Eastern  Question  " 
raised  again  might  cause  the  Russians  to  object.  3. 
If  I  did  not  go,  I  had  no  reason  to  suppose  that  anyone 
else  would. 

The  first  of  these  reasons  weighed  with  me  heavily, 
all  the  more  so  perhaps  because  of  a  short  extract 
from  Carlyle  which  had  come  under  my  notice  a  few 
days  previously.  It  was  this  : — **  Modern  majesty 
consists  in  work.  What  a  man  can  do  is  his  greatest 
ornament,  and  he  always  consults  his  dignity  by  doing 
it,"  and  when  I  looked  at  the  third  consideration  in 
the  light  of  a  higher  teaching,  **  To  him  that  knoweth 
to  do  good,  and  doeth  it  not,  to  him  it  is  sin,"  I  felt 
that  my  disinclination  thereto  must  give  way  if  I  saw 
anything  like  an  outward  call  to  the  work.  If  my 
thoughts  were  providential  leadings,  and  not  mere 
cogitations,  I  thought  I  might  reasonably  expect  that 
my  outward  surroundings  would  in  some  way  be 
adapted  to  the  work  before  me.  Now  I  calculated 
that,  if  the  journey  could  be  accomplished  in  from  four 
to  five  months,  it  might  cost  at  least  ;^400,  and,  though 
I  did  not  see  it  to  be  my  duty  to  bear  the  whole  expense 
of  the  undertaking,  yet  I  resolved  that  if  the  cost  of 
travel  were  forthcoming,  from  whence  I  did  not  know, 
I  was  prepared  to  give  my  time  and  energy.  And  in 
this  direction  my  way  was  cleared  in  the  next  few 
days,  for,  having  put  my  project  on  paper,  I  showed  it 
to  a  friend,  who  urged  me  to  go,  and  offered  ;^5o 
towards  the  expenses.  I  then  submitted  my  plans  to 
the  Committee  of  the  British  and  Foreign  Bible  Society, 
who  had  been  wishing  to  extend  their  work  into  Siberia 
(especially  since  my  return    from   thence),    and   who 


INTRODUCTORY.  5 

desired  also  to  penetrate  to  other  new  regions  as 
opportunity  offered.  The  Committee  had  on  several 
occasions  given  me  introductions  to  their  agents,  and 
grants  of  books  for  my  holiday  tours,  together  with  a 
sum  of  money  on  one  occasion  towards  the  cost  of 
carriage  of  the  books,  and  they  now  hailed  with  thanks 
my  new  proposal.  In  fact,  so  hearty  was  the  reception 
accorded  to  me,  that  my  courage  rose  to  the  occasion, 
and,  instead  of  asking  for  a  grant  of  ;^ioo,  as  I  intended, 
I  asked  for  ;^200,  which  was  given  me,  and  as  I  left 
the  room  a  member  of  the  Committee,  to  whom  I  was 
a  perfect  stranger,  offered  me  ;^50  more.  I  then  told 
my  story  to  the  Committee  of  the  Religious  Tract 
Society,  whose  generous  grants  have  encouraged  me 
to  distribute  more  than  1 00,000  of  their  publications, 
and  they  gave  me  ;^ioo,  which,  with  ;^io  sent  un- 
asked for  by  another  friend,  led  me  to  decline  with 
thanks  another  proffered  cheque,  on  the  plea  that  I 
thought  I  had  enough. 

Here,  then,  end  the  esoteric  antecedents  of  my 
journey  to  Central  Asia,  which  I  have  been  telling  the 
reader  in  my  sanctum.  If  in  so  doing  I  seem  to  have 
obtruded  what  may  be  regarded  as  private  affairs,  I 
would  urge  that  I  have  thought  it  right  that  the 
societies  which  gave  me  help  should  receive  a  public 
recognition  thereof,  whilst,  as  for  my  personal  motives, 
I  see  no  good  reason  to  withhold  them.  One  of  the 
critics  of  "  Through  Siberia  "  wrote :  **  The  utmost 
commendation  must  be  given  to  the  reverend  author, 
not  only  for  his  personal  work,  but  for  the  good  taste 
that  has  impelled  him  to  describe  his  religious  labours 
in  language  understanded  of  the  laity."  That  this  was 
written  by  a  kindly  pen  I  am  sure ;  but,  I  suppose,  a 
perverse  mind  might  misinterpret  it  to  mean  that  I 


6  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

had  said  too  little  of  my  religious  labours.  Some  of 
my  friends  thought  so.  But  I  did  not  then  set  out  to 
write  a  missionary's  report,  nor  am  I  doing  so  now, 
though  I  wish  it  to  be  clearly  understood  that  the 
religious  character  of  my  journey  was  paramount.  It 
heightened  every  pleasure,  and  softened  what  perhaps 
I  may  not  call  hardships,  but  my  every  inconvenience 
and  fatigue,  whilst,  in  reviewing  the  whole,  it  is  incom- 
parably that  portion  of  the  expedition  which  affords 
me  the  greatest  amount  of  present  satisfaction. 

The  object,  then,  of  my  journey,  so  far  as  the  Bible 
and  Tract  societies  are  concerned,  was  fourfold : — 

1.  In  1879,  besides  distributing  more  than  50,000 
tracts  and  other  religious  publications,  I  gave  to  the 
authorities  more  than  sufficient  copies  of  the  New 
Testament  and  the  four  Gospels,  to  enable  them  to 
place  one  (sometimes  more)  in  every  room  of  every 
prison  and  every  hospital  in  all  Siberia,  so  that,  where 
my  directions  have  been  properly  carried  out,  every 
prisoner  and  hospital  patient  ought  to  have  within 
reach  at  all  times  of  the  day,  and  without  having  to 
ask  for  it  from  the  library,  a  copy  of  some  portion  of  the 
Word  of  God.  In  1882  I  wished  to  do  the  same  for 
the  prisons  and  hospitals  of  Russian  Central  Asia,  thus 
completing  my  work  for  the  whole  of  Asiatic  Russia. 

2.  Besides  supplying  the  prisons,  hospitals,  and 
other  public  institutions  with  religious  literature,  I  was 
anxious  to  do  something  of  a  similar  character  for  the 
many  thousands  of  Russian  exiles,  who  are  compulsory 
colonists,  or  who,  after  a  short  term  in  prison,  are 
released  to  colonize  in  remote  parts  of  Siberia,  where 
it  is  all  but  impossible  for  them  to  procure  religious 
books.  I  hoped  to  effect  this  by  making  some  arrange- 
ment of  a  permanent  character,  by  which  books  might 


INTRODUCTORY,  7 

be  distributed  to  these  exiles  as  they  pass  through 
Tiumen,  the  general  dep6t,  whence  they  are  forwarded 
to  their  far-distant  destinations. 

3.  As  I  should  be  passing  through  regions  where 
the  Bible  is  all  but  unknown,  and  religious  tracts 
unheard  of — where,  moreover,  the  people  might  not 
have  another  opportunity  of  procuring  them  locally 
for  many  years — I  wished  generally  to  sell  and  dis- 
tribute as  many  as  possible* 

4.  My  route  lying  through  new  countries,  I  was  to 
inquire  what  need  there  existed  for  making  new 
translations,  and  to  see  what  openings  presented 
themselves  for  promoting  generally  the  objects  of 
the  two  societies. 

These  were  my  religious  aims ;  but  if  I  had  in- 
tended to  make  them  the  boundary  of  my  horizon,  my 
friends  were  determined  that  they  should  not  remain 
so.  One  asked  me  to  make  a  collection  of  flower 
seeds,  botanical  specimens,  beetles  and  butterflies.  I 
replied  that  I  should  not  remain  long  enough  in  the 
different  places  for  this,  and  that  it  would  be  a 
curious  telegram  to  send  on  ahead  to  a  stranger, 
"  Please  have  in  readiness  for  me,  on  such  a  day 
and  hour,  half-a-dozen  horses,  the  samovar  for  tea, 
and — a  collection  of  the  butterflies,  beetles,  and  plants 
of  the  neighbourhood !  *'  My  friend,  however,  urged 
that  the  pursuit  of  the  required  game  would  be  a 
healthful  recreation  for  the  parties  concerned,  and  I 
accordingly  gave  a  vague  promise  that  I  would  see 
what  could  be  done.  Then,  my  friend  Mr.  Henry 
Howorth,  learning  that  I  was  going  among  his  dear 
**  Mongols,"  of  whom  he  has  written  so  voluminously, 
not  only  tried  to  interest  me  in  them,  but  set  on 
me   his   friend,    Mr.  Augustus  Franks,   F.S.A.,   who 


»  JRUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

honoured  me  by  a  request  that  I  would  collect  for 
him  ethnographical  specimens  and  antiquities  for  the 
British  Museum.  Added  to  this,  I  thought  I  might 
perhaps  search  with  success  for  Hebrew  manuscripts 
in  Bokhara.  My  neighbour,  Mr.  Glaisher,  F.R.S.,  of 
meteorological  fame,  as  on  a  previous  occasion,  lent 
me  some  of  his  instruments  for  taking  observations ; 
and,  besides  all  this,  I  had  sundry  editorial  friends, 
who  wished  me  to  see  and  take  notes  of  everything 
possible,  and  write  to  them  something  thereon. 

Of  course,  there  were  not  wanting  those  who 
thought  my  project  a  hopeless  one*  Had  not  other 
Englishmen  tried  in  vain  to  penetrate  to  Russian 
Central  Asia?  And  was  not  one  of  them — a  clergy- 
man, too,  who  proceeded  by  stealth  as  far  as 
Tashkend — ordered  to  be  off  within  four-and-twenty 
hours  ?  Did  I  then  expect  to  get  to  Bokhara }  to 
which,  on  one  occasion  when  I  answered  in  the 
affirmative,  my  questioner  sank  back  in  his  chair  with 
a  look  indicating  that  he  deemed  it  utterly  useless  to 
have  anything  more  to  say  to  me. 

But,  besides  these  of  little  faith,  there  were  some 
of  my  older  friends  who  looked  back  40  years,  and 
recalled  that  the  last  two  Englishmen  who  entered 
Bokhara  were  put  to  death,  and  that  Dr.  Wolff,  who 
went  to  ascertain  their  fate,  nearly  lost  his  lite.  By 
them  I  was  thought  to  be  entering  on  a  dangerous 
enterprise  ;  but  I  was  able  to  assure  them  that  I  had 
not  the  slightest  intention  of  putting  my  head  into  the 
lion's  mouth  merely  for  the  satisfaction  of  saying  that 
I  had  done  so,  and  that,  unless  I  had  not  only  the 
permission,  but  the  cordial  support  of  the  Russians,  I 
should  probably  not  enter  Bokhara.  If,  however,  I 
am  to  be  candid,  I  must  admit  that  I  was  not  without 


INTRODUCTORY.  9 

fear.  I  realized  it  to  be  the  most  dangerous  journey 
I  had  undertaken,  to  this  extent,  at  all  events,  that  as 
our  worthy  forefathers  used  to  make  their  wills  before 
setting  out  on  a  journey  from  York  to  London,  so  I 
copied  their  example,  and  set  my  house  in  order.  I 
then  committed  myself  into  His  keeping  in  whose 
name  I  was  going  forth,  and— started. 


CHAPTER  II. 

FROM  LONDON  TO  THE   URALS. 

Five  routes  to  Central  Asia. — Departure  for  Petersburg.— Favourable 
reception. — Official  letters  and  favours. — Scientific  acquaintances 
and  introductions. — Departure  for  Moscow. — National  Exhibition 
and  St.  Saviour's  Cathedral. — Mr.  Alfred  Sevier  as  interpreter. — 
Our  arrival  at  Perm. — Purchase  of  tarantass  and  medicines. — De- 
parture for  the  Urals. — Tract  distribution. — Arrested  and  brought 
back  to  Perm. — Examined  and  released  with  apologies. — My  own 
fault. — Exaggerated  reports  in  newspapers. — ^A  fresh  start. 

THERE  are  at  least  five  routes  between  London 
and  Russian  Central  Asia.  The  most  soutlierly 
of  these  would  be  by  the  Mediterranean  to  the  Tigris 
valley,  through  Persia  to  Meshed,  and  then  across  the 
desert  by  Merv  and  Charjui  to  Bokhara,  and  Samarkand. 
By  this  route  I  thought  perhaps  to  have  returned,  but 
was  assured,  by  Russians  and  natives  alike,  that  it  would 
be  next  to  impossible  for  me  to  escape  the  Turkomans 
between  the  Oxus  and  Merv.  The  second  route  is 
that  by  which  I  came  back ;  namely,  Odessa  and  the 
Crimea,  across  the  Caucasus  and  Caspian  to  Krasno- 
vodsk,  then  by  camels  to  Khiva,  whence  there  is  a 
caravan  road  to  Bokhara,  or  another  on  Russian 
territory  through  Petro-Alexandrovsk  and  Jizak  to 
Tashkend.  He  should  be  a  sturdy  traveller,  however, 
who  would  attempt  this  route.  A  third  way  would  be 
by  rail  to  Orenburg,  and  then  following  the  post-road 


FROM  LONDON  TO  THE  URALS,  ii 

along  the  Syr-daria  to  Tashkend.  This  is  the  best 
route  in  autumn,  but  a  difficuh  one  in  spring,  by  reason 
of  floods  and  lack  of  horses.  The  fourth  rOute,  which 
I  thought  at  first  to  follow,  is  from  Orenburg  to  Omsk 
and  Semipolatinsk,  and  so  past  Lake  Balkhash  and 
Vierny  to  Tashkend.  My  plans  for  the  exiles,  howeven 
rendered  it  necessary  that  I  should  go  to  Tiumen,  and 
I  therefore  followed  the  fifth  route,  which,  though 
longest,  is,  in  spring,  decidedly  the  easiest,  namely,  by 
rail  to  Nijni  Novgorod,  by  steamer  to  Perm,  by  rail 
and  post  to  Tiumen,  whence  steamers  ply  on  the  Irtish 
to  Semipolatinsk,  and  so  onwards  by  posting  as  in  the 
previous  route. 

I  left  London  on  the  evening  of  the  26th  June  1882, 
and,  three  evenings  later,  reached  Petersburg,  to  find 
at  the  terminus  the  English  tutor  of  the  Grand  Duke 
Michael,  uncle  of  the  Emperor,  whose  wife,  the  Grand 
Duchess  Olga,  had  thus  honoured  me  by  sending  to 
inquire  when  I  could  come  out  to  the  Michailovsky 
dacha,  or  summer  palace,  to  lunch.  I  named  the 
morrow,  and  was  then  privileged  to  renew  an  acquaint- 
anceship formed  two  years  previously  at  Borjom,  when 
I  asked  permission  of  the  Grand  Duke  Michael  to 
place  copies  of  the  Scriptures  in  the  prisons  and 
hospitals  of  the  Caucasus.  His  Imperial  Highness 
heard  with  interest  of  my  projected  journey,  warned 
me  that  I  should  be  unable  to  pass  from  Charjui  to 
Merv  (though  I  might  reach  the  latter,  he  thought, 
from  the  Russian  side),  and  kindly  gave  me  a  letter 
of  introduction  to  Count  Tolstoy,  the  Minister  of  the 
I  nterior. 

I  had  sent  to  this  statesman,  as  head  of  the  prison 
department,  a  few  days  previously,  a  copy  of  my 
** Through  Siberia,"  so  that  with  him  the  tongue  of 


12  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

gcxxl  report  had  already  been  heard  in  my  favour;  and 
upon  presenting  my  letter  on  the  ist  of  July,  the 
Count's  opening  words  to  me  were  of  thanks  for  the 
book,  which,  notwithstanding  the  pressure  of  official 
duties,  he  said  he  had  found  leisure  to  peruse,  and  had 
done  so  with  the  greatest  pleasure.  The  Count  then 
listened  to  the  story  of  my  projected  tour,  asked  what 
I  wanted,  and  said,  "  I  will  do  all  that  I  can  to  help 
you."  Thus,  providentially,  I  had  leaped  into  the  right 
quarter  at  a  bound,  and  within  eight-and-forty  hours 
of  my  reaching  Petersburg  had  virtually  obtained  per- 
mission to  do  what  I  wished. 

A  few  days  later  I  received  an  official  letter  of 
thanks  for  my  book,  and  also  a  separate  commendatory 
letter  (not  one  circular  document,  as  in  previous  years) 
to  the  governor  of  each  of  the  provinces  through  which 
I  was  to  pass. 

The  Count  had  thus  redeemed  his  promise,  but  I 
made  bold  to  ask  another  favour,  and  a  great  one, — so 
great,  indeed,  that  I  did  not  until  afterwards  realize 
its  magnitude.  I  begged  to  be  allowed  to  see  the 
political  prison  in  the  fortress  of  SS.  Peter  and  Paul. 
Count  Tolstoy  at  first  said  *'  No,*'  but  subsequently  I 
was  allowed  to  do  so,  and  I  shall  give  hereafter  an 
account  of  what  I  saw ;  but  I  may  add  that,  as  I  was 
leaving  the  prison,  I  asked  one  of  the  officials  if  visitors 
like  myself  were  often  thus  admitted.  He  replied  that 
he  had  been  there  22  years,  and  had  never  seen  one 
before ! 

But  there  were  other  magnates  to  be  seen,  especially 
one  who  happened  to  be  in  Petersburg — I  mean  General 
Tchernaieff,  then  recently  appointed  Governor-General 
of  Turkistan.  Here  I  have  thankfully  to  acknowledge 
the  help  of  a  letter  from  our  Foreign  Office  to  the 


FROM  LONDON  TO  THE  URALS.  13 

English  Ambassador,  Sir  Edward  Thornton,  K.C.B., 
who  had  left  the  capital  a  few  days  previously  for  the 
country,  but  who  was  represented  by  Lord  Frederick 
Hamilton.  Lord  Frederick  most  kindly  procured  for 
me,  from  the  Asiatic  department,  a  letter  to  the 
Governor-General,  which,  on  being  presented,  was 
duly  honoured,  and  I  was  furnished  with  an  open 
document  that  made  me  the  envy  of  several  would-be 
travellers  in  Turkistan.  After  this  a  letter  was  given 
me  from  the  Post  Office  authorities  to  assist  me  in 
procuring  horses,  and  thus  my  official  papers  were 
complete. 

But  I  could  not  yet  start  for  lack  of  an  interpreter, 
and  I  wished  to  procure  numerous  introductions.    Here 
the  letters  of  my  scientific  friends,  and  my  preparations 
for  the  execution  of  their  commissions,  stood  me  in 
good  stead.     The  Grand  Duke  Nicolai,  eldest  son  of 
the  Grand  Duke  Michael,  is  an  ardent  lepidopterist, 
and  has  a  magnificent  collection  of  butterflies.     His 
Imperial   Highness  introduced  me  to  his  curator,  Dr. 
Gustav  Sievers,  who  gave  me  sundry  hints  and  aids,  as 
also  did  Dr.  Strauch,  the  Director  of  the  Zoological 
Museum,  to  whom  I  was  introduced  by  Mr.  Vessilovski, 
the   Secretary   of  the   Academy   of  Sciences.      The 
Imperial  Geographical  Society  is  an  influential  asso- 
ciation in  Russia,  and  extends  its  operations  over  a 
wider  field  of  science  than  its  name  implies.    From  Mr. 
Vice-President  Semenoff*,  and  the  obliging  Secretary, 
Mr.  V.  J.  de  Sreznevski,   I  obtained  many  introduc- 
tions.    I  made,  too,  the  acquaintance  of  Baron  Osten- 
Sacken,  Director  of  the  House  of  the  General  Staff"; 
Baron  Rosen,   Professor  of  Oriental   Literature  ;    Dr. 
Regel,  the  Director  of   the   Botanical  Gardens  ;    Dr. 
Albert  Harkavy,  of  the  Imperial  Library ;  and  Private 


14  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Councillor  Grimm,  an  antiquarian,  whom  I  found  in 
the  department  of  coins  in  the  Hermitage  ;  as  also  of 
several  literary  gentlemen,  all  of  whom  received  me 
kindly,  and  most  of  whom  gave  me  or  put  me  in  the 
way  of  procuring  information  respecting  the  little- 
known  parts  whither  I  was  proceeding. 

But  to  Petersburg,  indeed,  was  a  **  far  cry  '*  from 
Central  Asia,  and  I  hoped  to  feel  nearer  at  Moscow, 
as  there  was  the  chance  of  meeting  persons  from  the 
East,  and,  as  I  hoped,  about  to  return.  This  anticipa- 
tion was  fulfilled  on  the  first  evening  I  was  there,  for 
whilst  in  Kamensky's  office,  arranging  about  the 
carriage  of  my  books,  there  came  in  two  men  of  dark 
complexion,  whom  I  ventured  to  ask  from  whence 
they  hailed.  They  said  they  came  from  Bokhara,  and 
told  me  of  two  others  from  the  same  place  staying  in 
Moscow.  Afterwards,  strangely  enough,  as  I  was 
leaving  the  office,  there  passed  by  a  Jew,  whom  I 
saluted  and  found  that  he,  too,  was  a  dweller  in 
the  city  of  the  Emir.  These  men  gave  me  sundry 
pieces  of  valuable  information,  and  cleared  up  several 
obscure  points,  so  that  already  some  of  the  dangers 
I  had  supposed  to  becloud  my  way  began  to  dis- 
perse. 

There  were  two  sights  at  Moscow  I  wished  to  see 
in  passing,  namely,  the  National  Exhibition,  and  the 
new  Cathedral  of  the  Saviour.  I  had  the  advantage 
of  visiting  the  former  with  our  obliging  Vice-Consul, 
Mr.  N.  W.  Hornstedt,  who  had  intended  to  draw  up 
a  report  with  a  view  to  giving  such  information 
respecting  the  exhibition  as  would  be  interesting  to 
English  men  of  commerce.  The  exhibition  was  sup- 
posed to  be  restricted  to  manufactures  and  productions 
of  the  Russian  Empire,  upon  which  feature  the  Mus- 


FROM  LONDON  TO  THE  URALS.  15 

covites  plumed  themselves  duly,  though  the  boast 
would  not  bear  too  rigid  an  investigation,  for  one 
wickedly  disposed  might  twit  his  Russian  friends  by 
reminding  them  that  some  of  the  things  they  claimed 
for  their  own  were  in  reality  the  outcome  of  English 
brains  and  hands,  as,  for  instance,  an  excellent  boiler 
made  in  the  Baltic  Provinces,  and  so  admissible  to  the 
exhibition,  but  fabricated  of  English  plates  by  British 
workmen.  I  must  not  be  tempted  to  enlarge  upon 
details,  but  will  only  add  that  the  sight,  as  a  whole, 
interested  me  exceedingly,  illustrating,  as  it  did  so 
vividly,  the  enormous  size  and  immense  fecundity  of 
the  Empire.  The  products  of  the  frigid  stood  side  by 
side  with  those  of  regions  near  the  torrid  zone,  and 
there  seemed  to  be  no  variety  of  human  wants  which 
Russia  was  unable  to  supply  either  from  above  or 
below  ground. 

As  for  the  Cathedral  of  the  Saviour,  built  in  Ancient 
Russian  or  rather  Graeco- Byzantine  style,  a  remarkable 
fact  in  my  eyes  was  that  it  had  been  erected  in  a 
single  lifetime,  and  that  there  was  given  to  the  people 
of  Moscow,  what  falls  to  the  lot  of  few  generations 
to  see — a  grand  cathedral  new  in  all  its  parts.  The 
building,  covering  an  area  of  73,000  square  feet, 
awaited  consecration,  and  was  rigidly  closed  to  the 
public,  except  by  special  order  of  the  Governor,  with 
which  I  was  favoured.  I  will  mention  only  a  few 
data  to  show  on  what  magnificent  lines  it  has  been 
built.  Thus,  on  the  exterior  of  the  building,  900  lbs. 
of  gold  were  used  for  overlaying  its  five  cupolas.  Of 
its  13  bells  the  largest  weighs  half  as  much  again  as 
"Great  Paul"  in  London,  and  the  doors  of  the  temple, 
of  which  the  largest  weighs  13  tons,  cost  ;^62,ooo. 
As  for  the  interior,  I  have  seen  most  of  the  celebrated 


i6  JRUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

cathedrals  in  Europe,  but  I  know  of  nothing  so  exquisite 
as  St.  Saviour's.  It  reminded  me  most  of  the  interior 
of  Santa  Sophia,  at  Constantinople.  The  floor  is  of 
marble,  and  the  walls  are  lined  with  exquisite  varieties 
of  the  same  material,  the  entire  cost  of  marble  alone 
having  exceeded  ;^300,ooo.  Round  the  cupola  are 
two  rows  of  1,240  candelabra,  placed  there  at  a  cost 
of  nearly  ;^40,ooo,  and  nearly  as  much  as  this  was 
expended  on  the  materials  and  workmanship  of  the 
altar  space,  without  reckoning  its  ikons  and  pictures, 
of  which  latter  the  church  is  full.  This  costly  fane 
has  been  erected  at  a  cost  of  two  and  a  quarter  million 
pounds  sterling,  and  is  said  to  be  capable  of  accom- 
modating 10,000  worshippers. 

I  was  able,  in  Moscow,  to  add  to  my  store  of  intro- 
ductions, and  would  gladly  have  pushed  forward,  only 
that  I  had  not  yet  lighted  upon  a  suitable  interpreter. 
Thanks  to  the  kindness  of  friends  who  had  been  on 
the  look-out  before  my  arrival,  I  found  several  in 
Petersburg  who  were  willing  at  first  to  go,  but  sub- 
sequently some  were  alarmed  at  reports  of  Turkistan 
tigers  and  fevers  ;  others  were  weak  in  Russian,  in 
English,  or  in  health  ;  whilst  a  fourth,  who  would  have 
made  hardly  a  companion,  but  an  energetic  courier, 
was  eventually  kept  back  by  the  entreaties  of  his 
wife.  I  had  called  one  morning  at  Messrs.  Egerton 
Hubbards'  to  inquire  for  an  interpreter,  and  was 
driving  away  almost  in  despair,  and  wondering  that  my 
way  in  other  things  should  have  been  made  so  clear, 
whilst  in  this  it  seemed  blocked,  when  a  gentleman 
named  Sevier  drove  alongside  my  droshky,  and  said 
he  had  heard  I  needed  an  interpreter.  He  was 
doubtful  as  to  whether  he  could  offer  his  own  services, 
but  if  not,  he  thought  his  brother  at  Vienna  might  like 


FROM  LONDON  TO  THE  URALS.  17 

to  go.  This  was  on  the  8th  July,  and  I  left  Peters- 
burg on  the  nth,  with  this  offer  in  reserve  to  be 
arranged  by  correspondence  or  telegram,  if  I  met  with 
no  one  more  suitable  at  Moscow.  Here  again  were 
two  or  three  who  would  have  liked  to  go,  one  of 
whom  I  had  added  as  a  second  string  to  my  bow, 
when,  on  the  morning  of  the  day  I  was  to  proceed  on 
a  short  visit  to  the  interior,  I  received  a  telegram  from 
Petersburg  that  Mr.  Alfred  Sevier  was  willing  to  join 
me  from  Vienna.  My  mind  was  so  evenly  balanced 
between  the  claims  of  two  persons  that  I  knew  not 
how  to  decide ;  but  at  length  I  telegraphed,  **  Please 
let  him  come  immediately,  and  catch  me  as  quickly 
as  he  can"  ;  and  this  Mr.  Sevier  did  on  the  steamer 
going  to  Perm,  where  we  arrived  on  the  29th  of  July. 

We  were  met  by  an  Englishman,  Mr.  Parsons,  junr., 
who,  with  his  young  wife,  accorded  us  a  hearty  and 
'hospitable  welcome,  and  assisted  me  in  the  important 
^  chase  of  a  tarantass,  or  travelling  carriage,  which 
was  expected  to  carry  us  3,000  miles,  and  to  be  our 
dwelling  and  sleeping  place  for  a  long  succession  of 
days  and  nights.  Of  two  Mr.  Parsons  had  selected 
for  my  approval,  I  chose  the  larger,  its  extreme  inside 
measurements  being  6  ft.  8  in.  long,  by  3  ft.  8  in.  wide, 
and  4  ft.  4  in.  from  the  floor  to  the  top  of  the  hood.  It 
was  not  quite  new,  but  came  from  the  best  of  builders 
— Romanoff,  of  Kazan — and  notwithstanding  that  it 
cost  me  heavily  for  carriage  from  Perm,  it  proved  an 
excellent  bargain,  though  had  I  not  bought  it  on 
such  favourable  terms,  I  should  have  done  better 
under  ordinary  circumstances  to  have  obtained  one 
in  Ekaterineburg. 

Perm  was  to  be  the  last  town  we  passed  through 
before  leaving  Europe,  so  that  I  took  the  opportunity 

VOL.  I.  2 


i8  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

to  make  a  few  purchases,  whilst  Mrs.  Parsons  kindly 
added  to  our  eatables  a  valuable  store  of  cherry  jam. 
Mr.  Alfred  Hynam  Sevier,  M.B.,  proved  to  be  a 
physician  who  had  just  finished  his  studies  at  Edinburgh, 
Paris,  and  Vienna.  It  struck  me  accordingly  as  highly 
proper — nay,  also  having  Scriptural  precedent — that 
the  practice  of  divinity  and  medicine  should  go  to- 
gether, and  I  therefore  commissioned  my  companion 
to  invest  a  sovereign  in  drugs,  so  that  we  might  physic 
right  and  left  as  occasion  might  require  or  oppor- 
tunity might  serve.  We  were  then  ready  to  proceed, 
and  on  the  evening  of  the  30th,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Parsons, 
in  Russian  fashion,  accompanied  us  to  the  station  to 
see  us  off.  The  occasion  was  almost  a  grand  one.  I 
was  introduced  to  the  station-master,  who  showed  every 
disposition  to  make  us  comfortable.  The  manager  of 
one  of  the  steamboat  companies  was  there,  and  gave 
me  sundry  pieces  of  advice  respecting  my  journey. 
So,  too,  was  the  principal  doctor  in  the  town,  whom  I 
had  met  in  1879,  and  he  had  brought  with  him  a 
worthy  notary,  who  wished  to  give  me  a  box  of 
beetles  and  butterflies,  whilst  I  was  besides  presented 
to  a  general  officer,  the  brand  new  Governor  of  I  rkutsk, 
on  his  way  to  take  up  his  appointment ;  and  all  this 
before  the  dlite  of  Perm,  who,  in  their  best  attire,  were 
promenading  the  spacious  platform.  One  result  was 
I  fear  that,  for  the  time  being,  I  lost  my  head,  and 
forgot  to  mention  to  the  authorities  a  little  plan  I  had 
in  hand,  the  disastrous  results  of  which  omission  will 
presently  be  seen.  Moreover,  as,  by  some  means  un- 
known to  me,  an  allusion  thereto  got  into  the  Russian 
and  English  newspapers,  I  shall  give  my  narration 
somewhat  in  detail. 

My  books  and  tracts,  as  already  hinted,  were  sent 


FROM  LONDON  TO  THE  URALS.  19 

before  me  to  Moscow,  and  as  I  found  on  arriving  there 
that  I  could  send  them  by  heavy  transit  to  Tiumen,  I 
did  so,  intending  to  make  no  distribution  in  European 
Russia.  I  determined  thus  for  two  reasons ;  partly 
because  of  the  unquiet  state  of  the  country,  and  the 
temporary  trouble  and  delay  I  might  bring  upon  my- 
self by  distributing  pamphlets;  but  more  out  of 
deference  to  what  I  believe  I  may  call  the  conviction 
of  the  Committees  of  the  Bible  and  Religious  Tract 
Societies,  that  in  localities  where  their  colporteurs  are 
at  work,  the  profuse  and  indiscriminate  distribution  of 
Bibles  and  tracts  Is  a  hindrance  to  the  success  of  their 
agents,  inasmuch  as  the  people  decline  to  buy,  and 
sometimes  fail  to  value  religious  reading,  which  they 
can  now  and  again  get  without  so  much  as  asking 
for  it. 

An  amiable  friend,  however,  had  suggested,  and  I 
readily  consented,  that  J  should  take  a  small  bag  of 
bundles  of  tracts,  neatly  wired  together,  supposed  to 
be  suitable  for  offering  to  thoughtful  persons  here  and 
there,  rather  than  for  scattering  by  handfuls  every- 
where ;  and  these  were  to  be  distributed  on  my  way 
to  join  my  boxes  gone  before. 

Accordingly  I  commenced  operations  at  the  first 
railway  station  out  of  Perm,  but  warily  ;  for,  from 
experience,  I  anticipated  that  if,  whilst  the  train  were 
standing,  I  commenced  distribution,  I  should  be  sur- 
rounded with  applicants,  and  the  contents  of  my  bag 
left  nearly  all  in  one  village.  I  therefore  waited  till 
the  train  was  on  the  move,  leaned  out  of  the  window, 
and  placed  a  bundle  of  tracts  in  the  hand  of  the  gen- 
darme on  duty.  At  the  next  station  I  acted  similarly, 
offering  the  packet  to  the  red-capped  station-master, 
who  ran  forward   to   take  it,    but   suddenly   stopped, 


20  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

whereupon  I  threw  the  parcel  at  his  feet.  After  this 
it  became  dusk  ;  so  we  arranged  our  cushions  and 
**  turned  in  ''  for  the  night. 

All  went  peaceably  enough  till  the  train  stopped  at 
Chusovaia,  80  miles  from  Perm,  about  two  o'clock  in 
the  morning,  when  a  gendarme,  on  the  track  of  a 
supposed  Nihilist,  put  his  head  into  the  compartment ; 
but,  over-awed,  I  suppose,  by  the  respectable  appearance 
of  the  persons  within,  withdrew  and  closed  the  door. 
Presently  he  came  again,  but,  his  heart  still  failing  him, 
he  once  more  retired.  On  his  third  attempt,  however, 
he  caught  sight  of  the  tracts  on  the  rack  and  asked  if 
we  had  any  books.  Thinking,  in  the  innocency  of  my 
heart,  that  he  was  in  quest  of  spiritual  food,  I  said 
**  Certainly,"  and  graciously  offered  him  some.  But  he 
looked  severe,  and  said  that  we  and  our  baggage  must 
all  come  out  to  be  examined.  I  laughed,  and  showed 
him,  and  the  station-master  who  had  entered,  my  official 
permission  to  distribute  religious  literature.  The 
station-master  seemed  to  see  that  all  was  right,  but  the 
gendarme  stuck  to  his  prey  like  a  leech,  and  pulled 
from  behind  his  cuff  a  telegram  sent  from  a  previous 
station  by  one  of  his  fraternity.  I  then  went  to  the 
General,  who  was  in  another  carriage,  and  asked  his 
influence  to  set  me  right.  His  Excellency  came,  stood 
at  his  full  height  (which  was  not  diminutive),  and  intro- 
duced himself  to  the  station-master  as  **  the  Governor 
of  Irkutsk."  He  also  read  the  telegram,  but,  shaking 
his  head,  said  he  could  not  help  me,  for  it  was  written 
in  the  despatch  that  "proclamations"  (that  is  Nihilistic 
pamphlets)  had  been  found  in  the  tracts  I  had  given 
away.  I  replied  that  it  was  all  *'  stuff  and  nonsense." 
"  That  is  precisely  what  you  have  to  go  and  prove,"  he 
answered.      "  But   it  will    lose   me   four -and -twenty 


FROM  LONDON  TO  THE  URALS.  21 

hours,"  I  said.  ''  Better  that,"  he  replied,  "  than  four- 
and-twenty  days  "  :  upon  which  I  gave  in,  and  allowed 
my  hand  baggage  to  be  brought  into  the  waiting-room, 
whilst  our  tarantass,  with  portmanteaus,  etc.,  went 
forward. 

We  had  now  to  wait  for  **  the  next  train  up,"  due  in 
about  two  hours,  thus  giving  us  time  to  telegraph 
forward  to  a  friend  to  look  after  our  coming  luggage, 
and  to  Mr.  Parsons,  to  say  that  we  were  returning 
under  arrest  to  Perm.  As  we  sat  in  the  restaurant  we 
were  curiously  eyed  by  the  public  generally,  and  a  posse 
of  gendarmes,  who  at  length  suggested  that  we  should 
change  our  quarters,  for  that  it  was  ''infra  digy  for 
gentlemen  to  be  thus  watched  by  policemen  in  a  first- 
class  waiting-room  ;  to  which  I  replied  that  we  did  not 
feel  in  the  least  ashamed,  and  I  put  on  a  cheerful  look 
accordingly.  Further,  to  improve  the  occasion,  and  as 
the  gendarmes  appeared  to  have  nothing  to  do,  we 
offered  them  to  read  some  of  the  dreadful  pamphlets 
that  had  caused  our  arrest,  but  they  were  afraid 
(probably  of  each  other),  and  said  they  dared  not 
accept  them. 

When  the  train  came  up  we  were  placed  in  a  com- 
partment with  a  gendarme  to  guard  us.  He  was  a  good- 
natured,  respectful  sort  of  fellow,  but  not  very  clear 
in  intellect.  I  said  that  we  had  sent  forward  many 
thousands  of  tracts  to  distribute,  which  intelligence  he 
somehow  muddled  up  with  the  supposition  that  we 
were  going  to  print  them.  Now  the  Russian  word  for 
a  printing  establishment,  if  transliterated  into  English, 
is  "  typography."  and  as  this  word  was  **  much  of  a 
muchness  "  with  a  similar  word  that  had  at  some  time 
passed  through  the  gendarmes  brain,  he  inquired 
whether  we  were  going  to  set  up  a  photography  !    We 


22  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

assured  him  we  intended  nothing  so  seditious  ;  and,  on 
finding  that  he  had  children,  I  offered  him  a  New 
Testament  and  some  tracts,  which  he  stuffed  into  his 
pockets,  and  at  the  next  station  was  relieved  by 
another  of  four  gendarmes  who  were  in  attendance 
upon  us.  We  were  next  under  charge  of  the  little 
ferret-faced  fellow  who  carried  the  telegram,  and  was 
somewhat  disposed  to  give  himself  airs.  Presently  he 
wanted  to  smoke,  which  I  forbade.  He  then  went  to 
do  so  in  the  gangway,  leaving  open  the  door,  which  I 
rose  and  not  very  gently  shut.  He  promptly  re-opened 
it,  whereupon  I  stamped  my  -foot,  and  if  I  did  not 
shake  my  fist  I  let  him  see  unmistakably  that  I  would 
not  have  the  atmosphere  about  me  defiled,  where- 
upon he  made  some  remark  about  my  being  an 
Englishman,  and  caved  in.  We  then  sent  the  little 
man  to  Coventry,  which  exercised  on  him  a  subduing 
effect,  so  that  ere  we  reached  Perm  he  was  getting 
quite  obsequious,  for  he  began  to  suspect  that  he  had 
made  a  mistake. 

On  arriving  at  the  terminus  about  nine  o'clock, 
Mr.  Parsons  and  the  station-master,  true  to  friends  in 
adversity,  were  there  to  meet  us,  and  we  were  asked 
to  be  seated  in  the  gendarmes*  chamber,  where  presently 
arrived  the  Police  Captain  and  the  Procureur  of  the 
Town.  The  Captain's  hair  was  all  sixes  and  sevens  ; 
he  was  smoking,  and  looked  as  if  he  might  have  been 
out  all  night  on  the  spree  ;  whilst  "  Monsieur  le  Pro- 
cureur *'  was  faultlessly  clothed  in  a  dress-coat  of  black, 
with  gold  buttons  and  green  velvet  collar,  with  a  white 
tie  of  spotless  purity,  and  carried  an  important-looking 
portfolio.  He  wore  the  dignified  air  of  a  man  who 
had  serious  business  in  hand,  and  after  allowing  him 
to  settle  himself,  I  opened  fire  by  saying, — 


FROM  LONDON  TO  THE  URALS.  23 

"  Well,  gentlemen,  you  have  brought  us  back  :  pray, 
what  have  I  been  doing  ?" 

"  You  have  been  distributing  proclamations." 

"  Very  good  ;  where  are  they  ?  "  said  I. 

'*  We  have  sent  for  them,  but  the  man  has  not  yet 
come/' 

Here,  then,  things  were  stayed,  for  my  accuser 
was  six  miles  away.  I  therefore  led  off  in  another 
direction,  and  produced  various  documents  I  had  about 
me,  such  as  the  open  letter  of  General  Tchernaieff,  and 
an  old  one  of  the  Minister  of  the  Interior,  and  I  said 
that  I  had  on  my  previous  journey  distributed  more 
than  50,000  books  and  pamphlets  in  Siberia.  I  also 
showed  an  autograph  letter  addressed  to  me  by 
the  Grand  Duchess  Olga,  the  official  letter  of  Count 
Tolstoy,  and  a  communication  from  the  Russian 
Ambassador  in  London,  thanking  me  for  a  copy  of  my 
book  presented  to  the  Emperor.  This  heavy  artillery 
soon  began  to  tell.  The  Captain  allowed  that  from 
my  permission  it  was  clear  I  had  a  right  to  distribute 
the  tracts,  and  the  Procureur  observed  that  it  was 
exceedingly  unlikely  that  persons  With  such  letters  in 
possession  would  be  distributing  proclamations.  An- 
other thought  appeared  then  to  seize  him,  and  he 
asked  whether  I  knew  any  priest  in  the  town,  and  I, 
without  sufficient  thought,  answered  '*  No." 

"  Was  there  a  priest  on  board  the  steamer  when  you 
came  before  "i  " 

"Oh,  yes!"  I  said,  **  I  remember,  he  wished  me  to 
get  a  book  he  had  recently  published  translated  into 
English.'* 

'*Ah !"  said  the  Procureur,  gazing  hard  at  me,  "  I 
remember  you  now,  for  I  also  was  on  board ;  but  at 
that  time  you  wore  a  beard ! ' ' 


24  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

I  produced  evidence  thereof  by  showing  one  of  my 
old  photographs. 

**  Yes,  to  be  sure,"  he  said,  as  he  looked  at  the 
picture  ;  and  then  he  adde4,  in  soliloquy,  "  What  an 
apostolic  face  I  "  causing  us,  of  course,  to  laugh  ;  after 
which  he  told  the  Captain  there  was  no  ground  for 
bringing  an  accusation  against  us,  and  that,  in  fact, 
they  had  rendered  themselves  liable  to  be  sued.  The 
Procureur  then  asked  pardon  for  having  detained  us, 
and  pleaded  the  excited  state  of  the  country  as  an 
excuse,  whilst  the  Captain  in  turn  screened  himself 
behind  the  over-zealousness  of  one  of  his  subalterns. 
It  was  now  my  turn  to  be  gracious,  and  I  took  blame 
to  myself  (which  I  really  deserved)  for  not  having 
mentioned  to  the  station-master  before  I  started  what 
I  was  going  to  do,  for  then  all  would  have  gone 
smoothly  enough,  but  the  narrow  limits  of  my  intended 
distribution  caused  me,  I  suppose,  to  forget  it.  We 
were  then  asked  to  sign  a  protocol  to  be  kept  in  the 
archives,  giving  the  particulars  of  our  arrest,  saying  that 
two  Englishmen  had  passed  through  Perm,  that  one  of 
them  threw  a  bundle  of  publications  in  one  instance,  and 
in  another  handed  some,  from  the  train,  but  that  the 
publications  on  being  examined  proved  to  be  religious 
pamphlets,  bearing  titles  such  as  followed,  and  so  we 
parted  with  mutual  apologies  and  shaking  of  hands. 

One  of  my  abettors  present  was  greatly  disgusted 
with  "  these  Russians,"  as  he  called  them,  and  ex- 
pressed his  opinion  that  the  gendarme  who  sent  the 
telegram  would  **  get  it  hot,"  or  perhaps  be  dismissed. 
I  asked  in  the  evening  whether  the  informer  had  made 
his  appearance,  but  was  told  that  the  party  were  so 
ashamed  of  themselves  that  they  were  taking  care  to 
keep  out  of  my  way.     I  had,  however,  broken  the  law 


FROM  LONDON  TO  THE  URALS.  25 

in  throwing  printed  matter  from  a  train  in  motion,  a 
regulation  that  in  the  excited  state  of  the  country  was 
reasonable  enough,  but  which  I  did  not  know  to  be  an 
offence.  The  gendarme,  moreover,  who  received  the 
tracts  was  in  the  main  right,  for  the  Nihilists  are  very 
subtil,  and  not  only  put  seditious  leaflets  into  duly 
authorized  tracts  to  distribute,  but  I  have  heard  on  good 
authority  of  a  Bible  having  been  seen,  beginning  with 
Genesis  and  ending  with  Revelation,  but  filled  in  with 
— N  ihilistic  matter  !  The  telegram,  therefore,  of  the 
gendarme  sent  to  his  chief,  and  read  by  the  Captain  at 
Perm,  was  so  far  correct,  and  seemed  to  say  that  our 
books  should  be  examined  because  he  thought  they 
might  contain  proclamations,  whereas  in  sending  after 
us  he  seemed  to  have  muddled  his  grammar,  and  said 
that  the  tracts  distributed  did  contain  proclamations. 

The  matter  was  then  dismissed  from  my  mind  till 
we  returned  to  Europe,  and  found  that  first  the  Russian 
and  then  the  English  newspapers,  not  content  with  my 
arrest,  had  been  putting  me  into  prison,  one  of  them 
so  fast  as  to  declare  it  was  only  by  the  intercession  of 
the  Duchess  of  Edinburgh  that  I  was  released  I  Thus 
my  friends  might  well  congratulate  me,  as  they  did  on 
my  return,  at  having  been  liberated.  As  a  matter  of 
fact,  however,  though  twice  arrested  for  distributing 
tracts,  I  have  never  been  imprisoned,  and  in  this  case 
the  authorities  did  everything  in  their  power  to  repair 
the  damage.  Our  railway  tickets  were  allowed  to 
stand,  a  first  class  compartment  was  secured  for  us  and 
marked  "reserved,"  and  the  guards  paid  us  every 
attention.  Thus  we  had  a  ride  of  160  miles  free  of 
chaise,  as  well  as  the  pleasure  of  a  little  excitement, 
and  started  by  the  next  train,  once  more  to  attempt, 
and  this  time  successfully,  the  crossing  of  the  Urals.

EKATERINEBURG  is  the  railway  terminus  at 
which  the  traveller  arrives  in  passing  from 
Perm  into  Asia,  but  here  we  stayed  only  four-and- 
twenty  hours,  before  posting  to  Tiumen,  which 
we  reached  on  August  4th.  At  Tiumen  I  found  my 
books,  and  that  not  a  moment  too  soon,  for  by  a 
clerk's  mistake  they  were  shipped  for  Tomsk,  a  blunder 
which,  had  it  not  been  detected,  would  have  cost  us 
at  least  a  month's  delay.  Here  I  may  mention  that, 
before  starting  for  Central  Asia,  it  was  more  difficult 
than  when  going  to  Siberia,  to  form  a  correct  estimate 
as  to  how  many  publications  I  could  carry  and  properly 
dispose  of,  and  in  what  languages  and  dialects  they 
would  be  required.  The  committees  of  the  two  societies 
kindly  placed  at  my  disposal  such  a  number  of  their 
books  respectively  as  seemed  desirable,  and  practicable, 
and  I  wrote  to  the  Rev.  W.   Nicholson    my  faithful

ally,  who  has  always  been  so  ready  to  help  me,  in 
Petersburg,  to  get  ready  5,000  Scriptures,  10,000 
Russian  tracts,  1,000  copies  of  a  monthly  paper 
called  the  Russian  Workman,  and  an  illustrated  broad- 
sheet entitled  "The  Prodigal  Son."  These  were  to 
be  packed  in  strong  wooden  boxes,  iron-hooped  at  the 
ends,  and  corded ;  and  when  I  arrived  and  found  30 
of  them  awaiting  me,  to  say  nothing  of  personal 
baggage  and  provisions,  I  confess  to  feeling  a  little 
alarmed  at  the  burden  prepared  for  my  back.  The 
Scriptures  consisted  of  Bibles,  Old  Testaments,  New 
Testaments,  the  four  Gospels  (bound  together  and 
singly),  and  the  Book  of  Psalms.  They  were  printed 
in  Russian,  Sclavonic,  Hebrew,  Chinese,  Mongolian, 
Kirghese,  Persian,  Arabic,  Turkish,  Polish,  German, 
and  French,  and  these,  as  I  have  said,  I  was  able  to 
book  through  to  Tiumen,  where  I  hoped  to  deposit 
a  considerable  number  for  distribution  to  the  exiles. 

It  was  very  pleasant  in  this  town  to  renew  ac- 
quaintanceships formed  three  years  previously,  which 
I  did  first  with  an  English  family  named  Wardropper, 
and  then  with  Mr.  Ignatoff,  who  contracts  for  the 
carriage  by  water  of  the  exiles  to  Tomsk,  and 
of  soldiers  to  Semipolatinsk.  This  gentleman  so 
thoroughly  approved  of  the  object  that  led  me  to 
Siberia  in  1879,  that,  unasked,  he  took  my  luggage 
free  of  cost,  and  after  my  departure  gave  every  facility 
on  his  barges  for  distribution  of  my  books  to  the 
exiles  as  each  company  embarked.  Thus  the  Bibles 
and  tracts  I  had  left  behind  had  been  carefully  given 
out  under  supervision,  and  I  was  pleased  to  hear  that, 
when  my  stock  of  Scriptures  was  exhausted,  Mr. 
Ignatoff  had  sent,  at  his  own  expense,  for  200  more. 
Specimen  copies  of  the  books  and  tracts  had  been  sent 


2S  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

to  the  Governor-General,  as  well  as  to  the  Governor 
and  the  Archbishop  of  Tobolsk,  who  were  pleased 
with  the  work  and  with  the  books,  and  sanctioned 
their  distribution.  A  report  of  what  had  been  done 
was  subsequently  sent  to  them,  Mr.  Ignatoff  informed 
me.  He  was  able  to  tell  me  also  that  the  publications 
had  been  much  appreciated,  and  that  on  more  than 
one  occasion  the  exiles  had  drawn  up  a  written  form 
of  thanks  and  signed  their  names.  Many,  too,  had 
thanked  him  individually.  This  testimony  was  con- 
firmed by  the  officer  who  had  charge  of  the  prisoners 
between  Tiumen  and  Tomsk,  and  who  said  that  the 
books  I  left  to  remain  permanently  on  the  barges  for 
the  use  of  prisoners  were  still  there,  and  accessible  to 
them  without  having  to  be  asked  for.  He  mentioned, 
too,  incidentally,  how  little  sickness  there  had  been 
on  the  barges  that  season.  Eight  barges  had  carried 
6,000  prisoners  a  distance  of  nearly  2,000  miles.  Only 
2  (a  child  and  an  adult)  had  died  on  the  passage,  and 
only  20  had  been  delivered  invalided  at  Tomsk.  Yet 
another  testimony  pleasing  to  hear  was  that  of  Mr. 
Wardropper,  within  sight  of  whose  house  the  exiles  are 
shipped  by  thousands,  who  said  that  the  general  con- 
dition of  the  prisoners,  and  the  attention  bestowed  upon 
them,  had  greatly  improved  during  the  past  few  years. 
The  question  then  remained  as  to  what  could  be 
done  in  the  future  for  the  thousands  who  every 
summer  pass  through  Tiumen  to  be  scattered  over 
Siberia  ;  some  to  be  made  as  colonists  at  once,  and 
others  to  spend  first  their  terms  in  prison  or  at  the 
mines.  The  Bible  Society  had  not  yet  been  able  to 
establish  dep6ts  in  Siberia,  east  of  the  Urals,  other 
than  at  Ekaterineburg  and  Tomsk,*  and  although  a 

*  A  dep6t  has  since  been  established  at  Irkutsk. 


FROM  THE  URALS  TO  OMSK.  29 

Stray  copy  of  the  Scriptures  might  here  and  there  be 
found  with  the  merchants  in  large  towns,  yet  for  the 
mass  of  the  banished  it  might  be  said  that  copies  of 
the  Bible   were   unobtainable  even   by  those   willing 
to   buy   them.      It   must  have  been   no  small   boon, 
therefore,  during   the  preceding   seasons,    when,  after 
embarkation  of  the  convicts,,  at  the  close  of  a  religious 
service  before  they  left  Tiumen,  books  and  tracts  were 
handed  to  those  who  could   read :    and  it  was  easy 
to  understand  that,  in  many  cases,  the  New    Testa- 
ment thus  received  had  been  carried  to  some  distant 
izba  or  cabin,  to  form  the  library  of  the  household, 
or,  indeed,  the  only  copy  of  the  sacred  volume  in  the 
village.      Accordingly   it   was   determined   that  there 
should  be  left  for  distribution  at  and  from  Tiumen, 
between   3,000  and  4,000  copies   of  the   Scriptures, 
and    about   half  my   stock   of    other   publications,    a 
lai^e  proportion  of  which  was  to  be  given  as  before 
to  the  exiles  going  east  by  the  barges  ;  whilst  for  the 
7,000  who  are   annually  distributed  in  the   province 
of  Tobolsk,    an  invitation   was  to   be  given   to   the 
voUost  (or  district)  committees  to  purchase  the  books 
at  a  cheap  rate,  and  to  sell  them  still  cheaper  to  the 
exiles  living  free ;  and  this  on  the  principle  that  a  man 
values  a  purchase  more  than  a  gift. 

Of  course  we  were  not  so  Utopian  as  to  suppose 
that  none  of  these  would  be  put  to  a  perverted  use 
or  be  placed  in  the  hands  of  those  who  would  not  care 
for  them.  The  tracts,  some  have  said,  will  be  used 
for  cigarettes,  and  the  Bibles  be  sold  for  vodka  (or 
brandy),  which,in  some  cases,  would  be  quite  probable. 
It  would  be  a  rare  field  in  which  every  seed  came 
to  perfection.  Nevertheless  I  am  pleased  to  be  able 
to  say  that  of  the  scores  of  thousands  of  tracts  I  have 


30  RUSSIA:^  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

given  away  in  Russia,  I  do  not  remember  ever  to 
have  seen  one  torn  or  defaced.  Mr.  Ignatoft's  testi- 
mony was  similar  :  that  among  the  exiles  he  had 
never  seen  a  New  Testament  spoiled,  not  even  when 
sold  or  taken  to  the  dram  shop.  I  had  also  the 
independent  testimony  of  an  officer  over  soldiers  that 
guard  the  prisoners  at  Tiumen  and  Tobolsk,  and  who 
had  been  connected  with  the  transport  of  the  exiles  to 
Tomsk,  to  the  effect  that  when  at  Tobolsk  he  had 
observed  how  glad  the  prisoners  were  to  get  the 
books,  and  how  pleased  they  were  to  read  them. 
Moreover,  he  knew  no  instance  of  their  being  torn  ; 
but,  on  the  contrary,  he  had  known  cases  of  prisoners 
come  from  Tiumen,  who,  on  being  searched  at  Tomsk, 
were  found  to  possess  New  Testaments  hidden  about 
them,  which  they  were  allowed  to  keep.  That  the 
prisoners  may  sell  the  books  to  each  other,  or  the 
exiles  occasionally  to  those  willing  to  buy  them,  is, 
of  course,  possible  ;  but  this  surely  is  not  an  unmixed 
evil,  for  it  means  that  a  portion  of  Scripture  has  passed 
out  of  the  hands  of  one  who  did  not  care  for  it  into 
the  hands  of  one  who  does.  I  was,  therefore,  only 
too  thankful  to  leave  a  goodly  store  of  books  at 
Tiumen,  finding  my  friends  willing  to  do  with  them 
all  that  was  possible  and  lawful. 

I  was  able  at  Tiumen  to  get  a  few  more  introduc- 
tions for  the  south.  As  they  now  stand  in  my  journal, 
allocated  under  the  respective  towns  where  they  were 
to  be  presented,  they  amount  in  number  to  255  :  but 
this  includes  documents  of  all  sorts,  official  and  private ; 
letters  open  and  letters  sealed  ;  cards  "  to  introduce 
Mr.  So-and-So,"  and  cards  backed  with  miniature 
epistles.  Moreover,  they  extended  over  a  longer 
route  than  I  covered,  for  had  the  way  to  Central  Asia 


FROM  THE  URALS  TO  OMSK.  31 

been  blocked,  I  was  prepared  for  a  run  from  Peters- 
burg through  Finland,  and  then  to  Persia,  the  Tigris 
valley,  Armenia,  Constantinople,  Greece,  and  Italy. 
Another  thing  we  obtained  at  Tiumen  was  a  second 
vehicle  wherein  to  carry  the  books.  Mr.  Wardropper 
ordered  to  be  made  for  me  a  strong  telega  or  wago- 
nette (though  not  in  the  English  sense  of  the  word), 
which  answered  its  purpose  admirably.  We  obtained, 
too,  a  few  more  provisions,  but  I  found  I  had  made 
a  mistake  about  tinned  meat.  This  article  is  so  heavy 
that  I  had  deferred  its  purchase  as  long  as  possible 
on  account  of  the  inconvenience  and  expense  of  carry- 
ing it  as  passenger  s  luggage,  and  thinking  to  get  it 
at  Ekaterineburg  or  Tiumen ;  but  at  neither  town, 
however,  could  I  procure  cans  of  beef,  but  only 
relishes,  such  as  tinned  salmon  and  lobster,  or pdU  de 
foie  gras,  and  this  last  at  a  price  to  make  one's  hair 
stand  on  end. 

In  a  very  short  time  we  were  ready  to  leave  for 
Omsk ;  but  the  question  arose.  By  water  or  by  road  ? 
Mr.  Ignatoft's  steamer  was  not  to  start  for  some  days, 
and  I  was  therefore  inclined  to  post  with  horses.  An 
important  factor,  however,  in  my  calculations  was, 
'  Where  can  I  meet  General  Kolpakovsky  } '  the  new 
Governor-General  of  the  Steppe,  who  had  been  resident 
in  the  south  at  Vierny,  and  was  said  to  be  on  his  way 
to  Omsk,  his  future  residence,  but  making  official  inspec- 
tions en  route.  I  had  a  letter  for  him,  that  an  officer 
at  Moscow,  who  knew  the  country,  had  strictly 
counselled  me  on  no  account  to  fail  to  present,  in 
order  that  I  might  receive  the  proper  papers  where- 
with to  enter  Kuldja;  "for,"  said  he,  '*so  prejudiced 
are  the  officials  down  there,  that  an  autograph  letter 
from  the  Emperor  himself  will  not  gain  you  admission 


32  JRUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

to  Kuldja,  if  you  have  not  one  from  General  Kol- 
pakovsky."  Accordingly,  when  one  day  Mr.  Ignatoff 
called  on  us  to  say  that  the  Governor-General  had  left 
Vierny  only  the  day  before,  and  that,  travel  as  fast  as 
he  would,  he  could  not  reach  Omsk  before  the  date 
on  which  the  steamer  was  due,  I  determined  to  save 
the  shaking  of  my  bones  over  that  much  of  post-roads, 
and  to  glide  to  Omsk  on  the  Irtish.  This  Mr.  Ignatoff 
strongly  urged,  not,  as  will  hereafter  be  seen,  touting 
for  passengers,  nor  with  an  eye  to  business,  but  with 
desire  to  perform  a  generous  deed. 

Our  stay  being  thus  prolonged,  we  had  time  to 
visit  the  new  commercial  school,  built  at  the  cost  of 
Mr.  Padaruyeff,  the  mayor,  and  in  it  the  museum, 
where  was  a  good  number  of  specimens  of  butterflies, 
beetles,  bees,  and  moths,  collected  locally  by  Mr. 
Slovtsoff,  to  whom  I  had  an  introduction,  but  who 
happened  unfortunately  to  be  away.  We  saw  also  a 
good  deal  of  the  Wardroppers,  who  had  just  astonished 
the  natives  with  a  steamer  they  had  built,  of  200  tons 
displacement,  measuring  170  ft.  by  22  ft.,  a  hold  7  ft. 
6  in.  deep,  and  drawing  only  28  in.  of  water.* 

On  the  loth  of  August  we  were  to  leave  Tiumen, 
and  Mr.  Ignatoff  gave  a  dinner  in  my  honour,  placing 

*  She  had  compound  condensing  engines,  cylinder  steam  jacketed, 
and  fitted  with  Corliss  gear,  which  Mr.  Edward  Wardropper  had  seen 
in  England,  though  not  on  steamers,  and  which  he  had  adapted  to  that 
end.  The  high-pressure  cylinder  was  of  21  and  the  low-pressure  3& 
inches  in  diameter,  the  stroke  48  in.,  and  the  nominal  horse  power  80. 
All  the  working  parts  were  of  Bessemer  steel,  and  the  boilers  made  of 
Siemens*  steel,  worked  to  a  pressure  of  from  90  to  100  lbs.  The  engines 
had  been  made  at  the  Government  steel  factory,  500  miles  away,  at 
Perm,  but  otherwise  the  whole  was  built  in  Siberia,  where,  as  regards 
her  fittings  of  steel  and  Corliss  gear,  she  was  regarded  as  a  novelty, 
whilst  owner  and  builders  alike  were  pleased  that  she  could  tug  against 
stream  in  2  lighters,  16  tons  to  each  horse  power. 


FROM  THE  URALS  TO  OMSK.  33 

me  at  the  head  of  the  table,*  and  Mr.  Sevier  opposite; 
and  when,  later  on,  I  went  to  the  ticket  office,  there 
was  handed  to  me  a  free  pass  securing,  as  far  as  the 
steamer  could  go,  a  first-class  cabin  with  three  berths, 
free  transport  of  my  two  vehicles  and  the  whole  of  my 
baggage!  This  I  thought  a  proof  of  Mr.  Ignatoff' s 
sympathy  with  my  work,  and  the  more  observable 
because  I  was  told  that  he  was  Russian  to  the  back- 
bone, and  hated  foreigners ;  moreover,  that  he  would 
probably  rather  have  seen  my  work  in  the  hands  of  his 
own  countrymen,  but  that  as  they  did  not  do  it,  and  I 
did,  he  rose  above  his  prejudices  and  acted  in  the 
handsome  manner  I  have  described. 

We  left  Tiumen  in  the  small  steamer  Kapitan, 
that  carried  us  60  miles  down  the  shallow  Tura 
to  its  confluence  with  the  Tobol,  where  we  arrived 
on  the  morning  of  the  following  day.  We  were 
then  transhipped  into  the  SerapoleiSy  a  large,  con- 
venient, and  comfortable  boat.  During  the  process  of 
shifting,  I  observed  a  man  looking  steadily  at  me, 
whom  I  recognized  as  the  captain  of  the  Beljetchenkoy 
in  which  I  made  the  voyage  three  years  previously 
from  Tobolsk  to  Tomsk.  I  was  glad  to  find  he  had 
not  forgotten  **  Mr.  Missionary,"  as  he  then  called  me. 
I  recognized  also,  among  the  passengers,  the  French 
master  at  the  Gymnase,  whom  I  had  met  on  my  previous 
visit  to  Tobolsk. 

The  holidays  were  drawing  to  a  close,  and  several 
masters  and  more  scholars  were  returning  for  the  open* 
ing  term.  This  gave  me  an  opportunity,  which  I 
embraced  on  the  morrow,  to  sell  some  Bibles  and  tracts.

VOL.    I.  3 


34  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

Opening  a  couple  of  boxes  on  deck,  I  was  speedily- 
surrounded  with  purchasers  of  all  classes,  and  among 
them  several  ladies  and  ardent  schoolboys.  One 
little  fellow  bought  of  me  almost  wholesale,  and  I  am 
afraid  nearly  emptied  his  pockets.  The  masters  of  the 
gymnase  bought  copies  in  French  and  German,  as  did 
some  of  the  scholars,  whilst  the  old-fashioned  orthodox 
took  them  in  Sclavonic.  There  was  a  demand,  too,  for 
Polish  copies.  The  light  in  which  my  purchasers  re- 
garded me  evidently  varied  widely.  Some  understood 
that  I  was  conducting  a  labour  of  love,  but  others 
treated  me  as  a  merchant  pure  and  simple.  One 
matter-of-fact  old  lady,  of  commercial  principles  truly 
Russian,  caused  much  amusement  to  the  bystanders 
by  trying  to  beat  me  down.  Having  fixed  upon  her 
book,  she  asked  the  price.  "  Twenty-five  kopecks,"  I 
replied.  "  But  can't  you  take  twenty  ? "  she  said ; 
and,  heedless  of  the  laughter  of  the  crowd,  went  on 
haggling,  till  I,  more  anxious  as  to  her  future  possession 
of  the  book  than  the  sum  she  paid,  allowed  her  to 
have  it  at  her  own  price.  When  the  sales  began  to 
grow  less  brisk,  and  the  poorer  passengers  saw  what 
their  richer  friends  had  bought,  they  came  asking  for  the 
books  at  reduced  prices,  and  this  I  allowed  in  cases  that 
appeared  genuine.  This  caused  the  ship's  stoker,  who 
had  bought  at  catalogue  price,  to  inquire  why  others 
were  served  cheaper  than  he  ;  and  when  we  said, 
"  Because  they  are  poor,"  he  wished  to  know  what 
means  we  had  of  divining  the  contents  of  their  purses. 
Thus,  on  the  whole,  I  did  a  capital  morning's  trade, 
and  in  the  afternoon  the  boat  arrived  at  Tobolsk.  Here 
I  had  five  things  to  do :  to  visit  the  Governor ;  to 
present  an  introductory  letter  ;'to  visit  an  exile's  tomb, 
with  a  view  to  getting  it  sketched  ;  to  pay  my  respects 


FROM  THE  URALS  TO  OMSK.  35 

to  the  Archbishop ;  and  to  look  at  a  collection  of  coins 
— and  all  this  in  the  two  hours  during  which  the  steamer 
would  wait !  I  had  communicated  with  the  Governor, 
reminding  him  that  I  had  received  no  account  of  the 
books  I  left  with  him  on  my  last  visit,  to  be  distributed 
in  the  hospitals,  prisons,  schools,  and  public  institutions 
of  his  province,  and  asking  that  I  might  be  so  favoured, 
if  possible,  on  my  expected  arrival.  As  we  drew  near 
the  city,  his  Excellency  was  steaming  about  on  a 
pleasure  trip,  with  band  playing  and  colours  flying  ;  but 
seeing  our  boat  arriving,  and  knowing,  as  he  said,  I  was 
on  board,  he  caused  his  craft  to  turn  back  and  come 
alongside  to  welcome  me.  The  police-master  then 
handed  me  a  detailed  report  in  writing,  and  the 
Governor  thanked  me  for  the  books  he  had  had  to 
distribute,  adding  that  he  should  be  glad  to  give  a  few 
more,  especially  in  some  of  the  country  schools.  He 
then  offered  to  be  of  any  use  in  his  province  that  he 
could,  put  me  into  the  hands  of  some  of  his  officials 
to  help  me  to  what  I  wanted  in  the  town,  and  steamed 
away. 

This  occupied  about  15  or  20  minutes,  and  we 
then  drove  quickly,  under  the  charge  of  the  police- 
master,  to  Madame  Znamensky*s,  who,  knowing  my 
haste,  accompanied  me  at  once  to  the  cemetery  on  the 
heights  in  the  outskirts  of  the  town.  Here  were 
buried  Wolff  and  Mouravieff,  two  celebrated  Decem- 
brists, political  exiles  who  took  part  in  the  insurrection 
in  December,  1825,  and  I  had  been  asked  by  a  relative 
of  the  latter  to  visit,  if  possible,  his  grave,  and  look 
to  its  condition.  Thanks  to  the  care  of  Madame 
Znamensky,  who  had  been  governess  to  the  exiled 
nobleman's  daughters,  the  tomb  was  in  good  condition, 
save  only  that  the  iron  railings  were  broken,  and  these 


36  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

could  not  be  mended,  because  there  was  no  foundry  in 
the  district.  I  asked  as  to  the  possibility  of  getting 
a  photograph  of  the  spot,  had  the  Russian  epitaph 
copied  into  my  note-book,  and  then,  without  loss  of 
time,  hastened  away. 

We  presented  ourselves  next  at  the  palace  of  the 
Archbishop,  whose  good-will  I  was  anxious  to  gain 
with  reference  to  the  books  I  had  left  to  be  distributed 
at  Tiumen  ;  for,  although  his  Eminence  might  not  have 
absolute  power  to  forbid  their  dissemination,  he  might 
put  difficulties  in  the  way,  and  it  was  in  any  case  better 
that  we  should  have  his  benediction.  Having  sent  in 
my  card,  we  were  shown  into  a  chamber  spacious  and 
lofty,  with  shrubs  and  flowers  in  the  windows,  remind- 
ing me,  in  one  respect  at  least,  of  Lambeth  Palace,  in 
that  the  walls  were  hung  with  portraits  of  Archbishops 
for  many  generations,  though  the  number  at  Tobolsk 
was  much  fewer,  and  the  pictures  mere  daubs  compared 
with  some  of  the  portraits  at  Lambeth.  I  learned  that 
the  present  Archbishop  of  Tobolsk  had  only  recently 
been  appointed,  and  that  it  was  not  he  who  ap- 
proved my  books  and  tracts  as  left  before.  I  had, 
therefore,  to  explain  the  object  and  character  of  my 
mission,  and  told  him  of  the  books  I  had  left  for  distri- 
bution. He  seemed  at  first  to  be  somewhat  suspicious 
that  we  were  actuated  by  sectarian  motives,  but  ulti- 
mately expressed  his  pleasure  at  what  we  were  doing, 
and  wished  us  God-speed ! 

We  then  drove  to  the  park  close  by  to  peep  at 
Siberia's  one  monument — that  of  Yermak,  the  robber 
chief  who  added  Siberia  to  the  Russian  Empire.  The 
present  monument  is  a  stone  column  standing  in  a 
garden.  The  former  one  consisted  of  a  wooden  figure, 
to  which  the  Tatars  set  fire  out  of  revenge ;  but  the

remains  of  it  are  still  preserved  in  a  shed  within  the 
grounds. 

We  afterwards  descended  the  hill  to  look  at  a  private 
collection  of  copper  coins  and  medals,  the  value  of 
which,  however,  we  thought  exaggerated,  and  hurried 
on  to  the  boat  to  find  that  the  captain  had  kindly  been 
waiting  only  for  us. 

Thus  far  my  journey  from  London  had  been  over 
old  ground,  save  that  in  1879  I  followed  the  post-road 
from  Tiumen  to  Tobolsk.  I  was  now  to  wander  into 
fresh  fields,  and  make  way  up  the  Irtish  to  Omsk,  a 
voyage  that  occupied  five  days.  The  regular  service 
of  steamers  running  fortnightly,  or  thereabouts,  from 
Tiumen  to  Omsk,  and  (when  the  water  is  sufficient) 
to  Semipolatinsk,*  had  been  started  about  two  years 
only,  the  chief  demand  for  it  being  the  annual  transport 
of  young  soldiers  on  their  way  to  Turkistan.  They 
travel  on  a  large  barge  tugged  astern  of  the  passenger 
steamer,  both  proceeding  slowly,  and  helping  to  make 
a  dull  journey  somewhat  tedious. 

*  The  following  is  a  table  of  stations  between  Tiumen  and  Semipola- 
tinsk, with  approximate  distances  between,  together  with  the  fares  for 
first,  second,  and  third-class  passengers  and  baggage : —

38  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

The  banks  of  the  river  possess  no  beauty,  and  little 
interest.  When  Yermak  pushed  his  way  into  Siberia 
at  the  close  of  the  sixteenth  century,  he  took  a  small 
fortress  on  the  banks  of  the  Irtish  called  Sibir,  the 
ruins  of  which  I  was  under  the  impression  were  still 
to  be  seen ;  *  but  in  answer  to  my  inquiries  it  was  said 
to  be  unknown,  as  also  the  spot  where  Yermak  fell 
into  the  Irtish  and  was  drowned.  We  passed  very 
few  habitations,  and  not  many  cattle.  On  the  second 
day  after  leaving  Tobolsk  we  arrived  at  Ust-Ishim,  a 
selOy  or  church  village,  with  only  14  Russian  houses, 
but  with  a  large  number  of  Tatar  habitations.  It 
derives  what  little  importance  it  has  from  being  the 
centre  of  the  corn  trade  for  the  surrounding  district, 
the  grain  being  gathered  there  for  the  market  at 
Tobolsk.  We  stopped,  of  course,  at  wooding  stations, 
the  steamer  burning  6  cubic  fathoms,  or  1,296  cubic 
feet,  of  logs  per  day,  at  a  cost  on  the  river's  bank  of 
5^.  per  fathom.  In  Omsk  the  cubic  fathom  costs  7s.  ; 
and  in  Petersburg  50J. 

These  delays  for  taking  fuel  were  not  altogether 
unwelcome,  because  they  allowed  of  our  going  on 
shore  to  look  at  the  villages  and  to  see  what  the 
peasantry  had  to  offer  in  the  way  of  raspberries  and 
other  fruits,  cucumbers  and  curdled  milk,  called  prosto- 
kvaska.  We  were  able  to  exchange  commodities  in 
offering  them  Scriptures  and  tracts,  which  usually 
they  took  readily.  At  a  certain  church  village  we 
called  and  sold  books  to  the  priest,  who  was  glad  to 
purchase — ^though  at  Ust-Ishim,  where  I  sent  parcels  of

tracts  to  three  ecclesiastics  on  the  bank,  one  of  them, 
I  suppose  from  fear  or  misunderstanding,  declined  to 
accept  them.  We  sold  several  publications  also  at  a 
cheap  rate  to  the  officer  on  the  soldiers'  barge,  for 
distribution  among  the  men.  On  the  1 5th- 1 6th  of 
August,  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  we  reached  Tara, 
a  town  of  6,000  inhabitants,  and  460  miles  from 
Tobolsk.  I  remembered  the  name  of  this  place, 
because  I  had  read  of  its  prison,  from  which  the  exile 
Pietrovski  escaped,  made  his  way  over  the  Urals  to 
Archangel,  and  thence  to  Western  Europe.  I  myself 
was  awaked  from  my  slumbers  there,  to  learn  that  the 
police-master  of  Tara  had  come  on  board  and  asked 
for  me.  I  dressed  of  course  in  haste,  with  the  chance 
possibly  of  being  again  arrested  and  taken  back.  But 
all  was  right  this  time,  the  Governor  at  Tobolsk  having 
telegraphed  to  the  police-master  to  present  himself  on 
my  arrival,  and  inquire  if  there  was  aught  I  required. 

Everything,  however,  was  going  smoothly,  if  not 
rapidly,  enough.  My  time  was  occupied  in  reading 
books  of  the  region  whither  we  were  going,  and  the 
steward  provided  an  excellent  table.  Thus  our  dinner 
on  the  day  after  leaving  Tobolsk  consisted  of,  first, 
clear  soup  made  of  sterlet — a  fish  at  largest  about 
two  feet  long,  and  weighing  10  lbs.,  with  pale  pink 
flesh  like  that  of  a  Loch  Leven  trout,  remarkably  tender, 
and  almost  tasteless  I  thought ;  but  the  flavour  of 
which  is  so  highly  esteemed  in  Petersburg,  that  the 
soup  there  costs  3^.  a  plate.  The  second  course — 
boiled  nelnuiy  a  bigger  fish  than  the  preceding,  with 
firm,  white  flesh,  and,  as  I  thought,  very  good.  The 
third  course  consisted  of  tetierka,  and  a  good,  dry- 
tasting  game  the  Russians  call  glukhar,  or  capercailzie. 
The  fourth  course  was  of  prostokvasha^  made  of  sour 


40  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

milk  and  cream.  Such  a  dinner  ordered  a  la  carte  costs 
from  i^.  6^.  to  2s.  ;  and  I  heard  that  at  Tara  other 
provisions  were  equally  cheap.* 

I  need  hardly  say  that  among  our  fellow-passengers 
were  no  tourists.  Travellers  for  pleasure  are  rare 
indeed  in  Siberia  and  Turkistan.  We  met  with  only 
two  in  all  Central  Asia.  But  there  were  upper-form 
**  gymnasts "  returning  to  school  at  Omsk,  who  on 
Sunday  evening  hymned  to  me  on  deck  some  Russian 
Church  music,  whilst  I  in  turn  sang  them  in  Latin  the 
•'  Agnus  Dei "  in  Mozart's  '*  First  Mass."  So,  too, 
there  was  a  Russian  merchant  and  his  wife,  who  spoke 
English,  and  who,  it  was  easy  to  see,  had  travelled. 
They  were  going  home  to  their  children  at  Tara, 
having,  since  they  left  them,  accomplished  the  circuit 
of  the  world.  The  husband's  business  establishments 
were  at  Hankow  and  Foochow,  to  which  places  the 
lady  had  twice  crossed  the  Mongolian  desert  from  her 
father's  house  in  Kiakhta;  but  this  time  they  had 
preferred  crossing  the  two  oceans,  America,  and  Europe, 
instead  of  returning  westwards  through  Siberia.  We 
became  very  good  travelling  friends,  and  as  they  left 
us  at  Tara,  they  gave  me  a  cordial  invitation,  should  I 
come  near  them  in  China,  **just  to  look  in,"  which 
I  expressed  myself  forward  to  do. 

Thus  we  lost  at  this  second  station  two  pleasant 
passengers,  but  we  gained  other  two ;  for  there  came 
on  board  a  lady  and  her  daughter,  who  spoke  excellent

French.  They  were  accompanied  by  two  gentlemen 
who  appeared  to  be  "in  attendance,"  which  was 
explained  when  I  discovered  that  the  lady  was  the 
wife  of  the  Governor  of  Akmoh'nsk,  who  for  the  time 
being  was  acting  for  the  Governor-General.  The  fact 
that  I  had  a  letter  for  her  husband  was  of  course  an 
introduction,  and  when,  after  passing  the  third  station, 
Kartashevo,  we  arrived  on  the  1 7th  at  Omsk,  I  was 
introduced  on  the  landing-stage  to  the  Governor,  and 
invited  to  dinner  on  the  following  day.

"Russian  Central  Asia"  defined. — Its  dimensions,  boundaries,  and 
divisions. — The  government  general  of  the  Steppe  :  its  dimensions, 
hydrography,  surface,  and  vegetation  ;  its  population  and  commu-

BY  **  Russian  Central  Asia,"  as  read  in  the  title  of 
this  book,  is  meant  the  Tsar  s  dominions  lying 
between  the  Oxus  and  the  Irtish,  and  between  Omsk 
and  Samarkand.  This  territory  measures  from  west 
to  east  1,250  miles,  or  the  distance  from  London  to 
Petersburg,  and  from  north  to  south  1,100  miles,  or 
the  distance  from  Petersburg  to  the  Crimea.*     On  the

north  it  is  bounded  by  the  government  of  Tobolsk,  on 
the  west  by  one  of  the  Ural  provinces,  the  Sea  of  Aral, 
and  Khiva  ;  on  the  east  by  the  government  of  Tomsk 
and  what  was  Sungaria;  and  on  the  south  by  Bokhara 
and  Chinese  Turkistan.  Russian  Central  Asia  has  a 
population  of  nearly  four  millions,  or  five  to  the  square 
mile.  For  administrative  purposes  it  is  divided  into 
the  governments  general  or  vice-royalties  of  Turkistan 
and  the  Steppe.* 

The  general  government  of  the  Steppe  forms  the 
eastern  portion  of  Russian  Central  Asia,  and  the 
boundaries  of  the  two  on  the  north  and  east  coincide  ; 
whilst  the  vice-royalty  has  on  its  west  the  province 
of  Togai,  and,  on  the  south,  Russian  and  Chinese 
Turkistan.  Its  extreme  length  from  Omsk  to  the 
Thian-Shan  mountains  is  1,000  miles,  and  its  extreme 
width  on  the  49th  parallel  900  miles,  with  an  area  of 
538,167  square  miles — that  is,  as  large  as  France, 
Prussia,  Spain,  and  Portugal.  Its  entire  population 
is  1,549,383,  or  3  to  the  square  mile.  In  the  north 
the  plains  do  not  rise  to  a  thousand  feet,  though  there 
is  a  range  of  hills  attaining  to  that  height,  com- 
mencing 160  miles  west  of  the  town  of  Semipolatinsk, 
and  running  across  the  territory  in  a  north-westerly 
direction.  Further  south,  on  the  49th  parallel,  stretch 
westward  across  the  vice-royalty  from  the  Chingiz- 
Tau,  the   Suk-bash-Tau   mountains,  less   than    5,000 

*  Russia  has  possessions  in  Asia  south  of  the  Caucasus  and  east  of 
the  Caspian,  including  Merv;  also  part  of  the  provinces  of  Penn, 
Orenburg,  and  Turgai  extend  east  of  the  Urals ;  but  all  these  posses- 
sions are  governed  from  European  centres,  so  that,  for  administrative 
purposes,  Siberia  and  what  I  have  called  Russian  Central  Asia  make 
up  the  whole  of  Asiatic  Russia.  I  did  not  enter  Yakutsk  in  1879 ;  but 
with  this  exception  I  have  travelled  in  all  the  other  provinces,  so  that 
"  Through  Siberia  "  and  the  present  work  describe  with  more  or  less 
completeness  the  whole.

feet  high.  In  the  western  portion  of  the  range  they 
do  not  exceed  i,ooo  feet,  and  form  the  watershed  of 
several  streams  running  south  into  the  Sari-Su.  South 
of  the  Suk-bash-Tau  range  is  the  basin  of  the  Balkhash, 
that,  with  the  valley  of  the  Hi,  has  an  altitude  of  less 
than  i,ooo  feet,  though  on  the  north  of  the  Hi  about 
Kopal  are  mountains  attaining  to  nearly  5,000  feet, 
whilst  on  the  south,  behind  Vierny,  the  Trans- Hian 
or  southern  Ala-Tau  range  far  exceeds  that  height. 

The  principal  rivers  in  the  vice-royalty  are  the  Irtish 
and  Ishim,  flowing  into  the  Obi,  and  seven  rivers,  of 
which  the  Hi  is  the  most  considerable,  flowing  into  the 
Balkhash.  Others,  notably  the  Sari-Su,  the  Chu,  and 
the  Nura,  lose  themselves  in  the  Steppe,  or  some  of  its 
small  lakes.  Of  these  lakes  there  are  several  in  the 
plains,  such  as  Lake  Dengiz,  into  which  flows  the  Nura, 
but  none  of  them  are  worth  naming  in  comparison 
with  the  Balkhash.  In  the  mountains  are  lakes  Zaisan, 
Ala-Kul,  and  the  famous  Issik-Kul  at  an  altitude  of 
5,300  feet  above  the  sea.  In  the  climate  of  the  Steppe 
is  experienced  every  degree  of  temperature  between 
—  52*42,  the  greatest  cold  in  February,  1879,  at  Omsk 
in  the  north,  and  +  99*5  of  heat  in  the  south  at  Vierny. 

The  general  government  or  vice-royalty  of  the 
Steppe  is  divided  into  the  governments  or  provinces  of 
Akmolinsk,  Semipolatinsk,  and  Semirechia,  of  which 
the  surface  consists  mainly  of  mountains,  deserts,  and 
steppes.  In  the  north  the  steppes  afford  abundant 
pasturage  for  cattle  ;  to  the  west  and  south  of  the 
Balkhash  are  a  few  patches  of  sandy  desert ;  and 
in  the  south  and  south-east  are  the  mountains.  For 
the  most  part  the  territory  is  poorly  wooded.  A 
dendrological  map  of  Akmolinsk  and  Semipolatinsk 
shows  a  narrow  belt  of  deciduous  trees,  about  70  miles 


THE  STEPPE  AND  THE  PROVINCE  OF  AKMOLINSK.  45 

in  width,  stretching  across  the  territory  west  of  Omsk, 
and  a  small  area  of  a  like  character  about  the  town  of 
Akmolinsk,  Likewise  to  the  north  of  the  town  of 
Semipolatinsk  is  a  forest  of  conifers  about  100  miles 
square,  and  a  few  small  forests  of  this  character  are 
met  with  south  of  Petropavlovsk  ;  but  when  comparing 
these  with  the  immense  belt,  400  miles  wide,  of  coni- 
ferous trees  about  the  afifluents  of  the  Obi,  or  even  the 
lesser  deciduous  forests  between  Tobolsk  and  Omsk, 
the  northern  part  of  the  general  government  of  the 
Steppe  may  be  called  bare  of  trees  *  The  character  of 
the  vegetation  of  course  varies  considerably.  As  we 
approached  Omsk  we  were  thankful  for  raspberries, 
rather  sour  currants,  and  other  berries ;  but  at  Vierny 
we  feasted  on  luscious  melons,  grapes,  and  nectarines. 
So  again,  about  Omsk,  the  people  ate  black  rye  bread  ; 
at  Vierny  it  was  as  easy,  or  easier,  to  get  wheaten 
bread ;  whilst,  further  west,  rye  bread  can  with  difificulty 
be  procured  at  all. 

The  vice-royalty  is  peopled  by  a  comparatively 
small  number  of  Russian  soldiers,  Cossacks,  and 
colonists  in  the  towns  and  along  the  principal  high- 
ways ;  but  all  over  the  province  are  the  nomad  Kir- 
ghese  and  Kazaks ;  Kara-Kirghese  in  the  mountains, 
and  Kazaks  in  the  plains,  though  both  are  usually 
spoken  of  as  Kirghese.  The  chief  towns  besides 
Omsk — where  lives  the  Governor-General — are  Akmo- 
linsk  and  Semipolatinsk,  capitals  of  the  governments 
of  the  same  names,  and  Vierny,  the  capital  of  Semire- 

♦  According  to  the  report  of  the  officers  of  woods  and  forests,  the 
forest  area  of  Akmolinsk  extends  to  241,577  square  miles,  and  of 
SemipoLatinsk  to  332,880  square  miles,  to  which  should  be  added  forests 
belonging  to  stations  and  military  districts ;  to  Akmolinsk  97,085  square 
miles,  and  Semipolatinsk  67,578  square  miles,  giving  a  total  in  the  two 
northern  provinces  of  the  Steppe  of  744,746  square  miles.

chia.     Each  government  is  divided  into  uyezds,  each 
of  which  has  also  its  capital  town. 

With  regard  to  communications,  the  Irtish  is  navi- 
gable for  steamers  in  spring.  There  is  also  a  post 
carriage-road  and  telegraphic  communication  from 
Orenburg,  skirting  the  northern  boundary  of  the  vice- 
royalty  to  Omsk,  and  then  turning  south,  following 
the  river  as  far  as  Semipolatinsk,  after  which,  passing 
through  Sergiopol  to  Kopal,  it  makes  a  curve  in  a 
south-westerly  direction  to  Vierny,  and  continues  into 
Turkistan.  * 

Having  thus  briefly  sketched  the  general  govern- 
ment of  the  Steppe,  I  proceed  to  treat  of  Akmolinsk, 
the  largest  of  its  three  governments.  When  penning 
my  **  Through  Siberia,*'  I  wrote  :  **  Western  Siberia  is 
divided  into  four  provinces — namely,  Tobolsk,  Tomsk, 
Akmolinsk,  and  Semipolatinsk,"  which  was  then  true, 
but  territorial  arrangements  have  since  changed  ; 
Siberia  is  pushed  farther  to  the  east,  and  the  two 
provinces  of  Akmolinsk  and  Semipolatinsk  were  cut 
off  in  1882  to  make,  with  Semirechia,  the  general 
government  of  the  Steppe. 

Akmolinsk  is  bounded  on  the  north,  west,  and  east  by 
the  provinces  of  Tobolsk,  Turgai,  and  Semipolatinsk, 
and  on  the  south  by  Turkistan  and  Lake  Balkhash, 
Its  length  extends  to  700  miles,  or  the  distance  from 

Paris  to  Rome,  its  breadth  to  330  miles,  and  its  area 

•  This  main  road  is  joined  on  the  east  and  south  by  five  carriage- 
roads  from  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  Mariady,  Lepsinsk,  Kuldja,  and  Lake 
Issik-Kul,  but  it  gives  off  only  one  to  the  west,  from  Pavlodar  to  the 
Orenburg  road  at  Petropavlovsk.  Besides  the  carriage-roads  there  is 
a  great  caravan  route,  that,  entering  the  territory  from  the  south-west, 
skirts  the  bed  of  the  Sari-Su  for  300  miles,  and  branches  off  on  the  right 
to  Akmolinsk,  and  on  the  left  to  Atbasar ;  whilst  there  are  several  less 
important  roads  for  caravan  traffic  from  the  south  that  strike  at  some 
half-dozen  points  the  Orenburg  route. 


THE  STEPPE  AND  THE  PROVINCE  OF  AKMOLINSK.  47 

IS  210,961  square  miles — that  is,  the  size  of  France, 
which,  with  a  population  in  1880  of  459,319,  gives  an 
average  of  13  J  persons  to  the  square  mile. 

In  the  extreme  north  of  the  province,  about  Petro- 
pavlovsk,  the  surface  is  chiefly  of  undulating  chernozoniy 
or  black  earth,  intersected  by  deep  hollows,  and 
traversed  by  ranges  of  hills  gently  inclined  towards  the 
north,  but  abruptly  scarped  towards  the  south.  These 
hills  do  not  rise  to  an  altitude  of  1,000  feet  until  we 
come  to  the  northern  bank  of  the  I  shim,  along  which 
runs  a  higher  belt  60  miles  in  width.  South  of  the 
river  the  surface  is  again  depressed  as  far  as  to  the 
Suk-bash-Tau,  where,  for  a  small  area,  the  east  of  the 
province  rises  in  some  places  to  5,000  feet.  Still  further 
south,  in  the  east  are  hills  rising  to  1,000  feet,  but  in 
the  west  the  surface  is  depressed  and  partly  occupied 
by  the  GolodnayUy  or  Hungry  steppe,  whilst  north  of 
this  is  a  desert  of  sand  called  Peski-Muyun-Kum, 
covering  an  area  of  2,000  square  miles,  or  about  the 
size  of  Northumberland. 

The  principal  river  in  the  north  is  the  I  shim,  an 
affluent  of  the  Irtish,  which  latter  skirts  the  north- 
west comer  of  the  province.  The  I  shim  rises  about 
80  miles  south-east  of  the  town  of  Akmolinsk, 
or  the  **  white  tomb/'  as  Ak-moli  signifies  in  the 
Tatar  tongue.  Flowing  westwards  for  160  miles,  the 
I  shim  receives  several  tributaries  on  its  right  bank,  but 
only  one  on  its  left,  and  at  length  forms  a  junction 
with  the  Atbasar,  that  gives  its  name  to  a  small  town 
at  the  confluence.  About  80  miles  west  of  this  town 
the  I  shim  meets  a  range  of  hills  separating  Akmolinsk 
from  the  neighbouring  province,  and  which  diverts  its 
course  northwards  300  miles,  to  Petropavlovsk,  beyond 
which  it  passes  on  260  miles  further  to  the  Irtish. 


RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 


Of  a  different  character  from  the  I  shim  are  the 
streams  in  the  south  of  the  province,  for  all  of  them 
may  be  said  to  be  abortions,  since  they  fail  to 
reach  the  ocean  or  any  great  body  of  water  like  the 
Sea  of  Aral,  into  which  some  geographers  assert  they 
once  ran.  Thus  the  Sari-Su  rises  200  miles  south  of 
Akmolinsk,  and,  running  in  a  south-westerly  direction, 
receives  many  afifluents  from  the  north,  but  none 
from  the  souths  For  the  last  1 50  miles  of  its  sluggish 
course  it  forms  the  boundary  of  the  south-west  corner

attaining  to  the  Syr  or  the  Aral.  The  Nura,  for 
instance,  runs  through  a  closed  basin,  having  for  a 
central  lake  a  sheet  of  water  of  small  dimensions, 
bearing  the  name  of  "  Denghiz."  or  Sea,  which  may 
perchance  testify  to  its  having  covered  a  larger  area 
at  some  former  period. 

The  climate  of  the  province  is  decidedly  cold,  as 
we  were  reminded  by  some  officers  travelling  from 
the  south,  who  met  us  near  the  Irtish,  and  who  ran 
into  the  post-house  to  put  on  underclothing,  and 
exclaimed  that  they  were  approaching  Siberia !  At 
Omsk,  in  1879,  the  ice  of  the  river  did  not  break 
up  till  April  1 2th,*  and  froze  again  on  October  28th, 
and  the  I  shim  at  Akmolinsk  and  Petropavlovsk  was 
open  only  from  April  6th  to  October  26th,  and  April 
3rd  to  October  28th  respectively.  Again,  at  Omsk 
the  temperature  ranged  in  the  same  year  between  a 
minimum  in  December  of  —43*6.  and  a  maxunum  in 
July  of  -|-I02*20;  whilst  at  Akmolinsk  the  thermometer 
sunk  lower  in  December,  namely,  to  —50*3,  and  rose 
in  August  only  to  +977.t 

The  province  is  divided  into  the  uyezds  of  Akmo- 
linsk, Atbasarsk,  Kokchetovsk,  Petropavlovsk,  and 
Omsk,  of  which  the  populations  may  be  grouped  into 
120,000  settlers,  and  340,000  nomads,  the  former 
occupying  1 1 ,000,  and  the  latter  no  less  than  200,000 
square  miles,  or  an  area  the  size  of  Spain.  The 
density  of  population  varies  considerably  in  the  different 
uyezds,  as  does  the  proportion  of  nomads  to  settlers  ; 
for  whereas  in  Omsk  there  are  more  settlers  than 
nomads,  and  in  Petropavlovsk  they  are  about  equal, 
in  Kokchetovsk  the   nomads  double  in   number   the

The  minerals  of  the  province  are  coal,  copper,  gold, 
and  salt.  There  is  a  coal  mine  in  the  valley  of  the 
Nura,  near  the  source  of  the  Sokur,  and  some  few 
other  mines  about  the  sources  of  the  Sari-Su.*  With 
regard  to  agriculture,  the  Russians  cultivate  rye,  wheat, 
oats,  barley,  buckwheat,  a  few  other  kinds  of  corn,  and 
potatoes.  The  total  quantity  of  seed  sown  throughout 
the  province  in  1880  amounted  to  31,066  quarters,  which 
yielded  148,845,  being  in  the  proportion  of  i  to  47,  or 
nearly  a  fivefold  harvest.t  This  agricultural  produce, 
however,    would    not   suffice    to ,  supply    the    Russian 

♦  In  1880  the  quantity  obtained  of  coal  was  19,772  tons,  of  copper 
2,740  tons,  and  of  gold  62  lbs.  (avoirdupois),  which,  as  compared  with 
the  previous  year,  represented  an  increase  of  3,715  tons  in  coal,  and 
gold  28  lbs.,  but  the  copper  a  decrease  of  1,240  tons. 

t  A  comparison  of  the  preceding  10  years  shows  the  ratio  between 
sowing  and  reaping  to  have  been  lowest  in  1879,  ^  *o  2*6;  and 
highest  in  1876,  i  to  7*2  ;  the  average  of  the  ten  years  being  4*7.  It 
may  also  be  observed  that  whilst,  in  1880,  the  uyezd  of  Atbasar  yielded 
a  tenfold,  and  Akmolinsk  nearly  a  ninefold,  Omsk  barely  attained  to  a 
fourfold  harvest.  The  following  shows  the  number  of  quarters  of  various 
products  sown  and  reaped  throughout  the  province  in  1880  : —

population  alone  of  the  province,  to  say  nothing  of  the 
Kirghese;  but  it  so  happens  that  whilst  in  Akmolinsk 
and  Semipolatinsk  there  are  only  two  uyezds  that 
supply  more  than  the  computed  requirements  of  the 
population,  there  are  in  the  neighbouring  governments 
of  Tobolsk  and  Tomsk  only  two  uyezds  that  supply 
less.  In  Akmolinsk  and  Semipolatinsk,  as  elsewhere 
in  the  Empire,  the  Crown  provides  storehouses  of  corn 
for  the  nomads,  and  as  a  preventive  against  famine, 
there  being  in  1879  in  Akmolinsk  91  storehouses,  with 
27,946  quarters ;  and  in  Semipolatinsk  69  storehouses, 
with  6,232  quarters  of  grain,  rye,  oats,  wheat,  etc. 

Besides  the  cultivation  of  cereals  and  potatoes, 
mention  may  be  made  of  tobacco,  of  which  in  1880 
there  were  in  the  province  1,192  plantations,  covering 
an  aggregate  of  11,515  acres.  The  manufacture  of 
tobacco  in  Western  Siberia,  in  1879,  amounted  to  313 
cwt.,  of  snuff  to  3  J  cwt.,  and  of  cigarettes  to  the  number 
of  6,503,000.  The  province,  as  might  be  anticipated, 
is  rich  in  domestic  animals.  To  every  hundred  of  the 
settled  population  there  are  155 — viz.,  41  horses,  46 
horned  cattle,  62  sheep,  4  pigs,  and  2  goats  ;  whilst  to 
every  hundred  of  the  Kirghese  there  are  694 — namely, 
208  horses,  57  horned  cattle,  28  camels,  372  sheep,  and 
28  goats.  Throughout  the  province  in  1880  there  was 
a  total  of  2,525,917  domestic  animals.

IHE  STEPPE  AND  THE  PROVINCE  OF  AKMOLINSK.  i^t^ 

Turning  now  to  the  Russian  population,  in  1880  we 
find  in  the  province  13,653  births  (of  which  131  were 
illegitimate)  and  9,043  deaths,  leaving  an  increase  of 
4,613.  The  medical  staff  numbers  47,  but  this  includes 
doctors'  assistants,  called  feldshers,  veterinary  surgeons, 
and  mid  wives.* 

All  the  towns  of  the  government,  except  Omsk  and 
Kokchetovsk,  are  on  the  banks  of  the  I  shim.  Akmo- 
linsk,  situated  1,004  ^^^^  above  the  sea,  and  not  far 
from  the  source  of  the  river,  has  a  population  of 
6,000.  This  is  the  market  town  for  the  nomads  of 
the  district,  and  the  capital  of  the  province.  Akmo- 
linsk  is  not  the  residence  of  the  Russian  governor, 
however,  whom  I  met  at  Omsk,  and  from  whom  I 
learned  that  the  inhabitants  of  the  capital  are  chiefly 
Kirghese.  To  the  west,  at  the  distance  of  150  miles, 
is  Atbasar,  having  less  than  a  thousand  inhabitants.  It 
was  formerly  a  Cossack  stanitsa,  or  village,  dominating 
the  surrounding  nomads,  but  has  now  become  the 
dwelling-place  of  agriculturists  and  merchants.  About 
120  miles  north  of  Atbasar  is  Kokchetovsk,  with  a 
thousand  inhabitants,  and  at  about  the  same  distance 
further  down  the  I  shim,  on  the  road  from  Orenburg, 
is  Petropavlovsk,  with  12,000  inhabitants.  This  is 
the  most  populous  town  in  the  valley  of  the  I  shim. 
Situated  above  picturesque  rocks,  on  which  are  the 
ruins  of  a  fortress,  100  feet  above  the  river,  it  com- 
mands a  fine  view  of  the  Steppe,  over  which  the 
nomads  come  in  crowds  to  procure  commodities  and

have  become  sedentary  by  the  side  of  the  Russian 
inhabitants.  The  houses  of  the  Russians,  as  in  Siberia, 
are  built  of  logs,  quickly  put  up,  and  by  incendiaries 
still  more  speedily  destroyed.  The  number  of  fires  in 
the  province  during  1880  amounted  to  47,  destroying 
151  buildings  of  the  value  of  ;^io,293.* 

The  industries  of  Akmolinsk  in  1880  .were  repre- 
sented by  139  factories,  employing  1,408  workmen,  and 
yielding  products  to  the  value  of  ;^203,096,  namely  : —

THE  STEPPE  AND  THE  PROVINCE  OF  AKMOLINSK,  55 

The  corn  and  forests  of  Western  Siberia  are  largely 
used  for  the  distillation  of  ardent  spirits,  which  forms  a 
prominent  industry.  The  general  report  includes  the 
statistics  affecting  Aktnolinsk,  though  it  should  be 
observed  that  from  the  paucity  of  corn  grown  in 
Akmolinsk  and  Semipolatinsk,  their  part  in  the  manu- 
facture of  spirits  is  much  less  than  in  the  neighbouring 
provinces  of  Tobolsk  and  Tomsk.  In  1879-80  there 
were — distilleries  working  in  the  provinces  of  Tobolsk, 
1 1  ;  Tomsk,  1 5  ;  Akmolinsk  and  Semipolatinsk,  2  ;  in 
all,  28,  and  using  a  total  of  33,386  tons  of  corn.  From 
this  were  manufactured  2,774,476  gallons  of  pure  spirit, 
or  6,936,190  gallons  of  vodka,  reduced  to  40  per  cent. 
of  spirit,*  some  of  which  is  exported  to  European 
Russia.  The  price  of  corn  purchased  by  the  distillers 
varied,  according  to  locality,  from  25".  to  35'.  9^.  per  cwt, 
and  was  computed  at  ;^92,655  for  the  whole  of  Western 
Siberia.  Vodka  sold  from  the  cellars,  without  duty,  at 
from  5^.  to  \od,  per  gallon,  the  total  production  of  the 
distilleries  being  reckoned  at  ;^2  25,900. 

Besides  distilleries,  there  are  in  Western  Siberia  25 
beer  and  mead  breweries,  producing,  however,  only 
11,375  gallons  of  beer,  and  5,200  gallons  of  mead,  of 
the  united  value  of  ;^24,470. 

The  Government  receipts  for  duty  have  been 
constantly  rising  of  late  years — those  of  1879,  as  com- 
pared with  1876,  showing  an  increase  of  30  per  cent. 

♦  Of  vodka,  the  province  of  Akmolinsk  produced  164,482  gallons,  and 
Semipolatinsk  259,200;  and  some  idea  of  the  relative  sizes  of  the 
distilleries  in  Western  Siberia  may  be  formed  by  observing  that 

Upwards  of  650,000  gallons  were  made  by  i  distillery

The  excise  duty  for  1879  from  Western  Siberia 
amounted  to  ;^45 5,961 — namely,  wine  and  spirits, 
;^402,o84  ;  additional  on  vodka,  ;^6,6o9 ;  beer  and 
mead,  ;^i,458  ;  and  licences,  ;^45,8o9.  Whether  or  not 
this  amount  represents  all  that  ought  to  have  been  paid 
admits  of  a  doubt ;  for  Baron  Nolde,*  speaking  of  the 
whole  Empire,  goes  so  far  as  to  say  that  j^20.ooo,ooo 
yearly  find  their  way  by  fraud  into  the  pockets  of  the 
distillers.  I  heard,  when  passing  through  Western 
Siberia,  of  a  remarkable  method  of  keeping  the 
supply  of  spirits  down  and  the  prices  up.  The 
principal  distillers  of  the  district  met,  it  appeared,  from 
time  to  time,  to  arrange  the  maximum  of  their  products 
each  should  bring  into  the  market,  one  result  of  the 
conference  being  that  small  distillers  were  offered  a 
certain  sum  to  make  little  spirit,  or  even  none.  If  they 
chose  to  be  independent  and  go  their  own  way,  the 
great  distillers  combined  to  ruin  them  by  under-selling 
them ;  and,  on  the  other  hand,  I  heard  of  one  distiller 
who  received  from  this  party  of  monopolists  the  sum 
of  ;^2,ooo,  simply  for  keeping  his  factory  closed  for  a 
year.  Up  to  1 863  the  manufacture  of  spirits  was  re- 
stricted to  persons  called  otkupschiks,  usually  rich 
merchants,  who  paid  heavy  sums  to  Government  for 
the  privilege.  From  that  date  private  distilleries  were 
set  on  foot ;  dram  shops,  which  up  to  that  time  had  been 
limited  in  number,  have,  according  to  the  Baron,  in- 
creased tenfold,  whilst  the  price  of  the  liquor  decreased 
to  a  third  (though  it  has  been  rising  since),  thus  tendmg 
powerfully  to  that  wholesale  demoralization  of  Russia 
which  the  Government  at  length  is  beginning  to  realize. 
I  am  not  rich  in  statistics  bearing  exclusively  upon

THE  STEPPE  AND  THE  PROVINCE  OF  AKMOLINSK.  57 

Akmolinsk,  but  it  appears  that  in  Western  Siberia,  in 
1879,  there  were  sold  5,363,166  gallons  of  vodka,  of 
which  216,729  gallons  were  exported.  The  remainder 
was  disposed  of  in  3,232  retail  shops,  including  120 
wholesale — ^at  the  rate,,  that  is,  of  I2i  pints  of  vodka, 
or  5^  pints  of  alcohol  to  each  inhabitant  of  Western 
Siberia.*  In  the  United  Kingdom  the  consumption 
of  alcohol  was,  in  1876,  at  the  rate  of  26  pints  per  head 
of  the  population.t  Russia  is  sometimes  spoken  of  as 
a  drunken  nation,  but  if  the  foregoing  statistics  be 
trustworthy,  it  should  not  be  England  that  should  cast 
the  first  stone  at  her. 

In  Akmolinsk,  as  elsewhere,  it  is  only  a  step  from 
drink  to  crime.  Concerning  this  connection  it  may  here 
suffice  to  point  out  generally  that  in  those  parts  of  the 
province  where  the  Muhammadan  (and,  therefore, 
teetotal)  Kirghese  abound,  crime  is  less  apparent ;  but 
where  Christian  Russians  assemble,  crime  is  more 
manifest.  I  believe  this  to  be  generally  true,  both 
from  the  figures  below,  as  well  as  from  my  general 
experience  in  travelling  through  Central  Asia.  I  have 
been  careful,  however,  to  say  that  crime  is  less  apparent; 
because  the  real  criminality  of  the  nomad  population 
must  be  greater  than  indicated,  since  the  figures  here 
given  relate  to  crimes  which  came  before  the  Russian 
courts,  whereas  the  misdeeds  of  the  Kirghese  (with 
some  few  exceptions)  are  judged  by  their  own  native 
tribunals,  statistics  of  which  are  not  forthcoming. 
Throughout  the  province  in  1880  were  committed  831 

♦  In  Tobolsk  and  Akmolinsk  were  disposed  of  3,024,729  gallons,  to  a 
population  of  1,660,635,  or  14^  pints  per  head;  and  in  Tomsk  and 
Semipolatinsk  2,121,708  gallons  to  a  population  of  i»558,558,  or  10 j 
pints  to  each  man,  woman,  and  child.

crimes  and  misdemeanours,  or  i  to  every  552  persons, 
who  are  thus  distributed  :  in  the  uyezd  of  Akmolinsk^ 
less  than  i  person  in  a  thousand  is  a  malefactor ;  in 
the  uyezds  of  Atbasar  and  Kokchetovsk  the  proportion 
is  also  less  than  i  in  a  thousand ;  whereas  in  the  uyezds 
of  Petropavlovsk  and  Omsk,  which  are  more  largely 
Russian,  crime  is  committed  by  nearly  4  persons  in  a 
thousand. 

It  must  be  remembered,  moreover,  that  the  homeless 
working  class  are  largely  attracted  to  the  towns  that 
afford  greater  facilities  for  evil-doing,  so  that  usually 
in  proportion  to  the  density  of  population  of  a  district 
is  the  proportion  of  crime  committed.  If  we  confine

ON  arriving  at  Omsk  I  noticed  from  the  deck  of 
the  steamer  an  officer  on  the  landing  stage, 
whose  face  seemed  familiar  to  me.  He  turned  out  to 
be  the  police-master  who,  three  years  before,  had  shown 
me  the  prisons  of  Tomsk.  He  recognized  me,  and 
kindly  sent  men  to  look  after  the  baggage,  by  whose  help 
ere  long  we  were  safely  housed  at  the  Hotel  Moskva. 
Omsk  is  a  government  town  of  31,000  inhabitants, 
situated,  at  an  altitude  of  261  feet,  in  the  strip  of 
Russian  colonization  that  divides  the  Kirghese  of  the 
south  from  the  Tatars  of  the  north,  and  is  built  upon 
the  banks  of  the  Om,  at  its  confluence  with  the 
Irtish,  the  two  parts  of  the  town  being  connected  by 
a  substantial  wooden  bridge.  Omsk  was  founded  in 
1 7 1 7,  and  the  gateways  of  its  fortress  are  still  standing 
on  the  right  bank  of  the  river.      Near  at  hand  are

large  public  offices,  military  and  civil,  whilst  on  the 
other  side  of  the  stream  are  situated  the  large  stone 
house  of  the  Governor- General,  the  cathedral,  a 
Roman  Catholic  chapel,  some  mosques,  a  Lutheran 
church,  a  large  military  gymnase  or  high  school,  and 
several  others  lower  in  grade.  As  usual  in  Siberian 
towns,  the  streets  are  wide,  and  in  front  of  the  house 
of  the  Governor-General  is  a  triangular  public  garden ; 
but  the  glory  of  Omsk  is  undoubtedly  on  the  wane. 
Formerly  it  was  on  the  high  road  from  Europe  to 
China,  but  the  opening  of  another  road  further  north, 
and  the  conversion  of  the  Obi  into  a  summer  route, 
have  diverted  the  traffic,  and  so  lessened  its  com- 
mercial importance.  The  military  gymnase  was 
attended  in  1879  by  332  boys,  and  the  other  high 
schools  by  160  boys  and  349  girls. 

It  was  for  a  long  time  debated  whether  the  new 
Siberian  university  should  not  be  established  at  Omsk, 
but  the  decision  was  given  in  favour  of  Tomsk,  and 
the  result  must  prove  detrimental  to  the  former.  Again, 
Omsk  has  derived  much  importance  from  being 
the  seat  of  government,  and  the  residence  of  the 
Governor-General  of  Western  Siberia,  who  thus  lived 
in  about  the  centre  of  his  vice-royalty ;  whereas  now 
that  the  provinces  of  Akmolinsk  and  Semipolatinsk 
have  been  thrown  into  the  general  government  of  the 
Steppe,  that  ruler  finds  himself  all  but  expatriated 
to  the  extreme  north-east  corner  of  his  dominions, 
from  the  best  parts  of  which  he  is  a  thousand  miles 
distant.  I  heard  that  General  Kolpakovsky  had  a 
great  desire  to  transfer  the  seat  of  government  to  his 
old  quarters  at  Vierny,  so  that,  should  this  be  done, 
there  is  every  prospect  of  Omsk  declining  more  and 
more. 


62  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

On    the   day    we   arrived    it    had    been    raining   in 
torrents,   but  this  did  not  prevent  us  in  the  evening 
from  taking  a  droshky  to  make  some  calls,  and  driving 
boldly  through  the  streets  with  pools  of  water  up  to 
the  axles.      A  branch  of  the   Imperial  Geographical 
Society  was  founded  at  Omsk  in    1877,   and    I    had 
introductions  to  some  of  its  members.      One  of  the 
first  acquaintances  we  made  was  Mr.  Balkashin,  who 
has  been  appointed  the  Imperial  Russian  Consul  for 
Chuguchak,   and  he   was  only  awaiting  an  interview 
with  the  Governor-General  before  proceeding  thither. 
This  gentleman  had  lived  at  Yaroslaf,  where  he  had 
met  two   English  writers  on   Russia — Mr.  Mackenzie 
Wallace  and   Mr.    R.  S.   W.    Ralston.     He  had  also 
seen    the     Hungarian    traveller,     Mr.     Ujfalvy,    who 
describes  him  in  his  book  as  a  savant.     This  gentle- 
man gave  us  a  warm  reception,  and  sundry  pieces  of 
antiquarian  information  ;  but  what  impressed  him  most 
on  my  recollection  was  his  earnest  advice  relative  to 
my  contemplated  experiment  in  spreading  the  Scrip- 
tures among  the  Kirghese.     When  he  discovered  that 
I  thought  of  attempting  it,  he  became  quite  animated, 
and  said,  ''  Dieu  vous preserve,  Monsieur,  ne  faites pas 
cela.     The  Kirghese  are  such  bigoted  Muhammadans 
that  they  start  back  at  the  very  sight  of  a  cross,  and 
I  strongly  advise  you  to  have  nothing  whatever  to  do 
with   them   of  a   religious  character.     You  will  very 
likely  be  injured,  and  get  yourself  into  a  row,  and  the 
Russians  too  '* ;  and  as  if  this  store  of  advice  were  not 
enough,  his  parting  words  on  the  following  day  were 
to  the  same  effect. 

Another  acquaintance  we  made,  both  agreeable  and 
useful,  in  Mr.  James  Kossagovsky,  son  of  the  Governor 
of  Odessa.      He  spoke  English  well,    kindly    placed 


FROM  OMSK  TO  SEMIPOLATINSK.  63 

himself  at  our  disposal,  and  accompanied  us  next 
morning,  with  the  police-master,  to  see  the  prison. 
He  took  us  likewise  to  inspect  a  small  industrial 
asylum  founded  more  than  20  years  before  by  a  lady 
of  the  town,  named  Duganmel,  for  20  girls  and  24 
boys.  The  children  were  clothed  alike,  educated  in 
some  of  the  schools  in  the  town,  and  taught  various 
handicrafts,  at  a  total  annual  cost  of  £(>  \os.  for  each 
child,  to  defray  which  the  institution  had  a  capital  of 
;^3,ooo,  the  rest  being  made  up  by  bazaars,  concerts, 
and  voluntary  offerings.  Each  child,  I  was  told,  was 
already  provided  with  a  copy  of  the  Gospels,  but  the 
authorities  were  pleased  to  accept  some  of  my  books 
also. 

We  called  on  the  Commandant,  but  time  did  not 
allow  of  my  visiting  the  military  prison,  though  I 
arranged  for  sending  thereto  some  books.  An 
introduction  to  Colonel  Sokoloff  brought  me  into  the 
tastefully  furnished  house  of  an  officer  who  busied 
himself  in  leisure  hours  with  the  study  of  chemistry 
and  meteorology.  He  had  heard  of  my  book  on 
Siberia,  and  gave  me  a  valuable  introduction  to  the 
Russian  consul  at  Kuldja.  We  were  taken  next  to 
the  museum  ;  that  reminded  me  only  too  forcibly  of 
many  like  it  J  have  seen  in  Russia  :  of  an  undertaking 
well  begun  but  not  carried  through.  The  collection 
of  natural  history  objects  was  not  large,  though  there 
was  a  fair  number  of  beetles  and  butterflies.  More 
interesting  perhaps  to  an  antiquarian  were  some  relics 
of  a  past  age  in  bronze  and  stone.  When  Mr. 
Ujfalvy  passed  through  Omsk  in  1877,  General 
Kaznakoff  gave  him  some  stone  gouges,  and  hatchets, 
which  were  sent  to  the  Saint-Germain  Museum  in 
Paris.      They   were  discovered   at  Samarova,  where 


64  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

the  Irtish  flows  into  the  Obi,  and  I  am  under  the 
impression  that  those  I  saw  belonged  to  the  same  find. 
I  could  not,  however,  hear  of  any  objects  of  a  like 
character  having  been  found  in  the  territory  of  the 
Kirghese,  the  Russians  telling  me,  in  reply  to  my 
inquiries,  that  the  Kirghese  civilization  is  of  so 
primitive  a  character,  and  they  have  learned  to 
manufacture  so  little  for  themselves,  that  they  might, 
in  a  fashion,  be  said  to  be  still  living  in  the  stone  age. 

Our  morning  s  business  over,  we  went  to  dine  with 
General  Kurbanofsky,  properly  Governor  of  Akmo- 
linsk,  but  just  then  acting  as  Governor-General — the 
late  one.  General  Kaznakoff,  having  gone  away  ill,  and 
the  new  one.  General  Kolpakovsky,  not  having  as 
yet  arrived.  Among  my  fellow-guests  at  dinner  was 
the  Government  architect,  who  spoke  English  like  a 
native.  He  had  been  to  London  for  nine  days,  and 
was  one  of  the  very  few  Russians  I  have  ever  met 
who  was  not  pleased  therewith.  I  could  not  get  from 
him  a  good  word  for  any  of  our  buildings  but  West- 
minster Abbey,  and  he  seemed  disappointed  with 
London  as  a  whole.  A  fine  view  of  the  Steppe  on 
the  left  bank  of  the  Irtish  was  obtained  from  the 
Governor's  verandah,  and  from  thence  I  first  sighted 
a  Kirghese  auly  or  collection  of  tents,  of  which,  as  we 
travelled  south,  we  were  to  see  so  many. 

On  leaving  the  Governor's  house  we  called  on  the 
Lutheran  director  of  the  post-office,  Mr.  De  Schie- 
mann,  who  had  removed  here  from  Vologda  at  a  cost, 
he  ruefully  said,  of  £^Oy  but  which  struck  me  as  re- 
markably cheap  for  bringing  one's  effects  a  distance  of 
3,000  miles.  I  inquired  for  Pastor  Hirtz,  the  only 
Protestant  minister,  if  I  mistake  not,  in  all  Russian 
Central  Asia,  for  I   wished  to  leave  with  him  some 


FROM  OMSK  TO  SEMIPOLATINSK,  65 

Finnish  tracts  forwarded  to  Petersburg  for  me  by  my 
friend  Miss  Alba  Hellmann,  of  Wasa.  I  heard  the 
minister  spoken  well  of  for  his  ability  in  preaching,  in 
recognition  of  which  he  wears  a  gold  cross  conferred 
by  the  consistorium.  Before  leaving  Omsk  I  packed 
a  box  of  books  to  be  sent  by  Mr.  Ignatoff  s  agent  to 
the  Governor  of  Tobolsk,  and  also  made  up  four  other 
parcels,  and  sent  them  through  Mr.  Kossagovsky  to 
the  Industrial  Asylum ;  to  General  Kurbanofsky,  for 
the  supply  of  the  prisons,  hospitals,  schools,  etc.,  of 
his  province  of  Akmolinsk  ;  and  other  two  for  the 
military  and  civil  prisons  at  Omsk. 

Everyone  during  my  stay  in  the  town  was  on  the 
qui  vivCy  awaiting  the  arrival  of  General  Kolpakovsky, 
and  I  expected  to  be  obliged  to  wait  too.  My  busi- 
ness, however,  sped  so  well,  and  his  Excellency  was 
reported  to  be  so  far  off,  that  I  determined  to  start  on 
the  evening  of  the  i8th  August,  and  meet  him,  if 
possible,  at  Pavlodar.  I  was  too  well  acquainted  with 
the  "  rule  of  the  road  **  to  be  ignorant  of  the  value  of 
local  recommendations  to  the  post-masters,  and  I  had 
heard  dismal  accounts  of  the  difficulties  of  getting 
horses  in  some  parts  of  the  Steppe.  I  made  bold, 
therefore,  to  ask  of  General  Kurbanofsky  for  a  Crown 
podorojna,  which  would  give  me  a  prior  claim  to  the 
postal  steeds.  The  General,  however,  as  I  was  told, 
was  a  great  stickler  for  the  law,  and  he  replied  that  he 
had  no  power  to  give  me  such  a  podorojna,  unless  I  was 
traveUing  in  the  service  of  the  Government,  which,  I 
believe,  was  true  legally,  though  in  previous  years  I 
had  almost  always  been  favoured  with  what  I  now 
asked  for.  1  had,  therefore,  to  purchase  an  ordinary 
podorojna,  for  which,  to  Semipolatinsk,  I  paid  £1  95-.  3^., 
but  in  addition  the  General  obtained  a  letter  for  me

from  the  post-master  to  the  station-keepers,  which 
helped  me  famously.  I  was  unable  to  get  everything 
in  readiness  until  the  morning  of  the  19th,  when  we 
learned  that  our  interests  were  being  looked  after  by 
postilions,  who  came  to  tell  us  that  Cossacks  had  more 
than  once  been  sent  to  them  by  the  police-master  to 
see  that  we  were  not  delayed.  Some  of  our  ac- 
quaintances called  to  bid  us  farewell,  and  Mr.  Kossa- 
govsky,  in  Russian  fashion,  accompanied  us  on  horse- 
back for  some  few  miles  out  of  the  town. 

We  had  now  before  us  a  drive  of  nearly  500  miles 
to  Semipolatinsk,  in  the  course  of  which  we  expected 
to  change  horses  3 1  times  at  a  like  number  of  stations,* 
the  first  two  introducing  us  to  Cossack  life.  The 
Cossack  population  of  the  provinces  of  Akmolinsk 
and  Semipolatinsk  in  1879  was  located  in  149  settle- 
ments, and  made  up  of  87,723  combatants,  and  99,139 
other  persons,  t  About  25,000  combatants,  and  a 
further  population  of  28,000,  were  living  in  54  settle- 
ments, called  the  **  Irtish  line."  They  were  originally 
settled  along  the  river,  to  serve  as  a  protection  against 
the  inroads  of  the  Kirghese,  a  plan  similar  to  one  I

saw  in  1879  along  the  right  bank  of  the  Ussuri.  The 
approaches  of  the  Kirghese  are  now  no  longer  to  be 
feared,  so  that  these  Cossacks  have  practically  lost 
their  local  ratson  d'Stre,  but  Russia  has  by  their  means 
colonized  a  fruitful  terrain,  and  planted  a  succession  of 
villages,  many  of  which  have  upwards  of  400  inhabi- 
tants, some  of  them  even  possessing  churches.  The 
male  inhabitants  of  these  Cossack  villages  are  bound 
to  serve  in  war,  and  are  instructed  in  the  handling  of 
arms  by  AtamanSy  who  are  drilled  for  the  most  part  at 
Omsk,  and  who  sometimes  preside  over  the  Cossack 
communities.  The  Cossacks  have  themselves  to  pro- 
vide for  the  erection  of  their  houses,  their  uniform  and 
horses,  receiving  from  the  Government  only  weapons 
and  munitions,  and  a  pay  so  small,  that  for  a  captain  it 
amounts  to  only  28^.  a  year.  On  the  other  hand  all 
Cossacks  are  exempt  from  taxation,  and  every  head  of 
a  family  has  a  grant  of  about  100  acres  of  land  for 
cultivation.  Should  more  be  required  a  small  rent  is 
charged,  which  doubtless  is  more  than  recouped  by  the 
sums  for  pasturage  paid  by  the  Kirghese  to  the  Cos- 
sacks, to  whom  the  land  for  about  20  miles  on  either 
side  of  the  line  belongs.     These  warrior-farmers  culti- 

"  lines/*  located  in  1879  in  169  settlements,  made  up  of  94,462  com-

vate  in  the  fields  rye,  wheat,  oats,  barley,  and  millet, 
and  in  the  gardens  tobacco,  potatoes,  and  water- 
melons. They  make  also  a  quantity  of  hay,  that  in 
this  region  must  be  cheap,  for  the  director  of  the  tele- 
graph station  at  Omsk  told  me  that  most  of  his  clerks 
had  horses,  one  of  which  could  be  kept  for  from  8^.  to 
los,  a  month.  ^ 

We  travelled  well  at  setting  out,  covering  in  our  first 
22  hours  138  miles,  and  one  stage  of  12  miles  was 
accomplished  in  a  little  less  than  the  hour.  The  post- 
master's letter  doubtless  helped  us  to  some  extent,  but 
there  was  an  amiability  about  the  Cossack  station- 
masters  and  yemstchiksy  or  postilions,  who  needed  little 
persuasion  to  do  their  best.  At  each  station  I  offered^ 
Scriptures  for  sale  and  distributed  tracts,  the  former  of 
which  were  gladly  purchased,  and  the  latter  thankfully 
received.  I  suppose  it  was  this  at  the  second  station 
that  caused  the  Cossacks  to  offer  me  gratis  some  of  their 
horse-hair  rope  that  I  wanted  to  buy,  and  for  which, 
when  I  insisted  on  payment,  they  took  only  the  trifling 
sum  of  \d.  At  Cherlakovsk,  the  seventh  station,  a 
caravan  route  branches  off  to  the  town  of  Akmolinsk, 
and  at  Urlyutyupsk,  the  ninth  station,  120  miles  from 
Omsk,  we  passed  out  of  the  Akmolinsk  into  the 
Semipolatinsk  government. 

We  were  now  well  on  to  the  Steppe,  whose  straight 
unbroken  horizon  so  frequently  reminds  one  of  the 
ocean.  The  soil  is  yielding,  stoneless,  and  sandy,  thus 
making  the  smoothest  of  roads,  on  which  our  horses 
dashed  along.  The  country  is  nearly  treeless,  and  the 
ground  almost  without  vegetation,  so  that  one  had 
only  to  picture  the  surface  covered  with  snow  to  see 
the  necessity  for  the  roadside  wickerwork  erections 
to  mark  the  route  in  winter.     We  were   crossing  in

the  month  of  August  this  steppe,  parched  by  the 
summer  sun  ;  but  Dr.  Finsch,  who,  in  1 8  76,  travelled 
over  the  same  route  in  spring,  speaks  with  more 
appreciation  of  its  appearance.*  The  steppe  is  not 
indeed  a  grass- covered  flat,  for  the  verdure  is  found 
only  in  patches,  and  then  forms  no  turf,  but  grows, 
like  the  bunch  or  buffalo  grass  of  the  prairie,  in 
separate  clumps,  although  the  steppe  grass  is  longer. 
For  great  distances  the  steppe  is  covered  with  thickets 
of  the  Spiraa,  or  Meadow-sweet. 

Here  and  there  too  are  gooseberry  bushes,  inter- 
mixed with  feeble-looking  birches,  generally  less  than 
five  feet  high,  whilst  everywhere,  when  the  road  ap- 
proaches the  Irtish,  we  catch  sight  on  the  opposite  bank 
of  a  more  or  less  extensive  vegetation  of  well-grown 
trees,  such  as  willows,  poplars,  oaks,  birches,  and  pines. 
Alongside  the  river  are  frequently  found  hill-like 
chains  of  sand  resembling  downs,  with  wild  oats  and 
other  grasses.  Another  characteristic  of  the  steppe  is 
seen  in  numerous  ponds  and  lakes,  unconnected  by 
streams.  They  are  for  the  most  part  isolated,  and, 
what  is  more  remarkable,  are  in  some  cases  filled 
with  sweet,  in  others  with  salt  or  brackish,  water. 
Thus  it  happens  in  their  neighbourhood  that  one 
meets  now  with  sandy  downs,  and  then  with  those 
deposits  of  salt  that  have  been  caused  by  evaporation, 
and  frequently  impart  to  the  ground  the  appearance 
of  hoar  frost  or  snow.  In  such  quarters  the  appro- 
priate salt  flora  is  met  with.  It  is  not  until  the 
end  of  April  that  this  steppe,  near  Omsk,  begins  to 
present  a   verdant  appearance,  and  then  among  the

chapters  for  several  pieces  of  scientific  information.

first  harbingers  of  spring  are  seen  the  beautiful  blue 
Anemone,  a  yellow  Draba,  the  universal  Ranunculus, 
or  buttercup,  and  members  of  the  garlic  family. 

We  had  left  Omsk  at  noon  on  the  19th,  and  on  the 
morning  of  the  2  ist  we  arrived  at  Pavlodar,  accomplish- 
ing the  260  miles  in  44  hours.  Here  we  found  no  less 
than  45  horses  reserved  for  the  Governor-General, 
whose  coming  was  watched  for  hourly.  We  had  there- 
fore nothing  to  do  but  to  wait,  and  to  congratulate  our- 
selves in  having  to  do  so  at  such  an  excellent  station. 
All  along  the  line,  however,  the  Cossack  post-stations 
had  been  good,  reminding  me  of  the  best  of  those  in 
Siberia,  which  are  comfortable  indeed  compared  with 
the  hovels  one  met  with  further  south.  The  Cossack 
stations  were  clean,  the  floors  sometimes  painted,  and 
the  rooms  not  unfrequently  beautified  with  flowers  and 
creepers,  especially  ivy.  There  were,  of  course,  the 
usual  ugly  but  often  expensive  pictures  of  saints  in  the 
corners  of  the  guest-rooms,  and  the  miserable  Moscow 
pictures,  and  portraits  of  the  Imperial  family  and  other 
notables.  These  I  tried  to  outshine  by  nailing  to  the 
wall,  usually  under  the  ikon,  a  handsome  engraving 
representing  the  return  of  the  Prodigal  Son,  with 
the  story  in  Russ  printed  around,  similar  to  those  I 
nailed  up  in  so  many  of  the  post-houses  throughout 
Siberia. 

This  operation  constantly  opened  up  the  way  for  the 
sale  of  my  books,  and  did  so  with  the  post-master  at 
Pavlodar,  He  was  a  man  evidently  well-to-do,  as  seen 
by  the  Central  Asian  carpets  hung  on  the  walls,  and  a 
silk  khalat  in  which,  with  lordly  gait,  he  walked  about. 
I  brought  to  his  notice  a  handful  of  New  Testaments, 
Gospels,  Psalms,  etc.,  at  various  prices,  from  which  he 
might  take  his  choice ;  but,  like  a  man  of  means,  he 


FROM  OMSK  TO  SEMIPOLAIINSK,  71 

bought  the  lot  at  a  stroke  for  his  son,  about  whose 
education  he  was  evidently  solicitous.  There  was  a 
young  woman  bustling  about  the  premises,  whom  I 
took  to  be  his  daughter,  at  work,  indeed,  but  dressed 
better  than  an  ordinary  peasant,  as  also  was  the  wife, 
whom  we  were  glad  to  ask  to  prepare  us  some  dinner. 
She  brought  soup,  cutlets,  and  pancakes,  with  a  melon 
for  dessert;  and  if  we  had  not  cause  to  complain  of  such 
fare  in  the  wilderness,  we  had  still  less  reason  to 
murmur  at  the  charges.  I  have  already  mentioned 
the  cheapness  of  provisions  on  the  steamer  between 
Tiumen  and  Omsk,  where  my  steward's  bill  for  the 
best  food  the  ship  provided,  and  plenty  of  it,  for  two 
persons  for  7  days  amounted  to  only  35^.  ;  but  the 
prices  of  food  in  the  Steppe  appeared  to  outdo 
even  this,  for  I  copied,  in  one  of  the  post-stations,  a 
scale  of  charges  as  follows  iv  "Use  of  samovar,  2\d,  ; 
portion  of  bread,  2\d.\  pair  of  chickens,  td.\  a 
cooked  fowl,  \od.  ;  quart  of  milk,   \\d,^  and  10  eggs 

for  ^dr 

But  we  had  business  other  than  that  of  meeting 
the  Governor-General.  Our  personal  baggage  and 
tarantass  we  unshipped  at  Omsk,  but  my  boxes  of 
books  and  the  vehicle  to  carry  them  went  on  by 
steamer  to  Pavlodar,  from  which  point  we  were  to 
take  them  forward — the  water  being  now  too  low  to 
allow  of  the  steamer  proceeding  to  Semipolatinsk. 
When  the  boxes  arrived  at  the  post-station,  I  was 
unexpectedly  constrained  to  unpack  them.  I  have 
alluded  to  the  earnest  and  doubtless  well-meant 
advice  given  me  at  Omsk,  to  attempt  no  effort  of  a 
religious  character  among  the  Muhammadans.  To 
the  same  effect  I  was  counselled  by  a  General  on 
the  Urals,  who  deprecated  what  he  called  my  **pro- 


72  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

paganda"  among   them,  and   said  the  mullahs  were 
fanatical.     '*  General   Kaufmann,"  he  added,  "  would 
not  allow  our  own  missionaries  even  to  attempt  any 
work  among  the  Muhammadans,  and  if  you  do  any- 
thing of  the  kind  you  are  likely  to  get  yourself  into 
trouble  and  us  too.'*     Now,  so  far  as  the  latter  result 
was  likely  to  ensue,  I  was,  of  course,  unwilling  to  do 
anything  that  might  embroil  the  Russians,  especially 
after  the  gracious  manner  in  which  they  had  allowed 
me  to  go  where  I  pleased.     But  as  for  my  own  skin, 
I  felt  I  was  the  keeper  of  that,  and  I  doubted  if  there 
were  sufficient  cause  for  alarm.     Besides  which  modus 
est  in  rebus,  and  I  could  not  help  thinking  there  was 
some  via  media  between  forcing  upon  the  conquered 
the  religion  of  the  conquerors,  as  the  Muhammadans 
have  loved  in  all  ages  to  do,  and  standing  aloof  from 
them,  attempting  nothing  whatever  for  their  spiritual 
good.     As  I  said  to  my  military  adviser,  **  I  can  offer 
them  my  books,  and  if  they  do  not  choose  to  accept 
them,  I  have  only  to  pass  on.**     Accordingly  I  began 
to  practise  my  principles  in  Omsk,  the  first  town  at 
which   I  stopped,  having  any  considerable  number  of 
Kirghese.     One  of  the  mullahs  was  informed  that  I 
wished   to   see  the   mosque,    after   the   inspection   of 
which   I  placed  in  his  hand  a  Kirghese  New  Testa- 
ment, and  asked  whether  he  could  read  it.     When  I 
perceived  that  he  could  do  so,  though  apparently  not 
very  well,  I  asked  if  he  would  accept  it  as  a  souvenir 
of  my  visit.     He  replied  that  he  was  not  sure  whether 
it  was  a  proper  book  to  be  in  such  a  building,  and 
hesitated  ;  but  whether  he  thought  I  intended  it  for 
use    among    other   service    books  of  the  mosque,  or 
whether  he  was  in*  fear  of  his  interpreter,  who  spoke 
Russian,    I    am  not  clear.     In  any  case    he  did    not 


FROM  OMSK  TO  SEMIPOLATIN SK.  73 

return  the  book,  and  I  was  content  to  leave  it  with 
him  for  further  study.  My  next  attempt  was  at 
Pavlodar,  where,  as  I  offered  my  Russian  books  to  the 
post-master,  there  happened  to  be  a  Kirghese  standing 
by.  I  therefore  offered  to  sell  him  a  New  Testament 
in  his  own  tongue,  but  he  intimated  that  he  could  not 
read,  and  left  the  room — to  tell  his  co-religionists,  I 
suppose,  for  in  a  few  minutes  there  entered  two  well- 
dressed  young  Tatars  inquiring  eagerly  for  the  book. 
I  placed  it  in  the  hands  of  one  of  them,  and  he 
speedily  asked  if  I  would  sell  him  several.  How 
many  did  he  want  ?  I  asked.  Well,  he  said,  he  would 
purchase  ten  ;  which  was  a  tenth  of  all  I  had,  so 
that  I  preferred  to  sell  him  less  than  this  number  ; 
and  from  that  time  forward  I  had  not  the  least  trouble 
in  selling  my  Kirghese  Testaments  at  catalogue 
price.  A  second  couple  of  Muhammadans  came  to 
the  station  to  inquire  for  books  other  than  the  New 
Testament,  and  within  a  few  hours,  further  on  the  road, 
a  New  Testament  was  bought  by  a  mullah  ! 

Whilst  waiting  for  the  Governor  I  busied  myself 
with  my  pen — for  there  was  little  in  Pavlodar  to  merit 
attention.  It  is  called  a  **  town "  of  some  1,300 
inhabitants,  and  serves  for  a  landing-place  midway 
between  Semipolatinsk  and  Omsk.  I  may  mention, 
however,  that  from  hence  there  goes  off  a  post 
carriage  road  into  the  heart  of  the  Kirghese  steppe 
in  the  direction  of  Baian-aul  about  120  miles,  and 
Karkaraly  100  miles  further.* 

• 

*  Whether  the  post  carriage  road  continues  further  seems  doubtful. 
According  to  the  best  Russian  map  I  have,  purchased  in  1882,  in 
Petersburg,  and  supposed  to  be  corrected  up  to  date,  the  postal  road  is 
continued  from  Karkaraly  through  Akmolinsk,  and  Atbasar  to  Petro- 
pavlovsk ;  but  in  the  map  attached  to  my  post-book,  published  in  1880, 
the  post -road  ceases  at  Karkaraly. 


74  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

This  may  be  called  the  mining  district  of  the 
Steppe,  in  which  are  situated  some  rich  metallic 
deposits.  About  27  miles  from  Baian-aul  are  several 
mines  called  after  the  name  of  their  owner,  Mr. 
Alexander  Popoff,  of  Petersburg,  yielding  coal  and 
metals.  About  Karkaraly  are  other  mines  bear- 
ing the  same  name,  and  two  further  west  called 
Ushakoff.  In  these  are  found  silver,  copper,  and  iron 
in  rich  ores,  though  mining  affairs  are  not  in  a 
flourishing  condition  owing  to  the  want  of  necessary 
roads  and  sufficient  capital.  The  district  is  interest- 
ing to  the  mineralogist,  more  particularly  from  the 
occurrence  of  the  rare  Dioptas,  or  copper  emeralds, 
that  are  met  with  in  beautiful  crystals  of  an  intense 
emerald  green  colour,  but  only,  it  seems,  near  Altyn- 
tube,  about  70  miles  from  Karkaraly.  The  Russians 
denominate  the  Dioptas  **  Aschirkay'  after  their  dis- 
coverer Aschirit,  a  native  of  Tashkend. 

All  the  way  hither  from  Tiumen,  there  had  been 
following  us,  more  or  less  closely,  a  company  of 
soldiers,  towed  in  a  barge  by  our  steamer  to  Omsk, 
and  now  brought  forward  to  Pavlodar,  whence  they 
were  to  march  into  Turkistan.  Large  numbers  of 
young  recruits  are  every  year  thus  sent  to  Tashkend, 
and  one  person  in  Tiumen  mentioned  to  me  signi- 
ficantly that  he  saw  many  soldiers  going  thither,  but 
few  coming  back ;  which  afterwards  I  thought  largely 
accounted  for  by  a  somewhat  heavy  mortality,  and 
also  from  the  fact  that  Russian  labour  being  scarce  in 
Central  Asia,  and  their  return  home  not  being  without 
difficulties,  they  prefer  to  stay  in  the  warmer  climate 
to  which  military  duty  has  introduced  them.* 

•  Many  of  the   Turkistan    troops   come,  I   believe,  from  Western 
Siberia,  the  local  Kalendar  for  1882  furnishing  some  interesting  details. 


FROM  OMSK  TO  SEMIPOLATINSK.  75 

I  believe  the  soldiers  at  Pavlodar  were  to  be  inspected 
by  the  Governor -General  on  his  arrival,  for  which, 
however,  we  discovered  in  the  afternoon  that  we  need 
not  wait,  as  tidings  came  to  the  post-master  relative  to 
his  Excellency's  whereabouts,  and  knowing  that  he 
did  not  usually  travel  at  night,  we  were  told  that  we 
might  have  the  necessary  horses  for  our  two  vehicles, 
proceed,  and  meet  the  General  some  stations  ahead. 
Accordingly  we  set  out  towards  evening,  and  after 
driving  through  the  night  a  distance  of  50  miles,  found 
ourselves  in  the  early  morning  at  Cherna,  where,  not- 
withstanding the  rain,  the  people  were  in  the  white 
heat  of  expectation  awaiting  the  Governor-General. 
The  post-house  was  brushed  up  to  its  maximum  pre- 
sentability,  and  everyone  was  getting  more  and  more 
excited.  Some  unhappy  man  in  the  room  adjoining 
ours,  who  seemed  to  be  out  of  the  fun,  was  talking 
loudly  and  boastfully  what  he  would  do  under  the 
circumstances,  whilst  every  man,  woman,  and  child 
in  the  hamlet  appeared  to  have  turned  out  to  bear  a 
part  in  providing  or  changing  horses,  or  to  perform  the 
all-important  business  of  **  looking  on.**  It  was  the 
first  time  General  Kolpakovsky,  qim  Governor- General, 
had  passed,  and  who  could  resist  the  desire  to  get  a 

Of  33,502  examined  in  Western  Siberia  in  1879,  it  would  appear  that 
98  per  cent,  were  Russians,  nearly  i  per  cent.  Tatars,  the  remaining 
I  per  cent,  bein/^  made  up  in  decreasing  proportions  of  Jews,  Little- 
Russians,  Mordvins,  Poles,  Chukhons,  Fins,  Mongols,  Lithuanians, 
Gypsies,  Chuvashes,  Cherkess,  and  Jmudi.  Some  of  them  were  not 
great  of  stature,  for  out  of  2i}^y\2i*]  men  approved,  two  did  not  exceed 
42  inches  in  height.  There  were,  however,  1,572  measured  5  ft.  2  in., 
and  the  numbers  went  on  increasing  to  the  maximum  of  4,693,  who 
measured  5  ft.  6  in.,  after  which    the   numbers  decreased  to  1.014  at 

5  ft.  10  in.,  and  so  on  to  2  Brobdingnagians,  who  had  each  attained  to 

6  ft.  5  in.  ;  the  average  stature  of  the  men  being  5  ft.  5^  in.  With  regard 
to  size  round  the  chest,  the  biggest  man  measured  44  in.,  the  least 
2b\  in.,  the  average  measurement  being  34I  in. 


76  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

peep  at  the  Viceroy  ?  As  for  our  humble  selves,  we, 
for  the  time  of  course,  were  nobodies,  and  I  was  content 
to  do  my  best,  under  difficulties,  to  procure  for  myself  a 
clean  face  and  hands,  from  my  india-rubber  basin,  under 
a  shed  in  the  yard.  Presently  two  outriders  dashed 
into  the  village,  as  if  on  their  speed  depended  their 
lives. 

And  now  there  was  hurrying  to  and  fro,  shouting, 
talking,  haranguing,  and  bawling,  whilst  I,  with  the 
calmest  nerves  I  could  command,  took  up  my  stand  in 
the  guest-room.  At  last  appeared  the  first  carriage 
of  the  viceregal  cortej^e, — a  tarantass  like  our  own — 
then  a  second,  a  third,  a  fourth,  and  so  on  to  the 
eleventh,  to  each  of  which  fresh  horses  had  to  be 
attached  in  an  incredibly  few  minutes.  Soon  there 
walked  into  the  station  a  youth,  who  I  was  told  was  an 
aide-de-camp.  To  him  I  addressed  myself  in  French,  ex- 
plaining who  I  was,  and  what  I  wanted  of  the  Governor- 
General.  He  replied  that  his  father  was  coming  in, 
and  would  speak  to  me.  Unfortunately  for  me,  his 
Excellency  had  not  enjoyed  the  education  he  was 
giving  to  his  sons;  for  he  was  one  of  those  Turkistan 
officers  who  had  risen  from  the  ranks  to  the  highest 
position  and  respect,  like  another  I  afterwards  met,  but 
who  also  had  to  speak  to  me  through  his  interpreter. 
Another  son  entered  the  post-house  with  his  father, 
and  interpreted  for  me  in  French,  with  an  ability  that 
I  thought  I  had  never  seen  excelled.  The  General 
had  heard  of  my  coming,  and  expected  to  see  me  at 
Pavlodar.  I  explained  that  I  was  anxious  to  get  on 
as  fast  as  possible,  and  presented  a  letter  from  the 
Minister  of  the  Interior,  accompanying  it  with  a  request 
that  I  might  be  furnished  with  a  **  courier,"  or  a 
**  Crown  "  podorojna,  and  be  saved  the  possibility  of

coming  to   a    standstill  in   the    Steppe   for  want   of 
horses. 

Nothing  could  have  been  kinder  than  his  Excel- 
lency's attention  in  listening  to  all  I  had  to  say,  and 
promising  to  telegraph  along  my  route  to  facilitate  my 
journey.  I  hardly  supposed  that  he  could  give  me  a 
formal  letter  during  this  few  minutes'  stay  at  the  post- 
station  ;  but  I  had  provided  writing  materials,  paper, 
ink  and  cards,  even  to  a  stylographic  pen,  with  which 
the  General  wrote  on  his  own  card  that  all  and  sundry 
were  to  show  us  attention,  and  accord  assistance  if 
needed.  This  was  to  serve  us  to  Semipolatinsk,  and 
when  I  reached  there  I  found  awaiting  me  this  mag- 
nanimous telegram  : — - 

**  Recommendation  to  local  authorities. 
**  I  desh^e  that  all  administrative  authorities  and  postal 
contractors  in  the  general  government  of  the  Steppe 
show  hospitality,  provide  interpreters  and  guides,  and 
help  forward  without  delay  the  English  traveller,  Pastor 
Lansdell,  who  is  travelling  through  the  Semirechia 
oblast  to  Kuldja  and  Turkistan. 

**  (Signed)  Governor-General 

**  Lieut.-Gen.  Kolpakovsky.'' 

Gentlemen  of  England,  who  live  at  home  at  ease,  or 
who,  when  they  voyage  to  the  south  of  France,  tele- 
graph to  Paris  for  compartments  reserved,  and  write 
to  the  Times  if  they  are  not  satisfied, — velvet-cushion 
travellers  such  as  these  can  only  feebly  appreciate  the 
value  of  such  a  telegram  in  the  steppes  of  Central  Asia. 
To  say  that  it  was  worth  its  weight  in  gold  is  only  faint 
praise ;  but  perhaps  I  had  better  not  be  too  lavish  of 
my  superlatives  here,  because,  when  returning  to  the 
same  subject,  I  shall  want  them  further  on.     Suffice 


78  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

it  now  to  say  that,  after  a  hearty  shake  of  the  hand 
and  the  kindest  of  farewells,  the  General  sped  on  his 
way,  but  not  before  he  had  thoughtfully  remembered 
that  he  was  taking  away  more  than  40  horses,  which 
might  have  left  us  high  and  dry,  had  he  not  bade  the 
starosta  to  supply  our  wants,  and  send  us  on  as  quickly 
as  possible.  This  magic  word  exalted  us  speedily  from 
nobodies  to  somebodies,  and  the  men  dashed  at  our 
vehicles  to  equip  them  for  our  immediate  departure, 
as  if  they  thought  we  were  going  to  tear  after  the 
Governor  with  the  rest. 

We  how  posted  on  to  the  next  station,  Lebyaj, 
where  the  Viceroy  had  spent  the  night,  and  where,  in 
the  guest-room  of  the  station,  the  blooming  oleanders, 
and  flowers  in  tubs  and  pots,  bore  witness  to  the 
welcome  his  hosts  had  provided.  At  this  point  another 
caravan  route  crossed  our  road,  extending  on  the  right 
to  the  Russian  colony  of  Karkaraly,  and  by  dusk  we 
found  ourselves  three  stations  further  on,  at  Semiyarsk, 
where  there  was  just  light  enough  to  see  the  outlines 
of  a  somewhat  pretentious  mosque,  no  longer  used. 
At  this  station  also  was  another  caravan  route  joining 
that  from  Lebyaj.  We  posted  on  through  the  night, 
or  at  least  wished  to  do  so,  but  on  arriving  at  the  next 
station  the  horses  were  found  to  be  turned  out  for  the 
night,  and  to  collect  them  from  a  pasture  where  hurdles 
and  bounds  are  unknown  was  not  to  be  done  in  a  minute. 
For  five  hours  we  had  to  wait  (my  longest  delay,  let 
me  thankfully  add,  that  I  anywhere  experienced  in  the 
Steppe),  during  which  it  seemed  utterly  vain  to  storm 
at  the  post-master,  whose  heart  and  conscience  were 
doubtless  hardened,  for  his  complaint  book  was  full  of 
the  lamentations  and  threats  of  preceding  travellers. 

I   have  spoken  of  the  Irtish  steppe  as  sandy  and 


FROM  OMSK  TO  SEMIPOLATINSK.  79 

stoneless ;  but  after  passing  the  nineteenth  station, 
large,  isolated  stones  are  here  and  there  visible,  and 
between  Grachevsk  and  Cheremkhovsk,  the  approach- 
ing station,  are  rock  deposits,  and  limestone,  that  is 
burnt  in  kilns  near  the  village.  Pallas  mentions  this 
stone  quarry,  which  in  his  day  supplied  the  material 
for  the  new  fortification  at  Omsk,  in  which,  besides  the 
exiles,  100  Cossacks  laboured. 

All  the  way  from  Omsk  the  road  had  kept  company 
with  the  river,  which  we  never  lost  sight  of  very  long. 
As  in  other  northerly  flowing  rivers  of  Asia,  the  right 
bank  is  tolerably  high  and  the  left  flat,  the  numerous 
islands  of  the  Irtish  being  covered  with  thickets  of 
willows  and  reeds.  The  banks  are  of  sand,  in  which 
are  found  pockets  of  impure  gypsum  occasionally  of 
crystalline  shapes.  The  Cossacks  burn  this  gypsum  in 
ovens,  and  employ  it  to  whiten  their  rooms.  Another 
gain  to  them  from  the  river  is  an  abundance  of  fish, 
for  the  capture  of  which  they  employ  boats  of  poplar, 
brought  from  Urman,  a  boat  30  feet  long  and  5  broad 
costing  about  £2,  Among  the  fish  they  take  are  Pike 
{JSsox  Lticius)y  Nielma  Salmon  {Coregontis  Leucichthys), 
Yass  (Sqtialius  Grislagine),  Perch  {Perca  Fluvzatilzs), 
Nalym  {Lota  Vulgaris),  and  Tschebak  or  bream.  Of 
Sturgeons  the  Sterlet  is  most  frequently  taken,  but 
larger  descriptions  are  also  met  with. 

We  breakfasted  at  Cheremkhovsk,  and  found  that 
the  character  of  the  landscape  had  completely  changed. 
On  leaving  Pavlodar  the  aspect  of  the  country  was 
bare  in  the  extreme,  and  hardly  a  tree  was  visible,  but 
now,  although  the  soil  continued  sandy,  it  was  occupied 
by  tall  pine-trees,  which  occasionally  were  so  numerous 
as  to  present  a  forest  appearance.  Indeed,  we  had  on 
our  left  a  triangular  forest  district  of  conifers,  extending

to  lOO  miles  at  the  base,  and  I  observed  also  along  the 
road  poplars,  Scotch  firs,  and  willows.  The  vegetation 
also  improved,  though  there  was  little  grass,  and  that 
little  mixed  with  rushes.  We  found  clover  and  immor- 
telles, and  at  the  next  station,  Dolonsk,  bought  a 
melon  for  5^.,  five  times  what  it  would  have  cost 
further  south. 

With  improved  vegetation  came  a  greater  develop- 
ment of  animal  life,  and  I  noticed  the  appearance  of 
Hooded  Crows,  Magpies,  various  kinds  of  Hawks,  and 
birds  that  I  took  to  be  Plovers,  In  crossing  the  Irtish 
steppe  in  spring,  Dr.  Finsch  frequently  met  with 
Whooper  Swans  {Cygnus  Mustcus)  in  flocks,  sometimes 
of  20  or  more,  which  he  supposed  to  breed  in  the 
locality. 

Both  Winter  and  Black-headed  Gulls  {Larus  Canus 
and  Ridibundus)  are  frequently  seen  soaring  above  the 
deserted  Steppe,  far,  very  far  from  water,  looking 
doubtless  for  insects  and  worms  as  food.  The  Oyster- 
catcher  {HcBtnatopus  Ostralegus)  is  also  occasionally 
met  with,  and  the  Yellow-headed  Wagtail  (RIotacilla 
Cztreola),  In  the  sandy  banks  of  the  Irtish  are  found 
numerous  nest  holes  of  Sand  Martins  {Cottle  Riparid)^ 
which  nest  here  in  common  with  the  House  Martin 
{Chelidon  Urbicd).  These  last,  however,  do  not  exca- 
vate nest  tunnels,  but  only  shallow  holes.  In  April 
White-winged  Larks  {Alauda  Sibiricd)  show  them- 
selves in  large  flights,  and  the  sweet  trill  is  heard  of 
the  Skylark  {Alauda  Arvensis),  notwithstanding  the 
frequent  showers  of  snow  and  hail.  By  erecting  boxes 
on  poles,  the  Cossacks  provide  nesting  places  for 
house  and  tree  Sparrows,  and  sometimes  Starlings ; 
but  Magpies,  Crows,  Jackdaws,  and  Ravens  have  to 
make  their  own  arrangements  for  nests  on  the  bush-

like  dwarf-birches.*  I  noticed  about  the  villages  of 
the  Steppe,  as  I  constantly  did  through  Siberia  in  1879, 
a  variety  of  Hawks  and  Kites.  Of  the  Brahminy  Kite 
{Mzlvus  Govinda)  several  specimens  are  seen.  The 
charming  Red-footed  Falcon  {Falco  Vespertinus)  holds 
its  quarters  particularly  along  the  telegraph  line,  that 
possesses,  I  have  frequently  noticed  in  treeless  regions, 
so  much  attraction  for  all  birds  of  prey,  the  wires  and 
poles  being  so  readily  adapted  by  them  for  resting 
points.  On  the  poles  are  often  seen  perched  the 
Osprey  {Pandion  Haliaetus),  and,  further  south,  other 
Eagles.  The  Lesser  Kestrel  {Falco  Cenchris)  is  not 
rare.  Now  and  again  a  Little  Bustard  {Otis  Tetrax) 
dashes  by  the  traveller  with  heavy  wing,  soon,  how- 
ever, to  settle  again,  as  also  does  its  larger  congener 
{Otis  Tarda).  On  the  downs  of  the  Irtish  is  seen  the 
Willow  Ptarmigan  {Lagopus  Albus),  and  keeping  near

small  collection  of  birds'  eggs  found  in  the  neighbourhood,  which  last 
Mr.  H.  E.  Dresser,  the  well-known  author  of  the  *•  Birds  of  Europe,'*

and  amongst  the  herds  of  cattle,  as  is  their  wont,  are 
to  be  espied  flocks  of  Sociable  Plovers  {Chettusia 
Gregaria). 

Post-horses  failed  us  at  Dolonsk,  but  by  paying 
extra  we  were  able  to  hire  private  cattle,  though  by 
reason  of  the  sandiness  of  the  road  we  were  obliged  to 
take  four  horses  for  each  conveyance ;  and  when  we 
reached  Semipolatinsk,  our  four  days'  drive  of  482 
miles,  including  refreshments,  the  hire  of  134  horses, 
and  gratuities  to  each  of  44  drivers,  had  cost  us  less 
than  £6.  We  arrived  at  midnight,  and  speedily  found 
ourselves  in  comfortable  quarters  at  Stepanof  s  hotel. 


CHAPTER  VI. 

THE  PROVINCE  OF  SEMIPOLATINSK :   ITS  NATURAL 

FEATURES. 

Dimensions  of  province :  its  surface,  river  basins,  mountains,  and 
passes. — The  River  Irtish :  its  scenery,  tributaries,  banks,  and 
floods. — Zaisan  lake  and  its  Cossack  fisheries. — Fauna  of  banks. 
— Geology  of  neighbourhood  and  minerals. — Mineral  springs. — 
Forests  of  the  province. — Wild  and  domesticated  animals. — Towns 
of  the  province,  and  uyezds,  with  their  populations. 

THE  province  of  Semipolatinsk  forms  a  rude 
triangle,  whose  flattened  apex  touches  the 
government  of  Tobolsk  on  the  north,  the  east  and 
west  sides  of  which  are  bounded  by  the  governments 
of  Tomsk  and  Akmolinsk,  whilst  its  irregular  arbitrary 
base  is  contiguous  to  the  Chinese  frontier,  the  province 
of  Semirechia,  and  part  of  the  Balkhash  lake.  Its 
extreme  length  from  north  to  south  is  about  650  miles, 
its  greatest  width  about  550  miles,  with  an  area  of 
188,333  square  miles,  or  about  the  size  of  Spain.  To 
the  north  the  country  is  a  low  flat  steppe,  without  any 
marked  watersheds.  Proceeding  south,  little  hillocks 
are  met  with,  capped  with  blocks  of  red  and  orange 
stone,  and  there  appear  in  the  distance  the  sharp  blue 
outlines  of  the  Altai  range,  approaching  which  the  soil 
partakes  pf  a  more  rocky  nature,  with  blocks  of  quartz,

slate,  and  porphyry.  Scattered  among  the  green  grass 
of  the  Steppe  are  coarse,  brown,  dry  and  saliferous 
patches,  the  country  in  some  places  being  clothed  with 
incrustations  of  salt,  looking  like  snow-fields.  Near  the 
town  of  Semipolatinsk  high  sand-dunes  are  prominent, 
whilst  close  to  the  mountains  the  character  of  the 
landscape  presents  considerable  variety.  The  steppe 
is  clothed  with  coarse  high  grass,  and  is  dotted  over 
with  yourts  or  tents,  around  which  wander  camels  and 
horses  with  galloping  Kirghese  horsemen.  On  the 
reedy  banks  of  brackish  streams,  wading  birds  strut 
about,  whilst  in  the  background  rises  the  sharp,  jagged 
outline  of  the  Arcat  chain,  consisting  of  piles  of 
granite,  with  needle-like  peaks,  and  flat  terraces 
apparently  formed  of  gneiss. 

The  division  of  the  province  into  river  basins  would 
be,  first,  the  south-western  or  Balkhash,  bounded  on 
the  north-east  by  the  Djenghis-Tau  or  **  hills  of  the 
lakes"  ;  next  the  Upper  Irtish  or  Zaisan  basin,  bounded 
on  the  south  and  west  by  the  Tarbagatai  mountains  ; 
and  lastly  the  Lower  Irtish  basin,  bounded  on  the  north- 
east by  the  Altai,  on  the  south-west  by  the  Tarbagatai 
and  Djenghis-Tau,  and  having  the  north  open.  The 
chief  mountains  of  the  province,  apart  from  spurs  of 
the  Altai  and  the  comparatively  small  Kalbinsk  range 
in  the  south-east,  are  the  Tarbagatai,  a  mass  about 
equal  to  the  Pyrenees  in  length  and  height,  rising  in 
a  space  about  250  miles  wide,  that  separates  the 
massive  eastern  extremes  of  the  Thian  Shan  and  the 
western  Altai.* 

♦  The  mountains  of  the  Tarbagam,  or  "marmot/*  consist  of  three 
branches :  one  running  west  by  north,  called  the  Djenghis-Tau,  with  an 
average  height  of  4,000  feet ;  the  north-east  branch,  separating  the 
Upper  and  Lower  Irtish  valleys,  with  an  average  height  also  of  4,000 
feet ;  and  the  south  branch,  with  an  average  of  6,000  feet.    In  this  last 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  SEMIPOLATINSK,  85 

The  greatest  gaps  in  the  mountains  are  :  The  valley 
of  the  Kara  Irtish  where  it  enters  the  Zaisan,  at  an 
elevation  of  about  1,400  feet ;  the  valley  of  the  Irtish 
proper  above  the  town  of  Ust-Kamenog6rsk,  about 
1,300  feet;  and  that  of  the  Urzubai  at  about  the  like 
elevation.  Besides  these  wide  depressions,  showing 
by  heaps  of  stones,  such  as  are  seen  in  moraines,  that 
glaciers  have  existed,  there  are  several  defiles,  and 
passes  to  the  number  of  14  in  all,  by  which  the 
Tarbagatai  is  crossed.* 

The  one  great  river  of  the  province  is  the  Irtish,  of 
which  the  Mongol  name  is  **  Ertchis."  According  to 
Tatar  traditions  the  name  of  this  river  was  given  by 
the  Tatar  Khan  Irtyshak,  who  ruled  over  Siberia  late 
in  the  fifteenth  century.  If  the  etymology  be  Tatar, 
**  Ir"  means  earth,  and  "  tysh  "  fissure  or  crack,  perhaps 
because  the  chief  of  the  two  branches  of  the  Irtish 
falls  in  a  cascade  out  of  a  mountain  gap.  It  is  sup- 
posed to  rise  at  a  height  of  10,000  feet  amongst  the 
Chinese  Altai  snows.     It  flows  in  a  straight  course  for 

branch  are  found  the  highest  peaks  of  the  whole  range,  those  of  the 
Muz-Tau,  or  ice  mountain,  11,000  feet  high,  and  the  Saur,  both  being 
snow-capped.  The  line  of  perpetual  snow  on  the  Tarbagatai  is  9,000 
feet,  and  on  the  Saur  10,700  feet.  The  southern  branch  of  the  Tar- 
bagatai is  clothed  with  forests  of  firs  and  poplars,  and  below  the  forest 
zone  glaciers,  in  several  places,  extend  into  the  valleys.  On  the 
southern  slopes  of  a  large  portion  of  the  western  Tarbagatai  no  snow 
is  seen  the  whole  year  round,  except  on  the  Tas-Tau  (9,614  feet  high),  a 
double-peaked  mountain,  solitary  and  bare  of  vegetation,  composed  of 
clay  and  dolomite,  together  with  granites  and  porphyries,  one  peak  of 
which  the  Chinese  call  the  Standard,  from  their  annually  unfurling 
there  a  flag.  The  elevated  side  of  these  mountains,  and  of  the  Altai 
spurs  on  the  north,  is  the  south-east,  that  being  part  of  the  Central 
Asian  plateau.

130  miles  till  it  approaches  the  eastern  ^end  of  Lake 
Uliungun* 

From  this  point  the  stream  is  called  the  **  Kara/'  or 
**  Black"  Irtish,  under  which  name  it  has  a  course  of 
373  miles,  the  entire  length  of  the  river  being  2,075 
miles.  Just  before  entering  Russian  territory  its  mean 
depth  is  ID  feet ;  its  breadth  686  feet ;  its  volume 
793,000  cubic  feet  per  minute,  or  about  three  times  as 
much  water  as  the  Seine  rolls  under  the  bridges  of 
Paris.t 

During  its  course  towards  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  it 
receives  on  the  right  bank  the  Altai  tributaries,  the 
Karaburek,  Kalgut,  Kurchum,  Kainda,  Narim,  and 
Bukhtarma,  after  which  the  stream  becomes  more 
rapid  and  the  mountains  close  inwards,  perpendicular 
rocks   rise   out  of  the  streams,   on  one  of   which  is 

*  There  are  strong  reasons,  however,  for  supposing  that  this  stream 
is  only  a  tributary  of  the  Uliungur  that  rises  on  the  Kobdo  plateau, 
flc  W3  south  till  it  rounds  the  promontory  of  the  Tsin-Guntee  mountains, 
and  then,  completing  a  course  of  300  noiles,  flows  north-west  at  a  low 
gradient  into  the  lake.  Between  the  eastern  shore  of  the  lake  and  the 
so-called  Irtish,  already  mentioned,  runs  a  low  ridge,  which  disappears 
towards  the  north,  where  the  lake  and  the  Irtish  are  only  two  miles 
apart,  and  where  the  Kirghese  point  to  a  dry  watercourse,  said  to  be 
filled  in  spring  by  the  overflow  from  the  lake.  {See  ''Recent  Russian 
Explorations  in  Western  Mongolia,"  Markham's  Geographical 
Magazine f  July,  1875.)  At  this  point  there  is,  in  the  opinion  of  Captain 
Miroshnichenko,  a  subterranean  communication  between  the  lake  and 
the  Irtish  ;  for  whereas  the  volume  of  the  river  is  36,000  cubic  feet  per 
minute  at  a  spot  13  miles  above  the  lake,  it  is  125,000  cubic  feet,  or 
more  than  three  times  as  much,  below  it. 

t  Thus  far  the  two  large  tributaries  on  the  right  bank  have  been  the 
Kran  and  the  Burgum,  besides  which  may  be  mentioned  the  Koba, 
Alkabek,  Kaljir,  and  Tokyr,  whilst  on  the  left  bank  flow  in  the  Suptu- 
kurt,  Ku-Irtysh,  Burutogoi,  and  the  Temir-Su.  The  river  now  enters 
Russian  territory,  and  receives  the  Kalba  and  the  Koldjur,  this  latter 
bringing  the  drainage  from  a  mountain  lake,  the  Marka-Kul,  about  60 
miles  distant,  1,360  feet  high,  measuring  27  miles  long  by  17  wide,  and 
with  an  area  of  154  square  miles.  Further  on  the  Kara  Irtish  divides 
into  three  branches,  with  marshy  banks,  and  flows  gently  across  the

poised  a  huge  granite  boulder  overhanging  the  water, 
the  landscape  presenting  for  rock  scenery  one  of  the 
most  picturesque  of  views,  compared  with  which,  Mr. 
Atkinson  says,  the  scenery  of  the  Rhine  is  small  and 
tame.  In  some  parts  the  mountains  rise  to  an 
enormous  height  above  the  water,  and  are  so  nearly 
perpendicular  that  no  man  could  climb  them.  Some 
of  the  rocks  are  jasper  of  a  dark  reddish  brown, 
others  of  a  deep  purple,  contrasting  beautifully  with 
the  yellow  and  green  mosses  and  lichens  growing 
thereon.  But  no  luxuriant  vegetation  is  visible ;  no 
forests,  no  fields.  Every  now  and  then  appears  an 
islet  clothed  with  poplars  and  willows,  but  that  is  all 
except  a  few  grey  bushes  on  tht  rocks.  There  are 
many  rapids,  but  not  too  swift  for  navigation.  Further 
down,  terraces  about  25  feet  above  high  water  mark 
show  that  of  old  the  Irtish  had  a  higher  level  either 
from  having  a  greater  volume  of  water,  or  because  in 
course  of  time  the  river  has  worn  for  itself  a  deeper 
bed.  At  Ust-Kamenogorsk  the  long  stretch  of  rapids 
ends  abruptly,  the  river,  now  at  an  altitude  of  1,128 
feet,  opens  out  widely,  and  enters  on  its  path  across 
the  steppe  in  a  broad  clay  bed,  winding  about  among 
numerous  large  islands,  several  of  an  area  of  from  10 
to  40  square  miles.* 

Bosangir  flats  into  the  Zaisan  lake.  On  emerging  at  an  altitude  of 
1,345  feet,  the  river,  now  called  the  "White"  Irtish,  that  has  hitherto 
had  a  straight  course,  becomes  very  winding,  flowing  north  till  it 
rounds  the  **  Bolshoi  '*  or  Great  Altai  range,  then  north-east  till  close 
to  the  84th  meridian  of  east  longitude,  then  north-west  past  Ust- 
Kamenogorsk,  within  about  50  miles  of  which  town  the  gradient  of  the 
river  is  ^rinr*  ^^  about  3  feet  in  a  mile. 

*  On  the  left  bank  also  there  are  several  tributaries  not  yet  alluded 
to :  the  Kenderlik,  foaming  and  thundering  down  the  rocks  to  the 
steppe,  and  then  with  spirit  tamed  flowing  slowly  across  the  Bosangir 
flats  into  the  Zaisan  ;  the  Kokpekti,  rising  near  the  Karakol  pass :  the 
Char-Gurban,  rising  n  jrth  of  Kokpektinsk,  but  on  the  other  side  of  the

RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 


In  its  long  dreary  journey  to  the  north,  the  Irtish 
nowadays  receives  few  tributaries.  The  hundreds  of 
rivulets  that  used  to  flow  into  it,  having  had  their 
mouths  barred  by  sand,  now  form  marshes.  The 
sand-hills,  too,  bordering  the  river,  held  together  of 
old  by  forests  of  pine  that  have  now  been  cut,  have 
begun  to  show  signs  of  instability,  and,  by  their 
beginning  to  give  way,  threaten  the  destruction  of 
villages,  and  even  of  the  capital  itself.  It  is  a  similar 
phenomenon  to  that  which  occurred  in  the  middle 
ages  at  the  time  of  the  destruction  of  the  forests  that 
grew  upon  the  sand-downs  on  the  coast  of  Gascony. 

In  winter,  when  the  rivers  are  frozen  (in  some 
places  to  the  bottom"),  the  course  is  thus  blocked,  and 
in  various  spots  the  water  bursts  up  the  ice  from  below, 
spouts  out  of  the  cracks,  spreads  over  the  surface,  and 
is  there  frozen,  to  the  continual  thickening  of  the  ice. 
Near  Pavlodar,  this  bursting  of  the  ice  appears  to 
result  in  considerable  inundations  of  the  Steppe.* 
Unlike  most  rivers  having  their  rise  in  snow  moun- 
tains, such  as  the  Rhine  and  Rhone,  which  are  highest 

mountains,  flowing  first  north-west,  then  north,  and  entering  the  White 
Irtish  above  the  capital,  whilst  below  the  capital  is  the  largest  tributary 
of  all— the  Chaganka,  made  up  of  two  great  tributaries,  the  Aschi-Su, 
rising  close  to  the  Karakol  pass,  and  the  Chagan,  coming  from  the 
south-west. 

•  The  mean  dates  (O.  S.)  of  the  opening  and  closing  of  the  Irtish  at 
various  points,  computed  on  averages  of  periods  varying  from  three  to 
thirteen  years,  is  as  follows : —

in  July  and  August,  the  Irtish  is  lowest  in  summer,  at 
which  time  the  shallowness,  caused  by  drought,  lays 
bare  rocks  in  the  bed  at  Semipolatinsk,  so  that 
whereas  Dr.  Finsch  mentions  that  the  men  had  diffi- 
culty in  spring  in  rowing  across  the  dashing  stream 
a  ferry  such  as  would  carry  tarantass  and  horses,  I 
was  able  to  drive  through  the  river  without  even 
wetting  the  bottom  of  the  carriage.  In  1 864  a  steamer 
ascended  to  the  Black  Irtish  as  far  as  Ak-tube,  below 
the  confluence  of  the  Koldjur,  and  a  great  stimulus 
to  trade  was  given  by  the  establishment,  in  1880,  of 
steamboat  traffic  in  spring  between  the  capital  and 
the  lower  river.  The  Irtish,  as  stated  before,  is  rich 
in  fish,  as  also  is  Lake  Zaisan.  It  is  believed  that  by 
cross-breeding  of  the  fish  of  this  lake  with  European 
species,  the  latter  might  be  greatly  improved.  A 
piscicultural  effort  was  made  some  time  since  by 
Lieutenant  Friedrichs  to  stock  the  Balkhash  with  fish 
transported  by  land  from  the  Irtish,  but  the  experiment 
failed. 

The  two  principal  lakes  of  the  province  are  the 
Balkhash,  or  rather  a  portion  of  it,  which  I  sighted, 
and  shall  describe  hereafter,  and  the  Nor-Zaisan, 
situated  in  the  south-eastern  corner  of  the  province, 
in  the  midst  of  a  vast  steppe,  whence  one  sees  the 
snowy  peaks  of  the  Altai  to  the  north,  and  of  the  Saur 
on  the^outh.  The  Siberians  of  the  seventeenth  century 
called  the  lake  Kyzalpu.  The  Mongols  euphoniously 
named  it  Kun-Bloti-Nor,  or  the  Lake  of  Bells,  on 
account  of  its  waves  producing,  when  striking  against 
some  parts  of  the  shore  overgrown  with  weeds,  a 
sound  that  resembled  from  a  distance  the  tinkling 
of  bells.  Its  present  appellation  was  given  by  the 
Kalmuks  in  1650,  when,  during  a  period  of  famine, 


90  liUSSIAN  CEIfTRAL  ASIA. 

they  supported  themselves  from  its  fish,  and  called  it 
Zaisan,*  meaning  "  noble  "  or  "  honourable." 

The  following  kinds  of  fish  are  found  in  the  Zaisan : 
The  Sturgeon  (Accipenser  Sturio),  Sterlet  {Accipenser 
Rutfienus),  Nelma  Salmon  {Salmo  Nelmd),  Grayling  or 
Taimen  {Salmo  Fluvialis\  Trout  {Salmo  Lena),  Pike, 
Roach,  Perch,  Carp,  and  Burbot.  The  Sturgeon  are 
of  two  species.  The  flesh  of  the  first  is  tender,  and 
of  rich  flavour ;  the  second  has  a  dark  shiny  skin, 
firm,  coarse  flesh,  and  so  hard  that  even  long  boiling 
will  not  soften  it.  The  head  is  large,  nose  obtuse, 
and  bent  upwards  ;  the  body  thick,  and  out  of  propor- 
tion to  the  general  size.  The  weight  of  the  Taimen 
reaches  144  lbs.,  with  large  but  watery  and  tasteless 
roe.  It  is  a  ravenous  fish,  that  preys  on  its  own 
species,  and  on  anything  it  can  secure. 

The  Sterlets  of  the  Nor-Zaisan  may  be  divided  into 
three  species :  **  Zaisanki,"  a  dark-greyish  fish,  with 
half  as  much  fat  as  flesh,  and  that  dry  and  coarse,  and 
equally  uncookable  as  the  black-skinned  Sturgeon  ;  its 

*  Of  oblong  shape,  its  entire  length  is  56  miles,  the  mean  width 
13  miles,  and  its  area  700  square  miles,  or  three  times  that  of  Geneva, 
though,  unlike  the  Swiss  lake,  its  depth  extends  only  from  22  to  26, 
increasing  in  some  places  to  40  feet.  In  former  years  the  lake  was  of 
greater  extent,  as  indicated  by  the  existence  of  sand  hillocks  at  a 
considerable  distance  from  the  present  shore,  and  by  the  low  neigh- 
bouring land  being  largely  overgrown  with  reeds.  Its  level  rises  from 
the  middle  of  June  to  the  end  of  July.  The  waters  of  the  Zaisan  are 
transparent,  fresh,  soft,  and  good  for  cooking  purposes,  but  of  a 
reddish  colour  in  deep  pools.  The  bottom  of  the  lake  is  in  some  parts 
clay,  and  in  others  mixed  with  small  pebbles,  with  white,  yellow,  red, 
and  blue  varieties  of  quartz.  The  shells  of  small  moUusks  are  found  in 
the  sands  of  the  shore,  and  between  certain  points  large  quantities  of 
stone,  of  the  size  of  a  pigeon's  egg,  are  washed  up  from  the  bottom  of 
the  lake,  and  overgrown  with  fine  green  moss.  About  a  dozen  head- 
lands from  the  mountains  run  out  into  the  lake,  which  has  three  islands, 
bearing  names,  and  many  nameless  ones  besides,  all  covered  with 
reeds.    The  lake  receives  the  drainage  of  ten  rivers.

weight  is  generally  from  36  to  72  lbs.  "  Golovashki," 
similar  to  the  preceding,  weighing  from  6  to  20  lbs., 
and,  like  it,  caught  in  the  Upper  Irtish,  but  rarely, 
met  with  in  the  Lower.  The  third,  which  is  the 
ordinary  Sterlet,  weighing  from  5  to  20  lbs.,  has  a 
light-greyish  skin,  and  its  flesh  is  soft,  rich,  and  of 
agreeable  flavour.  The  Sturgeon  and  Sterlet  remain 
in  the  lake  during  winter,  and  descend  the  river  to 
spawn  in  the  middle  of  May.  They  are  then  caught 
at  the  mouth  of  the  Irtish  until  the  13th  June;  but 
from  that  date  to  the  27th  July,  the  quantity  taken 
is  inconsiderable.  The  great  catches  are  in  April  and 
May.* 

Except  for  fishing  and  hunting  there  is  no  navigation 
on  Lake  Zaisan,  and  there  are  few  habitations  on  its 
banks.  In  the  reeds  around  are  numerous  wild  boars, 
which  feed  on  the  roots  of  the  Arundo  CalamagrostiSy 
a  coarse  grass  called  Koga  by  the  Kalmuks.  Otters 
are  also  numerous,  and  large  herds  of  Saigas  {Antilopa 
Saiga),  whilst  the  immediate  neighbourhood  of  the 
lake  is  frequented  by  Swans,  Geese,  Ducks,  Cormorants, 
Pelicans,  Snipe,  Plovers,  Bustards,  and  Pheasants. 

Concerning  the  geology  and  mineral  products  of  the 
neighbourhood  of  the  Zaisan  and  the  province  gene- 
rally, it  may  be  remarked  that  13  miles  from  the 
Koldjur  river  stands  a  large  rock  called  the  tuetash, 

*  So  long  ago  as  1803  the  Siberian  Cossacks  had  a  fishing  station  on 
Nor-Zaisan,  the  fishing  season  generally  commencing  in  the  middle  of 
May  and  ending,  on  the  lake,  early  in  September.  Salted  fish  and 
roe  were  despatched  for  sale,  ice-cellars  and  dep6ts  being  established 
for  this  purpose  at  Krasnoiarsk,  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  Semipolatinsk, 
and  Omsk.  The  revenue  derived  for  the  benefit  of  the  Cossacks,  from 
1842  to  1845,  amounted  to  ;^20,ooo ;  in  1865,  the  profit  arising  to  the 
troops  from  their  monopoly  was  j^i,50o;  and,  later,  R6clus  quotes 
the  ''  caisse  des  Cosaques  "  as  giving  the  annual  catch  of  fish  at  640 
tons.

that  presents  from  a  distance  the  appearance  of  a 
camel.  Near  this  there  exudes  a  slight  stream  of 
petroleum,  containing  sulphuric  acid,  with  earthy  and 
resinous  matter.  Again,  seven  miles  below  the  Koba 
rivulet,  that  falls  into  the  Upper  Irtish  from  the  right 
bank,  stands  a  hill  bearing  the  name  of  Achudasta 
Mountain,  formed  of  horizontal  layers  of  ochre,  varying 
in  colour  from  dark  red  to  yellow  and  white. 

The  local  Kirghese  prepare  achudas  or  alum  from 
the  red  ochre,  and  also  find  the  alum  in  a  crystal- 
lized state  {alumen  nativum  cristalltsatum).  They  use 
this  mineral  in  colouring  their  wares.  Saltpetre  also 
is  said  to  be  found  in  the  neighbourhood.  Hillocks  of 
varied  stratification,  like  the  Achudasta  hills,  are  numer- 
ous, particularly  in  the  direction  of  the  Altai,  along  the 
right  side  of  the  Irtish,  as  well  as  along  the  Kurchumu 
rivulet,  near  the  Irtish,  and  on  the  right  side  of  the  Zaisan. 
Near  the  source  of  the  Ku-Irtish  is  said  to  be  a  hill  of 
solid  stone,  from  which  naphtha  is  discharged,  and 
about  ID  miles  from  the  Kara  Irtish,  between  the 
rivers  Burchun  and  Koba,  is  a  small  saline  lake,  the 
salt  deposited  on  its  banks  being  used  for  cooking  by 
Kalmuks  and  Kirghese.  Between  the  same  rivers, 
but  20  miles  from  the  Irtish,  is  a  hill  of  mica,  the 
gleam  of  which  in  fine  weather  may  be  seen  for  half-a- 
dozen  miles.  In  former  years  this  mica  was  trans- 
ported for  sale  to  Semipolatinsk  and  elsewhere.  There 
are  no  volcanoes  now  active  in  the  district,  but  Dr. 
Finsch  thinks  that  the  Manrak  rocks  show  distinct 
signs  of  plutonic  origin. 

In  the  extreme  south-east  corner  of  the  province 
the  chief  constituents  of  the  hills  are  porphyry,  argil- 
laceous ironstone,  and  diabase,  or  some  kind  of  green- 
stone.    In  the  precipitous  gorges  and  narrow  ravines 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  SEMIPOLATIXSK,  93 

may  be  seen  veins  of  quartz,  displaying  white,  green, 
and  red  bands.  The  spurs  consist  of  yellow  sand 
and  marl,  from  which  issue  warm  springs.  Mineral 
springs  also  exist  at  the  southern  extremity  of  the 
Makran  hills,  and  near  the  springs  stands  a  Buddhist 
temple.  The  Chinese  at  one  time  had  recourse  to 
this  spot  for  curing  various  maladies,  and  likewise  held 
in  great  esteem  two  mineral  springs  issuing  from  a 
small  mound  near  the  source  of  the  Arasan  Koba 
rivulet.  The  water  of  both  is  cold  and  white  as  milk, 
one  spring  being  used  by  men  and  the  other  by  women. 
Gold  is  worked  in  the  Kalbinsk  range,  and  the  mineral 
products  of  the  northern  part  of  the  province  are  silver, 
copper,  rich  iron  ores,  and  coal,  whilst  about  Semipola- 
tinsk  the  formation  is  quartz,  and,  higher  up  the  river, 
of  slate.  Alexander  Schrenk  mentions  felsite  and 
hornstone  porphyry,  as  well  as  greywacke.  The 
ordinary  formations  on  the  Tas-Tau  are  sandstones  and 
schistose  rocks  belonging  to  the  Carboniferous  period. 
Its  peaks  are  of  dolomite,  whilst  the  rocks  are  largely 
composed  of  granite,  syenite,  and  porphyry.  Russian 
explorers  have  found  in  the  ravines  of  the  southern 
slopes  of  the  Tarbagatai  great  blocks  of  copper  ore 
and  veins  of  iron  ore. 

The  forests  of  the  province  of  Semipolatinsk  occupy 
about  4,000  square  miles,  or  2  J  per  cent,  of  the  whole 
superficies.  The  conifers  are  distributed  in  six  prin- 
cipal groups  widely  apart,*  but  the  foliferous  trees, 
chiefly  poplars  and  willows,  do  not  grow  in  woods,  but 

•  I.  Between  the  right  bank  of  the  Irtish  from  Semipolatinsk  to 
Pavlodar  and  the  Tomsk  frontier  are  pine  woods,  sometimes  sparse, 
growing  in  sandy  soil.  This  group  constitutes  the  chief  wood  reserve 
of  the  province.  2.  In  the  upper  valleys  of  the  Bukhtarma  and 
Kurchum  rivers,  principally  on  the  northern  slopes  of  the  mountains, 
are  dense  larch  woods.    3.  In  the  eastern  part  of  the  Kalbinsk  moun-

in  small  groups  and  lines  on  the  banks  and  islands  of 
the  rivers.  Near  Lake  Zaisan  are  arborescent  shrubs 
with  almost  white  leaves,  resembling  Eleagnus  hortensis, 
and  roses,  and  in  the  salt  soil  abundance  of  Tschingin, 
a  long-stalked  plant,  the  favourite*  food  of  the  camel. 
Bulbous  plants,  especially  of  the  Iris  tribe,  are  very 
common. 

In  the  same  neighbourhood  wild  animals  abound, 
including  the  Tiger,  Leopard,  Lynx,  Cat,  Bear,  Wolf, 
Fox,  Corsac  Fox,  Wolverine,  Badger,  Beaver,  Marten, 
Squirrel,  Siberian  Weasel,  Mole,  and  Ermine. 

The  domestic  animals  are :  low  set,  but  extremely 
hardy  Horses,  two-humped  Camels,  fairly  large  horned 
cattle  with  short  horns,  goats,  and  sheep.  The  last 
are  both  white  and  black,  and  of  that  peculiar  genus 
known  as  the  fat-tailed  sheep.  The  weight  of  the 
animal  varies  from  140  to  180  lbs.,  the  cushion  of  fat 
weighing  about  a  fourth  of  the  whole.  This  pad  of  fat 
disappears  by  cross-breeding  with  Russian  sheep. 
The  nose  is  arched,  the  ears  pendent,  and  the  fleece, 
that  is  less  used  for  weaving  than  making  thread,  is 
coarse,  and  the  wool  hairy.  The  horns  of  the  rams 
are  spiral. 

The  chief  races  inhabiting  the  province  are  Tatars, 
on  the  right  bank  of  the  Irtish,  north  of  Semipolatinsk ; 
Kirghese  on  the  left  bank,  and  to  the  south-west  of 
that  river,  and  along  the  banks  of  the  water-courses ; 
and  between  Semipolatinsk  and  the  Altai,  Russians ; 
the  average  number  of  persons  of  both  sexes  in  1879 
being  2|  to  the  square  mile. 

tains  are  here  and  there  pine  woods,  principally  on  the  almost  inacces- 
sible granite  rocks.  4.  Sparse  larch  woods  occur  at  the  sources  of  the 
rivers  Djemeni,  Kenderlik,  Chidone,  and  Chogan-Obo,  also  on  the  Saur 
mountains,  and  at  the  Zaisan  station.  5.  In  Baianaul  stanitsa,  and  6, 
at  Karkarali,  are  small  pine  woods  growing  on  the  granite  rocks.

The  towns  of  the  four  uyezds,*  into  which  the  pro- 
vince is  divided,  and  that  give  their  names  to  their 
respective  districts,  are,  with  one  exception,  on  the 
banks  of  the  Irtish  or  its  affluents.  Pavlodar  I  have 
already  alluded  to.  The  others  are  Semipolatinsk,  the 
capital,  597  feet  above  the  sea  level ;  Karkaralinsk, 
in  the  south-west,  at  an  altitude  of  2,698  feet ;  and 
Ust-Kamenogorsk,  at  an  altitude  of  711  feet,  in  the 
south-east.  Besides  these  should  be  mentioned  in 
the  mountains,  the  town  of  Kokpeti,  1,927  feet  high, 
Zaisan  Post,  at  an  altitude  of  2,200  f^et,  and  Bukh- 
tarma,  alluded  to  by  Atkinson  as  a  somewhat  imposing 
town,  and  where  one  of  the  early  Russian  forts  was 
built,  but  which  seems  now  to  have  declined  in  impor- 
tance. 

Thus  far  I  have  dwelt  upon  the  natural  features 
of  the  Semipolatinsk  province.  I  have  now  to  treat 
of  its  economy. 

♦  The  four  uyezds  and  one  sub-district  are  said  to  be  peopled  as 
follows,  but  the  totals,  in  every  case  but  one,  are  wrongly  calculated : —

WHEN  crossing  Siberia  in  1879  I  had  no  concep- 
tion, until  I  reached  the  end  of  my  journey, 
of  the  minuteness  with  which  the  governors  of  provinces 
transmit  to  head-quarters  the  affairs  of  the  most  distant 
corners  of  the  Empire.* 

The  statistics  first  accorded  to  me  in  the  govern- 
ment chancelleries  at  Vladivostock,  were  to  my  mind 

♦They  report,  for  instance,  as  to  i.  Agriculture,  the  system  pursued, 
and  by  whom,  together  with  the  kinds  and  quantities  of  crops  sown  and 
reaped ;  the  kinds,  number,  places,  and  circumstances  of  breeding  of 
cattle ;  the  sustenance  of  the  people,  their  industries  and  manufactures ; 
trade,  with  the  number,  kinds,  and  value  of  wares  purchased  and 
sold :  together  with  the  increase  or  decrease,  ranks,  and  religions 
of  the  population.  2.  Taxes,  duties,  and  personal  liabilities  with  their 
administration.  3.  The  social  welfare  of  the  people,  public  morality 
and  public  buildings,  fires,  and-post  houses.  4,  Health  of  the  people, 
number  of  hospitals,  doctors,  patients,  diseases,  epidemics  and  epi- 
zootics, together  with  circumstances  attending  violent  and  accidental 
deaths ;  prisons  and  benevolent  institutions.  5.  National  education, 
schools,  etc.

little  short  of  a  revelation,  and  I  began  to  suspect 
that  I  was  learning  secrets  ;  but  when  I  asked  for  the 
like  information  in  Central  Asia,  the  usual  courtesy  of 
the  Russian  officials  granted  my  request ;  and  not  only 
so,  but  the  new  report  for  the  government  of  Semipo- 
latinsk  for  the  preceding  year  (1881)  being  not  quite 
ready  at  the  time  of  my  visit,  it  was  subsequently 
forwarded,  most  obligingly,  to  my  English  address,  so 
that  I  became  supplied  with  the  latest  and  most  trust- 
worthy statistics  relating  to  the  province.  Should  these 
statistics  appear,  here  and  there,  to  overburden  this 
and  the  following  chapters,  I  would  beg  the  reader's 
indulgence,  promising  that  it  shall  not  occur  again,  if 
only  for  the  simple  reason  that  for  no  province  to  be 
described  hereafter  do  I  possess  equal  stores  of  in- 
formation. I  hope,  moreover,  here  to  give  my  readers 
such  an  illustration  as  I  have  never  seen  in  English, 
of  a  part  of  the  economy  of  what  was,  till  quite  recently, 
an  ordinary  Siberian  province,  with  the  fulness  of  which 
information  he  may  perchance  be  as  much  surprised 
as  I  was. 

To  begin,  then,  with  agriculture.  In  the  extreme 
west  of  the  Kirghese  Steppe,  about  Orenburg,  the  50th 
parallel  of  north  latitude  is  the  southern  limit  of  agri- 
culture without  irrigation.  Td  the  east,  in  the  province 
of  Semipolatinsk,  this  limit  is  on  the  53rd  parallel, 
north  of  which  there  is  only  an  unimportant  part  of 
the  province,  consisting  chiefly  of  basins  enclosing  saline 
lakes,  where  the  soil  is  too  much  impregnated  with  salt 
to  be  profitable  for  tillage.* 

•  The  remainder  of  the  province,  consisting  of  more  than  130,000 
square  miles,  is  scantily  watered,  with  the  exception  of  the  mountainous 
districts  and  certain  vast  tablelands,  that  from  their  altitude  intercept 
the  south-west  winds,  and  so  contribute  to  the  fall  of  rain  and  snow, 
and  consequently  the  formation  of  rivers  and  brooks.    The  only  welU

The  Kirghese  learnt  from  the  Chinese  how  to  irrigate 
the  land  by  damming  up  the  mountain  streams  and 
drawing  off  the  water  in  canals.  The  nomads  thus 
water  about  75  per  cent,  of  their  fields,  and  with  better 
results  than  the  settlers  obtain  who  occupy  those  parts 
of  the  province  suited  to  ordinary  agriculture.  By 
both  the  land  is  left  fallow  to  recuperate  its  powers,  and 
neither  uses  manure  ;  the  settler  because  his  fields  are 
usually  too  far  distant  from  his  homestead,  and  the 
nomad  because  manure  is  his  principal  fuel.  The  pre- 
dominating cereal  grown  throughout  the  province  is 
spring  wheat,  and  next  oats,  then  millet  (chiefly  among 
the  nomads),  barley,  and  spring  rye.  In  the  year  of 
my  visit,  it  was  intended  to  sow  at  the  Zaisan  station 
winter  wheat  obtained  from  the  Chinese  in  the  Emil 
valley,  with  the  hope  that  it  would  yield  a  better  crop, 
being  less  exposed  than  spring  corn  to  the  ravages  of 
grasshoppers  and  locusts.  These  latter,  according  to 
Lebedour,  belong  to  the  species  Grillus  Biguttatus 
and  Grillus  Clavimanus* 

Agriculture  constitutes  the  chief  pursuit  of  the  settled 
rural  population  of  the  districts  of  Ust-Kamenogorsk, 
Zaisan,  and  parts  east  of  the  capital,  but  in  the  re- 
watered  districts  are  those  of  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  with  its  Alpine  scenery 
to  the  east,  and  the  Kalbinsk  range  to  the  west.  The  Tarbagatai 
range  induces  an  incomparably  smaller  deposit  of  atmospheric  moisture, 
and  the  soil  of  the  scattered  eminences  in  the  western  and  south- 
western parts  of  the  province  is  too  rocky  for  agriculture.  Even  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  mountain  peaks  and  high  slopes,  where  more  rain 
falls,  the  surface  is  often  either  rocky  or  else  too  much  exposed  to  the 
early  autumn  winds,  whilst  at  the  foot  of  the  mountains,  where  the  soil 
would  allow  of  tillage,  the  rainfall  is  insufficient,  without  the  assistance 
of  irrigation. 

•  In  the  Alexandroff  volost  alone,  during  the  season  of  1880,  the 
locusts  destroyed  more  than  4,400  acres  of  corn,  and  grasshoppers 
appeared  in  large  numbers  in  the  Ust-Kamenogorsk  district  and  at 
Zaisan  station.

mainder  of  the  province  it  is  little  developed.  The 
corn  raised  is  almost  entirely  for  home  use.  The  fairly 
satisfactory  harvest  of  1880  provided  a  normal  quantity 
of  seed  for  i88i  ;  but  the  small  snow-fall  told  badly 
upon  fields  not  irrigated,  because  in  so  dry  a  climate 
the  successful  germination  of  the  spring  corn  chiefly 
depends  upon  the  abundance  of  moisture  from  the 
melting  snow.  During  the  spring  and  first  half  of  the 
summer,  little  rain  fell,  and  to  make  matters  worse,  in 
some  districts,  the  locusts  and  caterpillars  appeared,  so 
that  throughout  the  whole  province  there  was  only  a 
3i-fold  harvest  of  wheat,  and  a  3I  one  of  oats.  The 
total  wheat  harvest  amounted  to  52,484  quarters  (40,626 
less  than  in  1880),  and  of  oats  to  22,548  (12,017  less 
than  in  1880),  of  which  total  a  full  half  was  gathered 
by  the  nomads.  Of  potatoes  (planted  exclusively  by 
the  settlers)  a  seven-fold  crop  was  reckoned  satis- 
factory.* 

About  the  capital  the  harvest  barely  sufficed  for 
seed :  in  Pavlodar  less  corn  was  harvested  than  was 
sown,  whilst  the  highest  average  was  less  than  a  five- 
fold crop — ^a  difference  verily  from  England,  where  a 
farmer  in  the  Weald  of  Kent  tells  me  they  sow  i\ 
bushels  to  the  acre,  and  in  a  good  year  look  for  a  twelve- 
fold yield !     Things,  however,  in  Semipolatinsk  right

themselves  by  the  convenient  circumstance  that  just 
over  the  south-west  frontier,  in  the  neighbourhood  of 
Biisk  and  Barnaul  (the  happy  land  where,  in  1879,  I 
found  good  black  earth  letting  at  3^^.  an  acre),  the 
peasants  can  easily  grow,  in  a  year,  five  times  as  much 
corn  as  they  can  eat,  and  when,  in  1881,  the  crop  of 
their  neighbours  so  completely  failed,  the  official  report 
says  it  **  had  no  particularly  bad  consequences."  The 
reserves  of  the  Tomsk  district  amply  sufficed  for  the 
emergency,  and  "  there  was  not  even  an  extraordinary 
rise  in  the  price  of  corn/'* 

The  Cossacks  are  great  gardeners  ;  or,  at  least,  their 
wives  are  ;  the  husbands  also  being  sometimes  driven 
thereto  by  lack  of  other  work.  They  grow  tobacco, 
water  and  other  melons,  and  hemp.  The  crop  for  1881 
was  197  tons  of  tobacco;  of  hemp,  53  tons;  seeds  of 
flax  and  other  oleaginous  plants,  16  tons  ;  and  1,298,300 
melons.  The  tobacco  is  of  inferior  quality,  but  suited 
to  local  taste.  In  1879  the  province  yielded  292  tons  ; 
and  in  1880,  243;  but  the  official  return  for  1881 
was  only  194.  This  last  figure,  however,  is  judged 
to  be  too  low,  because  of  the  male  Kirghese  and 
Cossacks,  the  former  all  'snuff,'  and  the  latter  all  smoke, 
and,  since  no  importation  took  place,  their  estimated 
requirements  of  486  tons  must  have  been  supplied  by 
local  culture.  The  Cossacks  make  much  of  their  hay, 
selling  the  surplus  in  towns,  especially  in.  Pavlodar, 
or  to  the  Kirghese.  The  poor  or  thriftless  Cossack 
sells  his  crop  on  the  ground;  but  the  rich  reap  for 
themselves,  or  with  the  help  of  the  Kirghese,  paying 

♦The  Cossack  and  settled  populations  even  stocked  their  com  re- 
serves, as  usual  in  other  parts  of  the  Empire,  as  a  precaution  against 
famine.  In  1880  there  were  in  the  province  69  store-houses,  and  at  the 
end  of  1 88 1  there  remained  available  2,354  quarters  of  corn,  besides 
6,634  quarters  due  on  account  of  loans  or  arrears.

in  wages,  or  in  kind  with  a  third  or  half  the  crop.  The 
dry  season  of  1881  was  unfavourable  for  hay,  and 
though  65,000  tons  were  cut  by  the  settlers,  which  was 
one-fourth  in  excess  of  the  preceding  year,  it  did  not 
suffice  to  feed  the  herds  without  breaking  in  upon  the 
reserves. 

Cattle-breeding  constitutes  the  chief  means  of  subsist- 
ence, not  only  of  the  nomads  (who  form  more  than 
89  per  cent,  of  the  population),  but  also  of  a  certain 
portion  of  the  settled  inhabitants  of  the  province,  espe- 
cially about  Karkarali  and  Pavlodar,  where,  to  a  great 
extent,  the  climate  and  soil  are  unsuitable  for  agricul- 
ture. No  attempt  is  made  to  improve  the  breed  of  the 
Steppe  cattle,  the  settlers  conducting  their  operations 
partly  on  the  Kirghese  system,  with  this  difference, 
that  instead  of  sheep,  which  constitute  the  first  article  of 
Kirghese  management,  their  attention  is  chiefly  devoted 
to  horned  cattle,  though  making  less  of  milk  produce 
than  the  nomads.  According  to  official  information, 
the  number  of  beasts  in  the  province  in  18S0  amounted 
in  all  to  3,081,082.

But  only  in  regard  to  the  herds  of  the  settled  popula- 
tion are  these  data  even  approximately  correct.  The 
official  report  says  the  figures  for  the  Kirghese  herds  are 
far  too  small.  This  statement  is  based  upon  the  calcu- 
lation that,  according  to  the  Kirghese  returns,  computed 
with  reference  to  their  population,  it  would  appear  that 
they  profess  to  have  only  for  each  kibitka,  or  tent, 
664  head  of  large,  and  21  head  of  small  cattle,  the 
equivalent,  that  is,  to  48  sheep;  whereas,  for  food 
alone,  each  nomad  family  require  yearly  not  less  than

54  small  cattle.*  With  the  breeding  of  cattle  should  be 
noticed  the  keeping  of  bees,  that  has  long  existed  in 
the  Cossack  villages  of  the  Ust-Kamenogorsk  district, 
where,  however,  notwithstanding  numerous  facilities, 
agriculture  has  not  progressed  so  much  as  might  have 
been  expected.  The  year  1881  was  favourable  to  the 
interests  of  1 80  beekeepers,  who  had  5,217  hives  (1,830 
remaining  over  from  the  preceding  year),  from  which 
were  taken  27J  tons  of  honey  and  2 J  tons  of  wax. 

The  abundance  of  live  stock,  copper  mines,  glauberite 
and  common  salts  in  the  province  would  suggest   a 

*  The  untnistworthiness  of  the  figures  is  further  apparent  if  the  districts 
be  taken  separately ;  for  then  in  the  Karkaralinsk  district,  the  richest 
of  the  province  in  cattle,  each  kibitka  is  returned  as  possessing  only  at 
the  rate  of  44  sheep.  Information  respecting  the  number  of  the  Kir- 
ghese  herds  is  collected  triennially,  on  the  enumeration  of  the  tents, 
and  is  based  upon  the  reports  of  the  Kirghese  themselves,  without  any 
check.  Now  up  to  1869  a  tax,  called  thtyasak,  was  imposed  upon  the 
herds  in  Akmolinsk  and  Semipolatinsk ;  the  nomads  therefore  found  it 
advantageous  to  return  as  few  heads  of  cattle  as  possible,  and  though 
the  impost  no  longer  exists,  the  nomads  do  not  yet  believe  fully  in  the 
irrevocable  abrogation  of  theyasak,  and  so  retain  the  practice  of  under- 
statement. But  whilst  a  Kirghese  gives  the  smallest  figure  for  his  own 
herds,  he  has  no  objection  to  tell  the  truth  about  those  of  his  neighbours, 
so  that  it  is  not  difficult  to  find  out  on  separate  occasions  to  what 
extent  the  official  figures  diifer  from  the  actual.  After  comparing  all 
available  data  regarding  this  difference  in  1881,  it  was  judged  by  the 
Russians  that,  in  order  to  have  figures  nearer  the  truth  concerning  the 
Kirghese  herds,  it  was  necessar}'  to  multiply  the  nomad  returns  by  three 
for  the  Karkaralinsk  and  Zaisan  districts,  and  by  two  for  the  rest  of  the 
province.  For  camels,  however  (which  had  never  been  taxed),  it  sufficed 
to  increase  the  number  by  one-half.  The  following  amended  table  for 
the  province  in  1881  is  compiled  with  reference  to  the  above  considera- 
tions : —

possibility  of  the  local  development  of  tanning,  fur 
dressing,  stearine,  soap-boiling,  soda,  and  copper 
smelting  trades  ;  but  up  to  the  present,  from  want 
of  enterprise,  not  one  of  these  branches  of  industry 
has  Been  vigorously  commenced.-  Skin-dressing  is 
carried  on  in  a  few  works  resembling  trade  establish- 
ments, but  both  the  quality  and  quantity  of  work  are 
of  small  account.  During  1880  and  1881  the  produc- 
tion of  hides  decreased  45  per  cent.  Copper-smelting, 
which  began  to  acquire  a  certain  development  20 
years  ago,  has  fallen  away  of  late  years,  and  in  1881 
ceased  entirely  on  the  winding  up  of  the  affairs  of 
Messrs.  Popoff,  who  for  a  long  time  kept  in  their 
hands  the  greater  part  of  the  mines  in  the-  Pavlodar 
and  Karkaralinsk  districts.* 

The  gold  industry  that  has  long  been  carried  on  in 
the  Kalbinsk  mountains  was  as  productive  as  usual 
in  1 88 1,  notwithstanding  the  constantly  decreasing 
find  of  gold,  that  at  present  consists  there  of  \o\  dols 
to  the  100  poods  of  sand,  at  which  rate  eight  tons  of 
sand  would  need  to  be  washed  for  enough  gold  to 
make  a  sovereign.  So  poor  a  sand  is  worked  with 
profit  only  by  reason  of  the  cheapness  of  Kirghese 
labour,  and  of  provisions  brought  to  the  mines  from  the 
neighbouring  villages  of  Biisk.f 

*  In  1881  there  were  in  activity  67  works  (consisting  of  19  tanneries, 
5  soap  and  candle  works,  7  tallow  boileries,  i  oil  mill,  i  brewery, 
I  wire  and  i  pottery  manufactory,  and  32  brickfields),  the  whole  giving 
emplojrment  to  400  workmen,  and  producing  merchandise  to  the  value 
of  ;^43»257,  or  ;^i,oii  more  than  in  1880. 

t  In  1881  were  worked  31  mines,  and  526,716  tons  of  sand  washed 
(28,174  tons  more  than  in  1880) — as  much,  that  is,  as  would  cover 
Trafalgar  Square  to  a  depth  of  35  feet — and  therefrom  extracted  412  lbs. 
of  slich  gold  (25  lbs.  more  than  in  1880).  The  number  of  workers  was: — 
2,091  men,  of  whom  1,092  were  Kirghese  ;  178  women,  of  whom  22  only 
were  not  Kirghese,  and  127  children.  Of  the  workmen  engaged  (from 
a  distance)  36  did  not  think  fit  to  put  in  an  appearance  at  the  mines,

THE  PROVINCE  OF  SEMIP  OLA  TINS K.  105 

The  trade  of  the  province  is  to  some  degree  indi- 
cated by  the  number  and  quality  of  the  trading  certifi- 
cates granted  in  the  year  preceding  my  visit  to  3,217 
persons,  of  whom  only  three  took  first-class  guild 
merchants'  licences  and  34  first-class  tickets,  the 
remainder  being  licences  and  tickets  of  the  second 
guild  and  for  retail  traders,  carriers,  etc.,  the  whole  at

io6  jRUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

The  fair  trade  consists  chiefly  in  the  exchange  of 
manufactured  articles,  and  the  handiwork  of  the  settlers 
for  the  beasts  and  animal  products  of  the  nomads.  In 
1 88 1  the  nomads  brought  animals  and  their  products 
to  the  value  of  ;^  153,392  (;^32,o88  less  than  in  1880), 
for  which  they  took  away  goods  to  the  value  of 
;^87,898  (^8,148  more  than  in  1880),  the  remaining 
;^65,494  being  received  from  the  settled  population  in 
money.  An  increase  of  purchases  by  the  nomads,  as 
compared  with  the  previous  year,  was  observed  in 
grocery  and  colonial  goods,  metallic  wares,  corn,  and 
Central  Asian  textures  and  fruits,  and  a  decrease  in 
dressed  hides  and  peasant  productions.  Of  local  pro- 
ducts, there  was  an  increased  demand  for  oil  and 
tallow,  felt,  camlet,  sheep's  wool,  Korse-hair,  and  corn- 
chaff,  but  a  decrease  in  undressed  hides.  The  herds 
sold  were  considerably  smaller  (except  camels)  than  in 
1880,  the  decrease  being  due  to  the  fact  that  the 
Pavlodar  dealers  bought  a  large  number  of  flocks, 
chiefly  sheep,  direct  from  the  nomads,  so  that  the 
price  of  sheep  was  considerably  raised  at  the  fairs,  and 
fetched  on  an  average  6^.  5^.  each,  as  against  5^.  in 
1880.  For  horned  cattle  the  average  selling  price  was 
36^.  6^.,  and  for  horses  48^.  <^d.  each,  being  \s.  and 
3^.  2d.  respectively  less  than  in  1880.  It  should  be 
borne  in  mind,  however,  that  the  trade  at  fairs  em- 
braces only  a  small  portion  of  the  commerce  with  the 
Kirghese,  but  it  deserves  attention  because  it  furnishes 
the  population  with  the  means  of  effecting  trade 
exchanges  independently  of  the  powerful  **  middle 
man." 

With  regard  to  export  trade,  the  year  1881  not  only 
saw  the  apprehension  of  war  removed  between  Russia 
and  China,  but  also  the  conclusion  of  a  treaty  advan-

the  returns  of  the  Semipolatinsk  merchants  did  not 
show  much  increase,  in  all  probability  because  tran- 
quillity was  not  completely  restored  in  those  parts  of 
the  Chinese  Empire  bordering  on  Russian  territory, 
where,  moreover,  the  Manchu  officials  showed  them- 
selves by  no  means  favourably  disposed  to  the  increase 
of  Russian  sales.* 

The  population  of  the  province  of  Semipolatinsk  in 
1 88 1  consisted  of  290,312  males  and  248,073  females, 

®  The  majority  of  Semipolatinsk  merchants  trading  with  Chuguchak 
take  out  their  passports  in  Semirechia,  so  that  their  returns  do  not 
appear  in  the  statistics  of  their  proper  province.  Apart  from  these, 
however,  2i^  passports  were  granted  (41  in  1880),  and  a  like  number 
of  caravans  set  out — ^3  for  Chuguchak,  3  for  Guchen,  3  for  Kobdo, 
I  for  Shikho,  i  for  Urkashar,  and  21  for  the  valley  of  the  Black 
Irtish.  The  value  of  the  goods  exported  was  ;^25,5i9,  which, 
notwithstanding  the  unsettled  state  of  affairs  and  fewer  caravans,  was 
;^434  more  than  the  exports  of  1880.  The  goods  crossing  the  Chinese 
frontiers  and  their  values  respectively  were  : —

According,  however,  to  private  information,  144  tons  of  Chinese  silver 
currency  were  sent  to  Semipolatinsk,  representing  ;^  106,650  (credit),  of

or  together  538,385,  being  an  increase  on  the  previous 
year  of  7,665.  Divided  according  to  religious  beliefs, 
496,150  (or  92*16  per  cent.)  were  Muhammadans, 
41,875  (or  778  per  cent.)  were  of  the  Russian  Ortho- 
dox Church,  and  the  remainder  ('06  per  cent.)  con- 
sisted of  75  Raskolniks  or  dissenters,  86  Romanists, 
13  Protestants,  180  Jews,  3  Karaim  (Jews),  and 
3  Pagans.  Again,  divided  according  to  ranks, 
there  were  of  the  nobles  and  aristocracy,  including 
regular  and  Cossack  officers,  1,448  ;  Russian  clergy, 
171  ;  Muhammadan  mullahs  (exclusive  of  those  in  the 
Kirghese  vollosts),  82  ;  upper-class  citizens  and  mer- 
chants, 1,352  ;  bourgeois,  9,979  ;  peasants,  4,762  ; 
Cossacks,  23,177;  ordinary  soldiers,  4,732;  reserved, 
244  ;  retired,  with  their  families,  and  the  families  of 
soldiers  and  reserved,  2,647;  Kirghese,  489,134  (of 
whom  45  were  nobles  and  2,489  descendants  of 
** sultans"),  and  of  others  657.  Hence,  of  the  entire 
population,  the  classes  ranged  as  follows :  90*85  per 
cent,  were  Kirghese ;  then  followed  the  Cossacks, 
4*31  per  cent.;  bourgeois,  1*85  ;  peasants,  88;  and 
soldiers,  88.  Of  the  Kirghese  little  more  than  one- 
third  were  pure  nomads,  having  no  other  dwelling 
than  their  tents,  whereas  the  remainder  do  not  wander 
in  winter  from  their  fixed  quarters.  The  remaining 
57,431  (or  10*67  per  cent.)  constitute  the  settled  popu- 
lation, of  whom  34,547  (including  8,180  Kirghese) 
live  in  towns,  and  22,884  ^^  rural  districts.  The 
number  of  marriages  throughout  the  province  in  1881 
was  2,131  ;  births,  5,665  males  and  4,570  females,  or  a 
total  of  10,235,  of  whom  59  were  illegitimate  ;  deaths, 
6,680  males  and  4,457  females,  or  11,137,  leaving  a 
decrease  of  population  in  the  province  of  902.* 

*  The  foregoing  figures  are  founded,  so  far  as  the  town  of  Semi- 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  SEMIP  OLA  TINS K.  109 

Among  the  orthodox  population  there  were  419 
marriages,  2,019  births  (58  being  illegitimate),  and 
1,401  deaths,  or  3'35  per  cent.  Among  the  Muham- 
madan  town  population  there  were  166  marriages,  13 
divorces,  443  births,  and  606  or  4*23  per  cent,  of 
deaths.  Owing  to  the  inaccurate  method  of  registra- 
tion among  the  Muhammadan  population  of  the 
districts,  their  returns  are  not  worthy  of  credence  ; 
but  they  stand  at  1,546  marriages,  15  divorces,  7,77 2^ 
births  (including  i  illegitimate),  and  9,130  or  r68  per 
cent,  of  deaths.  The  number  of  ratable  persons  in 
the  towns  of  the  province  at  the  end  of  the  year  was 
4,534,  and  of  those  exempted  364  :  a  total  of  4,898, 
or  162  more  than  in  1880.  The  number  of  peasants 
was  1,103  ratable  and  8  exempt — a  total  of  1,1 11,  or 
8  less  than  in  1880,  whilst  the  Cossack  population  was 
augmented  by  4  men  and  decreased  by  2. 

The  settled  population  of  the  province,  excepting 
the  few  inhabitants  stationed  in  pickets,  farms,  mills, 
etc.,  inhabit   57   Cossack  villages,  5  peasant  hamlets, 

polatinsk  is  concerned,  on  a  census  taken  by  the  statistical  committee 
on  one  day  in  March,  1882;  for  the  other  towns  and  settled  rural 
populations,  on  the  lists  compiled  a  month  or  two  earlier  by  the  local 
police  authorities ;  but  for  the  Kirghese  population  of  the  districts, 
from  the  data  deduced  from  the  voUost  family  lists  compiled  in  1880. 
These  last  data,  says  the  report,  particularly  for  Zaisan  station,  cannot 
be  complete.  In  several  starchinstvos  or  sub-districts,  for  instance, 
the  number  of  females  is  returned  at  less  than  half  the  number  of 
males ;  so  that  these  data  would  show  throughout  the  province  only 
4*42  persons  to  each  Kirghese  kibitka,  whereas  on  all  occasions  when 
an  actual  census  of  the  Steppe  population  has  been  taken,  the  average 
number  of  Kirghese  of  both  sexes  to  each  kibitka  has  been  5. 
Reckoning,  then,  the  kibitka  at  5  persons,  the  Kirghese  population  of 
the  province  should  amount  to  553,080,  and  so  the  total  population  to 
602,331  of  both  sexes.  On  this  computation,  the  population  of  the 
districts  (excluding  the  towns  and  urban  settlements)  will  be  :  Semi- 
polatinsk,  128,752;  Pavlodar,  112,559;  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  72,658; 
Karkaralinsk,  148,871 ;  and  Zaisan  station  104,944.

Thus  far,  then,  I  have  dwelt  in  this  chapter  upon 
the  economy  of  the  province  with  respect  to  its  people 
and  their  occupations ;  in  the  following  one  I  purpose 
to  treat  of  its  administration.

THE  province  of  Semipolatinsk  enjoys  the  repu- 
tation of  having  been  punctual,  since  the 
establishment  of  the  present  regime  in  1869,  in  the 
payment  of  its  taxes.  This  is  attributed  to  the  class 
of  which  the  settled  population  is  composed,  and  to 
the  convenient  system  adopted  with  regard  to  the 
nomads.  The  unit  of  taxation  among  the  Kirghese 
is  the  kibitka,  each  of  which  pays  6i'.  a  year, 
and  the  enumeration  of  which  is  performed  every 
three  years  by  selected  men,  who  are  paid  for  the 
work  at  the  rate  of  ^\d.  per  tent.  The  towns- 
people pay  a  tax  on  property,  besides  which  the 
peasants  pay  a  land  tax  and  a  capitation  tax,  and  there 
are  certain  taxes  levied  besides  from  the  bourgeoisie. 
The  kibitka  tax  for  1881  amounted  to  £zo,^\T  \ 
property  tax,  ;^  1,011;  peasants'  land  and  capitation 
taxes,  ;^568;  and  from  the  bourgeois,  ;^ioi;  making  a 


112  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA 

sum  total  for  the  whole  province  of  ;^32,i87;  in 
addition  to  which  there  remained  in  arrears  £?>oy,  or 
£SZ^  l^ss  than  in  the  preceding  year.  Besides  this 
there  were  rates  raised  for  local  purposes  to  the 
amount  of  £22^^. 

The  different  kinds  of  excise  duties  collected 
amounted  to  ;^28,738,  made  up  of  ;^26,478  for  wine 
duty,  ;^i,968  for  licences,  and  for  tobacco  and  stamp 
licences  ;^292,  amounting  in  all  to  ;^8,367  less  than  in 
1880.  This  decrease  was  attributable  to  the  alteration 
of  the  excise  on  salt,  otherwise  the  returns  would  have 
shown  an  increase  of  ;^2,465  as  compared  with  1880. 
The  lands  in  the  province  paying  rent  to  the  Treasury 
consist  of  three  portions  near  the  capital — 503  acres  in 
all — bringing  in  an  annual  rental  of  ;^I2,  and  for 
timber  felled  £792^  or  ;^I92  more  than  in  1880. 

An  important  extent  of  land,  chiefly  on  either  side 
of  the  Irtish,  belongs  to,  or  is  occupied  by,  the  Cos- 
sacks. The  quit  rents  of  these  holdings  are  paid  into 
the  Cossack  fund.* 

Besides  the  taxes  just  mentioned  there  are  the 
vollost,  or  local  rates.  In  1881  the  Kirghese  paid 
;^  1 4, 9  5  8,  to  the  expenditure  of  which  I  shall  allude 
hereafter.  I  n  the  peasant  vollost,  of  i ,  1 1 1  souls, 
£27^  were  expended   thus  :   for   the  maintenance  of 

•  From  this  source  there  was  collected  in  1881,  rent  for  land,  ;f302  ; 
rent  of  mills  and  works,  ^^205  ;  licences  for  fishing  on  Zaisan  lake, 
;^379  ;  and;£'92  also  were  paid  into  the  Cossack  reserve  fund  as  salt 
duties.  The  total,  ;^978,  is  little  more  than  half  what  it  was  in  the 
previous  year.  In  the  eastern  part  of  the  province  is  situated  the 
Balagach  Steppe,  a  locality  specially  favourable  to  husbandry,  that  is 
readily  rented  by  agriculturists  in  the  capital,  in  the  surrounding 
Cossack  villages,  and  by  peasants  of  the  Alexandrovsk  vollost,  who 
have  no  arable  land.  In  this  district  and  the  mountain  land  generally, 
the  annual  rent  is  4^?.  per  acre  In  1881,  32,000  acres  were  let,  but  on 
account  of  the  failure  of  the  harvest  the  rents  collected  amounted  to 
;^40o  only,  as  against  £s^  the  year  before.

the  communal  administration.  £^TT  \  for  the  main- 
tenance of  the  school,  ;^30 ;  pay  of  the  parish  clergy, 
£^2\  and  for  yemstchiks,  or  postilions,  ;^ii6.  In  the 
Cossack  stanitzas  the  expenditure  for  public  purposes 
is  covered  by  the  receipts  obtained  from  various  lands, 
from  the  tolls  of  ferries,  etc.* 

Besides  the  payment  of  money,  the  inhabitants  of 
the  province  are  placed  under  certain  personal  lia- 
bilities as  to  obligatory  duties.  Military  service  is 
not  imposed  on  the  Kirghese ;  but  they  are  bound  to 
keep  roads  in  repair  (generally  compounded  for,  how- 
ever, by  public  convention,  and  not  done  in  person), 
to  furnish,  on  payment,  fuel,  tents,  and  sheep  to  military 
bodies  on  the  march,  and  also  to  let  on  hire  tents  and 
horses  to  functionaries  travelling  in  the  steppe  on 
public  service.! 

The  Cossacks  pay  no  taxes,  but  in  lieu  thereof  they 
undertake  military  and  other  kinds  of  service  on 
special  conditions,  t 

The  administration  of  the  military  liability  of  the 
other  classes  is  shown  thus  :  The  calling  up  began  on 
the  15th  October  and  ended  31st   December  (O.S.), 

*  At  the  beginning  of  1881  there  was  a  balance  in  hand  of  £i,y2q; 
besides  which  £i,7Si  were  subsequently  received,  and  ;^  1,431  ex- 
pended, leaving  a  surplus  towards  1882  of  £2,o^gj  of  which  ;^848  was 
in  cash,  and  jf  1,201  on  loan. 

t  In  1 88 1,  282  tents  were  thus  supplied  to  troops,  and  food  was 
requisitioned  to  the  extent  of  21  homed  cattle  and  1,052  sheep,  to  the 
value  of  £176.  Some  of  the  tents  were  furnished  without  payment,  by 
Kirghese  wandering  along  the  line  of  march,  but  the  majority  were 
paid  for  from  the  voUost  fund. 

X  In  1881,  3  officers  and  147  Cossacks,  or  1*27  per  cent,  of  the  male 
Cossack  population  (11,795),  were  called  to  active  service,  in  the  3rd 
cavalry  regiment,  whilst  of  the  other  classes  liable  to  military  service, 
the  number  entering  the  army  constituted  '49  per  cent,  of  the  male 
population.  The  other  liabilities  of  the  Cossacks  consisted  of  the 
furnishing  carts  (2,503  were  supplied  without  payment)  and  3,483  days' 
work  at  road  mending.

the  total  number  requisitioned  being  187.  Of  these 
49  were  designated  to  enter  the  service,  3  absented 
themselves  from  the  lot-drawing,  but  47  recruits  were 
taken,  and  two  were  discharged  by  purchase.* 

The  houses  and  public  buildings  of  the  Semipolatinsk 
province,  standing  midway  between  Central  Asia  and 
Siberia,  partake  of  the  characteristics  of  both.f  The 
cost  of  public  buildings  in  1881  to  the  civil  authorities 
was  ;^30i,  which  sum  must  appear  to  an  English  eye 
to  have  been  made  to  go  a  long  way;  for  it  included 
the  erection  of  offices  in  Pavlodar  and  a  guard-house 
on  the  Zaisan-Kokpety  road;  repairing  the  court- 
houses at  Pavlodar  and  Karkaralinsk ;  the  prisons  of 
Semipolatinsk,  Pavlodar  and  Usk-Kamenogorsk,  and 
the  lock-up  at  Karkarali,  besides  pickets  on  several  of 
the  steppe-roads.  Building  operations,  however,  were 
carried  on  to  a  much  greater  extent  by  the  military 
engineering  department,  the  total  expended  being 
;^3,226.t       The  buildings   of  the   province   suffered 

•  The  number  actually  drawn  consisted  of  45  fit  for  active  service,  2 
non-combatants,  3  who  entered  the  service  under  special  reg^ulations, 
and  2  entitled  to  short  service.  The  remaining  45  were  not  so  entitled. 
Socially,  the  47  (of  whom  only  14  could  read  and  write)  consisted  of  i 
upper-class  citizen,  4  merchants,  30  bourgeois,  11  peasants,  and  i 
other ;  or,  again,  taken  by  religious  professions,  they  consisted  of  31 
orthodox,  i  dissenter,  and  15  Muhammadans.  The  number  of  married 
was  14.  Besides  the  foregoing  it  should  be  observed  that,  during  the 
year,  125  were  sent  into  the  militia  of  the  province. 

t  Of  39  orthodox  religious  buildings  in  1881,  14  were  of  stone  and 
25  of  wood ;  of  other  religious  buildings,  2  were  of  stone  and  24  of 
wood.  There  were  in  the  province  52,472  inhabited  dwelling-houses 
of  stone  so  called,  of  which,  however,  20,055  were  of  daubed  clay ;  and 
21,719  of  wood.  There  were  also  uninhabited  142  stone  and  619  wooden 
houses,  making  the  total  number  of  buildings  throughout  the  province 
to  be  52,614  stone  and  mud  and  22,338  of  wood.  This  number  included 
the  Kirghese  winter  quarters,  comprising  64,208  buildings,  namely, 
12,372  of  wood,  31,781  of  stone,  and  20,055  of  clay. 

X  The  more  noteworthy  of  these  works  were  the  building  of  two  stone 
commissariat  magazines  for  corps  in  Semipolatinsk  (;^i,20o),  the  con-

heavily  in  1881  from  71  fires — ^an  increase  of  nearly 
50  per  cent,  on  the  previous  year.  The  destruction 
of  315  houses  and  yourts  (270  more  than  in  1880) 
and  2  forests  involved  a  loss  of  ;^  15,426 — an  excess 
of  *;^ 1 3*641  over  the  preceding  year.* 

The  health  of  the  people  was  cared  for  throughout 
the  province  by  a  staff  of  18  physicians  and  49  assistant 
surgeons,  of  whom  13  and  37  respectively  were 
military  ;  and  by  7  midwives.  The  medical  establish- 
ments were  9  in  number,  there  being  under  civil 
jurisdiction  in  Semipolatinsk  two  hospitals,  one  being 
free ;  and  under  military  jurisdiction,  6  hospitals  and  a 

"rest.''t 

version  of  a  coach-house  into  a  stable  for  the  horses  of  the  mounted 
mountain  battery  in  Usk-Kamenogorsk  (;^20i),  the  construction  of  a 
wooden  equipment-store  at  Zaisan  Post  (;£ 259),  and  the  construction  of 
a  wooden  stable  for  the  horses  of  the  West  Siberian  light  battery  at 
Zaisan  Post  (;^307),  etc.  As  connected  with  these  expenditures  in  the 
province  may  be  noticed  the  following  sums  received  and  expended 
during  the  year  in  its  four  principal  towns : —

•  Of  the  71  fires,  10  took  place  in  winter,  36  in  spring,  18  in  summer, 
and  7  in  autumn,  their  alleged  causes  being :  from  faulty  construction 
of  chimneys,  7  ;  from  carelessness,  28,  which  includes  the  burning  of 
2  forests;  from  lucifer  matches,  5  ;  and  31  from  causes  unknown.  It 
would  appear  that  throughout  the  province  the  only  towns  that  have 
anything  like  a  fire  brigade,  are  Semipolatinsk,  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  and 
Pavlodar,  the  former  two  spending  thereon  in  1881  the  sum  of  ;f456, 
whilst  the  fire-extinguishing  paraphernalia  of  the  six  towns  in  the 
province  amounts  to  2  under-officers>  25  workmen,  25  horses,  14  pumps, 
16  hose,  36  summer  and  24  winter  vehicles,  29  tubs,  44  pails,  12  ladders, 
53  hooks,  29  axes,  and  25  screens  or  sails. 

t  The  military  hospitals  were :  at  Semipolatinsk,  for  58  beds ;  Zaisan 
Post,  58  beds  ;  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  22  beds ;  Pavlodar,  6  beds ;  Karka-

The  Semipolatinsk  town-hospital  commenced  the 
year  with  9  patients,  81  were  admitted  later  on,  67 
discharged,  13  died,  and  7  remained,  whilst  454  out- 
patients paid  554  visits.  When  I  was  at  Semipolatinsk 
the  free  hospital  had  been  opened  a  little  more  than 
a  year.  During  the  first  seven  months  of  its  existence 
there  entered  226  male  and  205  female  patients,  of 
the  following  social  grades  : — Upper  classes,  20;  clergy, 
1 8 ;  merchants,  8  ;  bourgeois,  1 86 ;  peasants,  80 ; 
Cossacks,  14  ;  soldiers,  77  ;  Kirghese,  Sarts,  and 
Tatars,  28,  amongst  whom  the  chief  diseases  were  in- 
termittent fever,  mucous  diarrhoea,  rheumatism,  catarrh 
of  the  respiratory  organs,  diseases  of  the  abdominal 
organs,  inflammation  of  the  jaws,  abscesses,  eruptions, 
etc.* 

I  have  already  alluded  to  the  number  of  young 
recruits  who  are  sent  every  year  to  Turkistan.  Of 
these  there  were  in  the  hospitals  of  the  Semipolatinsk 
province,  at  the  commencement  of  the  year,  2  ;  there 
were  added  during  the  year,  122;  discharged,  1 20  ; 
died,  4  ;  whilst  of  the  lower  ranks  of  the  reserve  army 
there  was   in   hospital,  at   the  commencement  of  the 

ralinsk,  14  beds ;  Kokpety,  4  beds ;  and  Koton  Karagai,  6  beds.  In 
the  military  hospitals  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  the  patients,  a 
certain  proportion  being  civilians,  numbered  124,  and  there  were  subse- 
quently admitted  2,917.  Of  these  2,875  were  discharged,  59  died,  and 
107  remained  in  hospital  at  the  end  of  the  year.  The  number  of  out- 
patients attending  the  military  hospitals  was  12,947  ;  the  number  of 
their  visits,  25,274. 

*  The  chief  diseases  in  the  town  hospital  were :  typhus  and  typhoid 
fever,  9 ;  intermittent  fever,  7  ;  tuberculosis,  7 ;  venereal  diseases,  6 ;  and 
from  excessive  drinking,  6.  Of  13  deaths,  there  occurred  from  tuber- 
culosis, 7 ;  typhus,  2  ;  burning,  i ;  frost,  i  ;  dropsy,  i  ;  and  old  age, 
I .  The  patients  admitted  to  the  town  hospital  were :  nobles  and 
merchants,  5  ;  bourgeois  and  peasants,  19  ;  postal  employes,  3  ;  soldiers, 
reserve  and  serving,  14  ;  Kirghese,  18  ;  and,  in  addition,  5  children  and 
17  women,  of  the  last  of  whom  4  were  suffering  from  syphilis  and  4  from 
intermittent  fever.

year,  only  i  patient  :  7  were  added,  6  discharged,  and 
2  remained.* 

The  greatest  mortality  among  the  hospital  patients 
resulted  from  typhus,  and  next  from  inflammation  of 
the  lungs.  The  total  mortality  was  2*4  per  cent,  of 
the  number  of  patients. 

In  connection  with  the  foregoing  might  be  mentioned 
108  violent  and  accidental  deaths,  occurring  throughout 
the  province,  which  were  44  less  than  in  i88o.t 

A  large  number  of  deaths  by  burning  is  a  speci- 
ality of  nomad  life,  many  of  the  Kirghese  children 
being  scalded  by  the  overturning  of  kettles,  or  burnt 
by  the  ignition  of  their  clothes  from  the  fire  in  the 
midst  of  the  tent.  The  number  of  children  vaccinated 
by  physicians,  surgeons,  and  vaccination  pupils  was 
6,104,  the  operation  being  successful  in  4,259  cases. 

This  finishes,  then,  for  the  present,  the  ample  informal 
tioij  I  ventured  to  promise  the  reader  concerning  the 
Semipolatinsk  province,  in  which  I  have  endeavoured 
to  do  justice  to  the  minuteness  with  which  statistics  are 
gathered  and  forwarded  to  Petersburg  from  the  re-, 
motest  parts  of  the  Empire.  Of  course  the  question 
may  be  put.  Are  these  figures  trustworthy  ?  The  answer 
must  be  both  **Yes"  and  **  No."  When  asking  a 
governor  further  south  for  statistics,  he  replied  that 
they  had  been  able  to  gather  none,  the  Russian  popula- 

*  The  chief  diseases  in  the  militaiy  medical  establishments  were : 
intermittent  fever,  689 ;  local  diseases  of  the  urinary  organs,  313  ;  acute 
and  mucous,  and  in  some  cases  bloody,  diarrhoea,  146  ;  acute  catarrh 
of  the  respiratory  organs,  146  ;  rheumatism,  145  ;  venereal  diseases,  142; 
typhus,  136 ;  and  inflammation  of  the  lungs  and  pleurisy,  126. 

t  Of  violent  deaths,  5  were  murders  (19  less  than  the  year  preceding), 
6  were  suicides,  and  3  dead  bodies  of  infants  were  found.  Of  22 
sudden  deaths,  8  were  from  sickness,  and  12  from  unknown  causes ; 
whilst  of  72  accidental  deaths,  there  were  killed  by  lightning,  4  ;  by 
falling,  9  ;  drowned,  24;  frozen,  4,  and  burnt,  21.

tion  being  so  small  as  compared  with  that  of  the  natives, 
and,  moreover,  that  some  of  those  statistics  I  had  already 
received  were  of  little  worth.  This  admission  from  the 
mouth*  of  a  particularly  intelligent  Russian  General  at 
first  rather  startled  me,  but,  when  properly  explained, 
seemed  to  amount  to  this.  The  Russians,  being  few  in 
number  in  the  recently  annexed  provinces  of  Central 
Asia,  are  obliged  to  depend  for  information  upon  the 
natives.  Now  in  a  trustworthy  informant  we  look  for 
two  things  :  that  he  should  be  able  to  speak  the  truth, 
and  that  he  should  be  willing  to  do  so  ;  whereas  the 
natives  are  neither  one  nor  the  other,  as  I  speedily  dis- 
covered, when  surrounded  by  them  after  crossing  the 
Russian  frontier.  In  one  of  the  tribes  in  the  north- 
east of  Siberia,  a  man  wishing  to  express  the  number 
20  would  count  on  his  hands  and  toes,  but  beyond  this 
number  he  would  call  into  requisition  the  hands  and 
toes  of  a  second  man,  and  so  on  ad  libitum;  and  though 
I  do  not  affirm  that  the  Central  Asiatics  are  so  simple  as 
this,  yet  they  have  very  vague  ideas  of  high  numbers. 
Said  I  to  the  Bokhariot  officers  sent  out  to  meet  me 
as  I  approached  Charjui,  **  How  many  inhabitants 
does  that  town  contain?''  **A  million!"  was  the 
reply  ;  whereas,  had  the  man  said  30,000,  I  believe 
he  would  have  exceeded  the  mark — not,  I  think,  from 
design,  but  for  lack  of  power  to  grasp  the  meaning  of 
a  million.  So,  when  some  old  aksakal,  or  white-beard, 
is  brought  in  from  the  mountain  or  the  steppe  to  appear 
before  a  Russian  officer,  and  is  asked  the  number  of 
tents  in  his  district,  and  the  cattle,  it  is  no  great  wonder 
if  he  often  gives  an  unsatisfactory  answer. 

But  besides  the  question  of  incompetency,  I  have 
already  mentioned  the  unwillingness  of  the  natives  to 
let  the  Russians  know  their  affairs,  and  their  suspicions 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  SEMIPOLATINSK.  119 

that  the  gathering  of  statistics  is  only  a  prelude  to 
further  taxation.  "  How  many  cattle  has  your  father?  " 
said  I  to  the  son  of  a  Kirghese  dignitary,  and  forthwith 
the  answer  came,  "  150  horses,  500  sheep,  30  cows,  and 
20  camels,"  which  probably  was  not  far  wrong.  But 
shortly  after  I  mentioned  it  to  the  Russian  officer,  who 
referred  to  his  books  to  see  what  official  return  the 
father  had  made,  and  found  it  to  stand,  **  50  horses, 
150  sheep,  10  cows,  and  6  camels,"  from  which  ex- 
ample it  will  be  seen  how  native  statistics  are  to  be 
taken  cum  grano  salts.

HISTORICAL   SKETCH  OF  THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION 

OF  THE  IRTISH

THE  history  of  Russian  Central  Asia  may  be  con- 
veniently treated  under  the  general  divisions  of 
ancient  and  modern.  Its  ancient  history  includes  the 
struggles  of  Asiatics,  whose  rude  conquerors  approach- 
ing the  fray,  whether  from  the  highlands  of  the  east* 
or  from  the  lowlands  of  the  west,  brought  to  the  con- 
quered a  method  of  warfare,  and  manners  and  customs, 
not  greatly  dissimilar  to  their  own.  What  these  were 
the  reader  will  better  understand  and  appreciate  when 
in  the  course  of  our  narrative  we  have  travelled  further 
south. 

The  modern  history  of  Central  Asia,  however,  brings 
on  the  scene  a  conqueror  from  the  north,  a  European, 
with  a  strange  language  and  a  new  mode  of  warfare, 
who  advances  not  at  the  head  of  a  devastating  cavalry

column,  but  in  the  persons  of,  at  first,  a  mere  handful 
of  Cossacks,  who  make  their  way  up  the  rivers,  build- 
ing forts  as  they  go,  engaging  in  trade,  and  so  turning 
to  their  own  advantage  the  internal  feuds  of  the  enemy, 
that  he  is  at  length  surrounded  and  bidden  to  surrender. 
In  this  chapter  I  purpose  to  treat  of  so  much  of  the 
modern  history  of  Central  Asia  as  will  cover  the 
Russian  occupation  of  the  Irtish,  or,  in  other  words,  the 
country  through  which,  thus  far,  we  have  travelled. 

The  history  of  the  Russian  occupation  of  the  Irtish 
commenced  with  the  conquest  of  the  Tatars,  about  the 
mouths  of  the  Tura  and  Tobol,  and  was  followed  by 
the  series  of  events  that  brought  the  Russians  in 
contact  successively  with  the  Kalmuks  of  Sungaria,  the 
Chinese  of  Western  Mongolia,  and  to  some  extent  the 
Kazaks  of  the  Steppe. 

It  was  in  1579,  during  the  reign  of  John  the 
Terrible,  that  Yermak  crossed  the  Urals,  to  find  him- 
self opposed  by  Kuchum  Khan,  ruler  of  the  Siberian 
hordes  of  the  Irtish,  Tobol,  and  Barabinski  Tatars,  a 
lineal  descendant  of  Jinghis  Khan,  and  a  prince  of 
some  note,  who  had  been  the  first  systematically  to 
introduce  Muhammadanism  into  Siberia.  This  ruler 
Yermak  conquered,  in  1581,  in  a  series  of  battles,  one 
with  three  petty  Tatar  princes  near  the  mouth  of  the 
Tura,  another  near  the  mouth  of  the  Tobol,  and  a 
third  on  the  Irtish,  after  which  Kuchum  fled  from  his 
fort  Sibir,  and  on  the  7th  of  November  Yermak  took 
possession  of  his  capital. 

Several  of  the  surrounding  chiefs  tendered  their 
submission,  and  the  Russians  sailed  down  the  Irtish, 
capturing  numerous  forts;  but  in  the  spring  of  1584 
the  enemy  besieged  the  invaders  in  Sibir.  Yermak 
defeated  them,  and  then  sailed  up  the  Irtish,  where 


122  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

he  gained  possession  of  several  strongholds,  and  was 
returning  on  his  way  to  Sibir,  when,  having  learned 
that  a  caravan  from  Bokhara  was  crossing  the  I  shim 
Steppe  on  its  way  to  Kuchum  Khan,  he  halted  near 
the  River  Bagatai,  and  on  the  evening  of  the  17th 
August,  unaware  that  his  enemy  was  near,  lay  down 
with  his  companions  to  sleep,  without  so  much  as 
posting  sentinels.  The  troops  of  Kuchum  attacked 
the  sleepers,  and  though  Yermak  cut  his  way  to  the 
river,  yet  in  the  endeavour  to  step  into  his  boat  he  fell 
into  the  water  and  was  drowned,  whereupon  his  followers 
recrossed  the  Urals,  and  left  the  field  to  Kuchum. 

When  news  reached  Moscow  of  the  ease  with  which 
Yermak  had  gained  his  victories,  it  was  determined 
speedily  to  send  an  expedition  to  recover  lost  ground. 
On  the  10th  July,  1586,  a  new  Russian  force  reoccupied 
Tchingi-Tura,  one  of  Yermak's  first  conquests,  and 
founded  thereon  Tiumen.  which  became  the  first  per- 
manent Russian  settlement  east  of  the  Urals.  In  the 
following  year  Tobolsk  was  founded  near  the  Tatar 
Isker.  and  was  made  the  residence  of  the  first  voyevode, 
or  governor  of  Siberia.  The  Cossacks  had  little  diffi- 
culty in  subduing  the  neighbouring  tribes,  but  Kuchum, 
though  weakened,  was  not  dead.  He  had  been  living 
with  the  Tatars  in  the  Barabinski  Steppe,  east  of  the 
Irtish,  and  in  the  summer  of  1590  marched  to  the 
neighbourhood  of  Tobolsk,  to  be  beaten  again,  how- 
ever, the  next  year,  and  deprived  of  a  son  and  two  of 
his  wives.  Shortly  after  this,  in  1594,  and  in  order 
to  overawe  the  district  of  the  Upper  Irtish,  and  the 
Barabinski  Steppe,  as  well  as  to  restrain  Kuchum, 
Tara  was  built  on  the  Lower  Irtish  and  fortified. 

At  the  same  time,  according  to  instructions  from 
Moscow,  letters  were  sent  to  Kuchum   Khan,  inviting 


RUSSIAN"  OCCUPATION  OF  THE  IRTISH.  123 

him  to  come  to  terms,  but  since  he  remained  obdurate 
the  Russians  determined  to  crush  him.  Accordingly 
Cossack  troops  were  sent  against  his  remaining  forces, 
with  the  result  that  eight  of  his  wives,  five  sons  and 
daughters,  and  five  princes  fell  into  the  hands  of  the 
victors,  after  which  the  Tsar  Boris  Gudunoff  was  informed 
that  the  Russians  were  now  masters  of  Siberia.  Kuchum 
escaped  to  the  Upper  Irtish  to  the  Kalmuks,  and 
from  thence  he  went  to  the  I  shim  steppe,  where  it  is 
said  he  was  put  to  death  by  the  Nogais.  Thus  closes 
the  first  period  of  my  history,  a  term  of  20  years, 
during  which  the  Russians  were  chiefly  employed  in 
the  conquest  of  the  Tatars. 

The  fame  of  these  successes  brought  every  year  new 
subjects  to  the  Russian  Tsar.  Among  others  came 
Tayan,  prince  of  the  Barabinski  Tatars,  from  the  upper 
banks  of  the  Tom,  who  proceeded  to  Moscow  in  1604, 
and  presented  to  Boris  Gudunoff  a  petition,  asking  to 
be  received  with  all  his  family  as  Russian  subjects, 
proposing  the  construction  of  a  Russian  town  in  his 
territory,  and  promising  to  assist  in  inducing  the  neigh- 
bouring peoples  to  submit  to  the  Tsar's  sovereignty, 
Tayan's  proposal  was  accepted,  and  the  said  town 
founded  the  same  year  on  the  right  bank  of  the  Tom> 
and  hence  called  Tomsk.  The  road  thereto  lay 
through  Tara,  which  dominated  the  Barabinski  Steppe, 
and  served  as  an  intermediate  station  between  Tobolsk 
and  Tomsk,  as  also  a  means  of  communication  with 
the  advanced  posts  up  the  Irtish,  where  lived  the 
Sungarian  Kalmuks,  the  next  people  whose  contact 
with  Russia  we  are  to  notice. 

For  fully  a  century  after  the  conquest  of  Kuchum, 
the  invaders  on  the  Irtish  did  little  more  than  hold 
what  they  were  pleased  to  call  their  own,  for  the  natives 


124  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

did  not  leave  them  alone.  In  1609  the  Tatars,  Voguls, 
and  Ostiaks  endeavoured  to  plunder  Tiumen,  and  in 
the  following  year  the  Nogai  Tatars  devastated  the 
country  around.  Nor  was  the  onslaught  of  arms  the 
only  difficulty  with  which  the  Russians  had  to  contend. 
Three  times  in  the  century  the  wooden  town  of  Tobolsk 
was  destroyed  by  fire,  and  in  1638  it  was  inundated  by 
floods.  The  native  tribes,  nevertheless,  continued  to 
offer  submission,  and  Russian  influence  was  strength- 
ened by  the  opposing  native  factions,  each  of  whom 
bid  for  Russian  help. 

Another  factor  that  helped  to  consolidate  the  Russian 
power  was  the  opening  of  trade  with  the  natives.  In 
1648  the  merchants  of  the  Central  Asian  Khanates 
were  permitted  to  trade  in  Siberia.  The  Bokhariots 
brought  furs  to  the  country  about  Tiumen,  and  half  a 
century  later  a  considerable  exchange  had  sprung  up, 
concentrated  at  the  Yamyshef  lake,  east  of  the  Irtish, 
between  the  Russians,  Kalmuks,  Bokhariots,  and  Tash- 
kendians.  This  intercourse  with  Central  Asiatics  could 
not  but  furnish  the  Russians  with  information  as  to  the 
interior  of  the  continent,  of  which  they  took  advantage 
in  1665  to  send  the  Boyar  Theodore  Baikof,  byway  of 
Sungaria,  to  China.  Starting  from  Tobolsk,  he  reached 
the  camp  of  Taishi  Ablai,  a  Kalmuk  chief,  and  passed 
the  winter  there.  In  spring  he  proceeded  to  the  Beska 
rivulet,  near  which  Ablai  was  then  erecting  two  stone 
palaces,  now  known  as  "  Ablai's  Halls."  This  spot 
he  left  on  24th  July,  and  by  the  7th  August  arrived  at 
the  camp  of  the  Kontaisha,  or  emperor  s  sons,  from 
which  another  10  days*  journey  brought  him  to  Nor 
Zaisan,  whence  he  journeyed  for  17  days  to  the  sources 
of  the  Irtish,  and  then  proceeded  to  China.  This 
journey  would  appear  to  have  been  undertaken  at  a 


RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  THB  IRTISH.  m^ 

favourable  opportunity,  for  30  years  later  we  find 
Ysbrant  Ides  at  Tiumen,  journeying  on  a  political 
mission  to  China,  and  dryly  remarking,  "  If  i:  were  safe 
to  travel  the  Kalmukian  country,  the  most  expeditious 
way  would  be  to  pass  the  Jamuschowa  (Yamyshef) 
lake  "  ;  and  then  he  adds,  "  Strolling  incursions  are 
very  frequently  made  by  the  Kalmuks  upon  their 
czarish  majesties'  frontiers,  but  are  repelled  by  the 
Tobolskians,"     Accordingly,  like  a  discreet  man,  he 


gave  the  Kalmuks  a  wide  berth,  and  journeyed  on  by 
way  of  the  Obi. 

In  the  fifteenth  century  some  of  the  Mongol  tribes 
formed  a  union,  known  as  the  Durben  Oirat,  or  "  four 
allies  "  ;  of  which,  at  the  beginning  of  the  seventeenth 
century,  some  of  the  petty  chiefs  endeavoured  to  make 
themselves  independent,  and  came  to  the  Russians  for 
help. 

Batur-kun-taitsi,  son  of  Khara-kul,  one  of  the  sove- 
reigns of  the  Oirat,  thus  entered  into  relations  with  the 
invaders  in  1649,  and  was  succeeded,  first  by  his  son 


126  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

Galdan,  and  in  1697  by  his  grandson,  Tsevan  Rabdan, 
the  latter  of  whom  was  recognized  by  both  China 
and  Russia.  He  subdued  many  petty  princes  from 
the  Altai  to  the  Balkhash,  and  exacted  tribute  from 
Eastern  Turkistan,  as  well  as  Samarkand,  Bokhara, 
and  even  Balkh.  He  married  the  daughter  of  Ayuka, 
Khan  of  the  Torgouts,  a  branch  of  the  Oirats  living 
along  the  Irtish,  but  fell  out  with  him,  and  compelled 
the  Torgouts  to  move  westwards  to  the  lower  regions 
of  the  Volga,  where  they  were  known  as  Kalmuks. 
and  whence  they  returned,  on  the  invitation  of  the 
Chinese,  in  1771.  Tsevan  Rabdan  also  conquered 
another  branch  of  the  Oirat  in  Tangut,  attacked  Tibet, 
and  even  opposed  the  Lama.*  He  was  likewise  suc- 
cessful in  a  war  with  China,  and  left  his  son,  Galdan 
Tsyran,  to  pursue,  from  1727  to  1745,  a  similar  career 
of  war  and  bloodshed.  The  power  of  Galdan*s  sons 
was  overthrown  by  two  tribal  leaders,  named  Davatsi 
and  Amursana,  whose  quarrel  with  each  other  led  to 
Amursana  being  beaten  and  driven  to  Pekin,  whence 
with  Chinese  help  he  returned,  and  overthrew  his  oppo- 
nent to  become  ruler  of  Sungaria,  in  1755. 

Such  were  the  Kalmuks,  whose  incursions  against 
the  Russians  began  about  the  time  of  the  fall  of  Kuchum 
Khan,  whose  people  they  assisted.  The  Kalmuks 
claimed  that  the  Turkish  tribes  about  Tara  had  been 
their  subjects  from  time  immemorial,  from  whom 
accordingly  they  had  the  right  to  collect  tribute. 
When  they  appeared  to  assert  this  claim  in  1606,  the 
Russians  beat  them,  but  failed  to  drive  them  entirely 
away ;  after  which  the  Kalmuks  laid  claim  to  the  salt 
mines   in  the  neighbourhood  of  Tara.     Finding,  how-

Mongols,"  i.,  pp.  614 — 646. 


RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  THE  IRTISH.  127 

ever,  their  policy  to  be  unwise,  they  feigned  submission 
to  the  Russians,  till  having  been  worsted  in  a  contest 
with  Altan  Khan  of  the  Mongols,  several  of  them  in 
162 1  came  wandering  along  the  banks  of  the  Irtish 
and  Obi,  and  in  1634  ravaged  the  neighbourhood  of 
Tara,  and  besieged  the  town.  They  were  again  re- 
pulsed;  and  in  1638  they  promised  not  to- molest  the 
Russians  further. 

These  transactions  and  struggles  on  the  frontier 
were  no  doubt  carried  on  by  small  detached  tribes, 
largely  on  their  own  account ;  but,  meanwhile,  the 
Russians  had  determined  to  penetrate  into  the  enemy's 
country.  For  the  defence  of  the '  Barabinski  Tatars, 
who  had  become  subjects  of  the  Tsar,  from  the  hostile 
irruptions  of  the  Kalmuks,  as  well  as  the  plunderings 
of  the  Kirghese,  the  Russian  Government  determined 
at  the  beginning  of  the  seventeenth  century  to  occupy 
the  Upper  Irtish,  and  to  build  along  it  a  line  of  forts, 
added  to  which  a  less  justifiable  motive  urged  the 
invaders  towards  Central  Asia;  for,  in  1713,  Prince 
Gagarin,  Governor  of  Siberia,  reported  to  the  Great 
Peter,  who  had  now  ascended  the  throne,  the  possi- 
bility not  only  of  constructing  a  line  of  forts  along  the 
Irtish,  but  of  continuing  it  through  Sungaria  as  far  as 
Yarkand,  where  gold  was  said  to  abound. 

This  excited  both  the  cupidity  and  the  aggressive 
spirit  of  Peter  the  Great,  who,  in  17 14,  directed 
Colonel  Bukholts  to  take  a  detachment  of  1,500 
men  to  Yamyshef  lake,  there  to  build  a  fortress  and 
occupy  it  until  the  spring,  and  thence  to  proceed — 
building  redoubts  for  dep6ts  and  communications  as 
he  went — to  the  Irket,  whence  was  supposed  to  be 
brought  the  gold.  Bukholts  built  a  fortress  at  Lake 
Yamyshef,    in     1715,   from   which,    however,   he   was 


128  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

driven  with  great  loss  by  the  Kalmuks,  so  that  he 
had  to  retire  towards  Tobolsk,  but  halted  on  his 
way  at  the  mouth  of  the  River  Om,  and  there  in 
the  following  spring  built  the  fortress  of  Omsk.  In 
1 718  the  first  fortress  was  built  at  Semipolatinsk,  and 
in  the  following  year  two  officers — Urasof  and  Somof 
— having  received  the  Emperor's  orders  to  proceed 
on  an  expedition  to  Yarkand,  surveyed  the  shores  of 
Lake  Zaisan,  and  the  banks  of  the  U  pper  and  Lower 
Irtish.  In  the  same  year  Prince  Gagarin  was  ordered 
by  an  ukase  to  survey  the  Kalmuk  lands,  to  ascertain 
the  number  of  troops,  and  to  induce  the  local  chiefs 
to  take  the  oath  of  allegiance. 

With  a  view  to  this,  and  to  build  a  fort  on  Lake 
Zaisan,  General  Likhareff  was  despatched  in  1720  up 
the  Irtish,  with  34  flat-bottomed  boats  and  440 
soldiers.  He  reached  Nor  Zaisan,  and  was  ascending 
for  12  days  the  Upper  Irtish,  beyond  the  parts  visited 
by  Urasof  and  Somof,  when  he  met  with  Galdan 
Cheren,  son  of  Tsevan-Rabdan,  who,  with  20,000 
Kalmuks,  was  watching  his  frontier  against  the 
Chinese.  Likhareff,  after  a  skirmish,  managed  to 
hoodwink  the  Kalmuks  as  to  his  intentions,  and  then 
turned  back,  building  on  his  way  Ust-Kamenogorsk, 
in  1720;  after  which  the  Tsar,  disappointed  again  of 
his  gold-dust,  sent  orders  next  year,  according  to 
Zemlianitsyn,*  that  the  Yamyshef  fortress  was  to  be 
strengthened,  that  they  were  "  to  make  peace  with  the 
head  of  the  Kalmuks,  and  take  a  company  of  mer- 
chants to  him,  to  the  Chinese  towns  Selim  and  Daba, 
and  to  the  dwelling  of  the  Dalai- Lama ;  further,  that 
these  merchants  were  not  to  labour  for  gain,  but  that

skilled  persons  were  to  accompany  them  to  purchase, 
or  even  to  examine  the  gold,  where  it  was  found,  and 
in  what  quantity,  also  the  roads  leading  thereto,  and 
finally,  even  though  it  should  be  with  difficulty,  to 
seize  that  place."  Peter  the  Great  died  before  his 
gold  robbery  could  be  carried  out,  but  in  this  way  was 
commenced  the  line  of  forts  on  the  Irtish.  In  1722 
another  small  wooden  fortified  building,  called  Kainsk, 
was  erected  on  the  Barabinski  Steppe ;  and  1 5  years 
later  a  line  of  forts  was  extended,  under  the  name  of 
the  New  Siberian  or  I  shim  line,  westwards  all  across 
the  Steppe  to  the  advanced  posts  of  Orenburg,  which 
line  was  connected  with  the  Irtish  in  1752. 

Semipolatinsk  was  no  sooner  founded  than  there 
flocked  to  it,  as  to  Yamyshef,  Kalmuks,  Bukhariots,  and 
other  Asiatics,  for  the  purposes  of  trade,  which  so 
increased  that  in  1 733  commissioners  were  appointed 
for  the  Semipolatinsk  Customs.  In  the  previous  year 
the  Russian  Government  had  sent  an  ambassador  to 
Galdan  Cheren,  the  ruler  of  Sungaria,  then  living  on 
the  Hi,  with  proposals  respecting  the  abolition  of 
Customs  between  the  two  nations,  whereupon  Galdan 
Cheren  sent  an  embassy  to  the  Russian  capital,  which 
returned  through  Tobolsk  in  1736,  with  presents, 
besides  goods  purchased  in  Moscow,  to  the  value  of 
;^i,300.  Ten  years  later  another  Sungarian  embassy 
went  to  Moscow,  whereupon  the  Imperial  Government 
repeated  its  desire  for  continuance  of  trade,  and  ordered 
the  Siberian  frontier  authorities  to  maintain  friendly 
relations  with  the  Kalmuks,  and  not  to  give  them  any 
offence  ;  but  when  the  ambassadors  returned,  it  was 
explained  to  them  at  Tobolsk  that  Sungarian  subjects 
could  come  only  for  trading  purposes  to  the  forts  of 
Yamyshef  and  Semipolatinsk. 

VOL.  I.  Q 


130  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Thus  it  will  be  seen  that,  at  the  time  of  the  gradual 
occupation  of  the  Irtish  by  the  Russians,  they  had  to 
contend  with  an  enemy  of  some  importance.  At  that 
time  the  Khan  of  Sungaria  ruled  over  Tashkend, 
Turkistan,  and  Sairam,  all  of  which  he  had  taken  from 
the  Khans  of  the  Kirghese  Kazaks,  and  he  had  carried 
on  war  so  successfully  with  the  Chinese  as  to  drive 
them  to  the  Russians  for  succour. 

The  end  of  the  Kalmuks,  however,  was  near.  I 
have  already  mentioned  that  Amursana,  with  the  help 
of  the  Chinese,  became  ruler  of  Sungaria  in  1755,  in 
which  position  he  expected  to  reign  independently, 
whereas  he  found  that  he  was  merely  to  hold  an 
honorary  rank  under  the  Chinese,  who  proceeded  to 
divide  the  Oirat  territory  into  four  provinces,  to  be 
placed  under  Chinese  administration.  Upon  this 
Amursana  incited  his  subjects  to  rebel,  and  the  Chinese, 
bent  on  getting  rid  of  the  troublesome  Kalmuks,  de- 
termined to  slaughter  them  wholesale.  The  massacre 
was  so  indiscriminately  pursued  that,  of  a  population 
in  1756  of  600,000  souls,  scarce  one  Sungarian  re- 
mained, those  few  not  killed  having  fled  to  the 
Russians  or  the  Kirghese. 

Thus  perished  the  Sungarian  kingdom,  of  which 
now  almost  the  only  memorials  in  the  country  are 
tumuli  or  circular  mounds,  from  10  to  100  feet  in 
diameter,  that  are  found  in  numbers  between  Sergiopol 
and  Kopal.  They  are  surrounded  by  rows  of  stones, 
and  in  some  cases  have  on  them  rudely-carved  figures 
of  recumbent  warriors.  The  figures  represent  men 
with  thick  mustaches,  but  without  beards,  holding  in 
the  right  hand  a  cup,  and  grasping  with  their  left  a 
double-handled  sword  stuck  into  the  belt,  whilst  at 
the  back  of  the  head  are  a  number  of  small  plaits  of

hair,  quite  unlike  the  long  tresses  worn  by  the  Mongols 
of  the  present  day. 

We  come   now   to   the   third  of  the  peoples  with 
whom    the   Russians  were  brought  in  contact  in  an- 
nexing the  Irtish.     At  the  time  just  mentioned,  when 
the  Chinese  were  committing  everything  in  Sungaria 
to  fire  and  the  sword,  the  Russians  deemed  it  prudent 
to  place  their  frontier  in  a  defensive  condition  ;  espe- 
cially  as  it  was  observed  that,  if  the  Chinese  junks 
sailed  out  of  Lake  Zaisan  with  hostile  intentions,  their 
progress  could  not  be  checked  by  the  forts  along  the 
Irtish,   nor  was  there  adequate  protection  either   for 
the  Altai  mines,  or  for  the  Teleuts  who   nomadized 
in  the  vicinity  of  the  Teletsk  lake.      It  was  decided, 
therefore,  to  extend  the   line   along   the  Irtish  from 
Ust-Kamenogorsk  to  the  River  Bukhtarma,  to  which 
it  was  thought  the  Chinese  could  not  object,   if  the 
Russians  did  not  establish  themselves  on  the  Zaisan. 
The  Bukhtarminsk    fort   accordingly  was   erected    in 
1 760,  and  in  1 764  an  expedition  was  despatched  for  the 
survey  of  the  Zaisan,  the  officers  returning  with  the 
conviction  that  a  Chinese  flotilla  was  not  dangerous  to 
Russia  from  that  quarter.     Nor  did  the  Chinese  offer 
hostilities,  though  they  appear  to  have  kept  an  eye  on 
the  Russian  proceedings.     Many  years  afterwards,  in 
1822,    the   Cossack   fisheries   were    extended    to   the 
Zaisan,  and  subsequently  established  to  the  exclusion 
of  all  others. 

It  was  thought  by  the  Siberian  authorities  that  the 
forts  of  Bukhtarminsk  and  Ust-Kamenogorsk  would 
answer  as  good  central  points  for  trade  with  China, 
India,  and  Tatary,  and  certain  immunities  were 
granted  to  merchants  on  goods  passing  through  Bukh- 
tarminsk,  but  the   result  was  not  satisfactory.       Nor 


132  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

was  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  opened  as  a  trading  place  in 
1765,  destined  to  be  a  flourishing  place  of  commerce, 
although  the  Chinese  in  1804  professed  a  wish  to  come 
there  with  goods  for  barter  with  the  Russians.  It  may 
very  well  be,  however,  that  the  crafty  Celestials  merely 
hid  under  this  declaration  their  desire  to  watch  the 
Russians,  who  were  consolidating  their  authority  on 
the  Kirghese  Steppe  ;  for  here,  as  also  at  Bukhtarminsk, 
where  trade  was  ordered  to  be  carried  on  in  1797,  and 
a  custom-house  established  six  years  later,  these  would- 
be  merchants  were  constantly  coming  to  every  house 
offering  brick  tea  and  copper  pipes,  not  apparently 
with  the  desire  to  find  customers  so  much  as  to  observe 
whether  there  was  any  collection  of  Russian  troops  or 
military  preparations. 

At  Semipolatinsk,  however,  a  considerable  trade 
sprung  up,  Chinese  soldiers  coming  there  as  early  as 
1757  to  sell  silver  and  Sungarian  captives  ;  but  the  war 
of  the  Chinese  with  Sungaria  caused  a  great  falling  off 
of  commerce,  an  end  being  thereby  put  to  the  caravan 
trade  across  the  frontier,  so  that  the  custom-house  staff 
had  to  be  reduced.  In  1776  the  commercial  exchange 
of  Semipolatinsk  was  moved  to  a  new  site,  which  was 
regarded  as  advantageous  from  both  a  strategic  and 
commercial  point  of  view,  since  it  attracted  the  Asiatics 
to  bring  their  goods,  and  also  to  purchase  Russian 
wares  for  sale  in  Western  China,  thereby  competing 
with  the  trading  establishments  the  Chinese  had  built 
near  the  present  Urjarsk  station  and  at  Chuguchak, 
Entrance  to  these  places  was  prohibited  to  the  Rus- 
sians, who  could  trade  there  only  under  the  disguise 
of  Asiatics.  This  barrier  had  to  be  removed,  and 
in  181 1,  when  Chinese  merchants  began  trading  at 
Bukhtarminsk,    General    Glasenap   despatched    from 


RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  THE  IRTISH.  133 

thence  his  interpreter,  Putimsof,  to  Kuldja,  with  the 
result  that  Russian  caravans  were  allowed  to  proceed 
both  there  and  to  Chuguchak.  This  seems  so  to 
have  diverted  the  stream  of  commerce  that  in  1839 
the  custom-house  at  Bukhtarminsk  was  transferred  to 
Omsk. 

Meanwhile  the  Russian  export  trade  with  China 
increased,  but  with  one  serious  drawback.  All  com- 
merce at  first  was  carried  on  by  barter,  but  the 
subsequent  appearance  on  the  bazaars  of  gold,  first  in 
coin  and  then  in  dust  and  bars,  had  an  injurious  effect 
on  the  exchange  of  Russian  goods.  Such  was  the 
commercial  condition  when  the  Minister  for  Foreign 
Affairs  at  Petersburg  proposed  to  establish  Russian 
factories  within  the  Chinese  territory.  In  August, 
1851,  a  treaty  between  the  two  Governments  was 
concluded,  and  the  presence  of  Russian  consuls  at  the 
factories  put  a  stop  to  the  open  trade  in  gold,  but  its 
contraband  sale  could  not  be  prevented  ;  and  from 
this  cause  the  Russian  trade  was  still  suffering  in 
1856,  at  which  date  the  exports  amounted  in  value 
to  jCjS^ooOy  and  the  imports  to  ;^67,ooo,  when  the 
commerce  ceased  altogether,  owing  to  the  destruction 
by  fire  of  the  factory  and  all  the  goods  it  contained. 
The  consulates  were  re-established  two  years  afterwards, 
but  in  1 86 1,  according  to  M.  Abramof,  the  trade  still 
languished.  In  1871  the  Hi  province  passed  tempo- 
rarily into  the  hands  of  the  Russians,  but  as  it  was  to 
revert  to  the  Chinese  in  1883  the  newly-appointed 
Russian  consul,  whom  I  met  in  passing  through 
Omsk,  was  on  the  eve  of  taking  his  departure  to 
Chuguchak,  and  I  subsequently  stayed  in  the  house 
of  the  Russian  consul  at  Kuldja.  Thus  I  have 
brought  down  to  the  present  day  the  transactions  of 


134  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

the    Russians   with   the    third   of  the    peoples    they 
encountered  on  the  Irtish. 

Let  me  not  omit  to  mention,  however,  that  whilst 
the    Russian  Cossacks  and  merchants    were   pushing 
further   southwards,    the    Government    was    planting 
institutions  and  strengthening  its  administration  in  the 
rear.    In  1 744  a  road  was  constructed  from  Tobolsk,  the 
capital,  to  Tara,  and  10  years  later  posting  was  esta- 
blished from   Moscow  to  Tobolsk.      Tara   does   not 
seem  ever  to  have  become  a  place  of  great  prominence, 
but  Omsk  and  Semipolatinsk  forts  both  grew  in  im- 
portance, the  latter  being  made  a  "  town  "  without  a 
district    in    1764,  and    in    1782    an   uyezd  town.       In 
1804  Omsk  and   Kainsk  were  exalted    to   the   same 
municipal  rank,  and  at  the  former,  five  years  later,  was 
formed  an  infantry  regiment.      This  necessitated,  in 
1 8 13,  the  establishment  in  Omsk  of  a  Cossack  school, 
that  was  subsequently  united  to  and  afterwards  incor- 
porated with  an  Asiatic  school  that  had  been  set  on 
foot  there  more  than  30  years  before.    Further  changes 
were  made,  however,   in   1846,  when  the  school  was 
adopted  for  the  Siberian  cadet  corps,  and  from  it,  in 
the  following  year,  the  teaching  of  Asiatic  languages 
was  transferred  to  the  town  school  for  soldiers*  children. 
The  whole  of  Siberia  having  been  placed   under  two 
Governors-General  in  1822,  the  district  about  Omsk 
was  formed  into  an  ablast,  or  province,  of  that  name, 
and  a  Cossack  cloth  factory  established  in  the  capital 
for   the    employment    of    exiles.      The    new   oblast, 
however,  did    not  at   first   flourish   very  well,   for  in 
1823   the  capital  was  destroyed    by  fire,   and    in    the 
following  year,  through  lack  of  funds  from   its  own 
resources,  the  neighbouring  provinces  of  Tobolsk  and 
Tomsk    had    to    expend   in   the   oblast    upwards    of 


RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  THE  IRTISH.  135 

;^  1 2,000.  This  poverty  seems  to  have  lingered  awhile, 
for  in  1826  the  Cossacks  were  allowed  to  engage  in 
trade.  In  the  following  year  an  institution  for  granting 
public  assistance  was  opened  in  Omsk,  to  which  town, 
also,  in  1838,  were  removed  from  Tobolsk  the  resi- 
dence of  the  Governor- General,  and  the  whole  staff 
of  the  chief  administration  of  Western  Siberia.  The 
oblast  was  then  suppressed,  and  instead  of  it  there  was 
constituted  a  **  frontier  administration  "  ;  Omsk,  Petro- 
pavlovsk,  and  the  Cossack  villages  of  the  I  shim  line 
being  added  to  the  Tobolsk  province  ;  and  Semipola- 
tinsk  and  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  with  the  Cossack  villages 
on  the  Irtish,  being  added  to  the  Tomsk  province. 

There  was  yet  another  people,  the  Kirghese,  with 
whom  the  Russians  were  brought  in  contact  during 
their  occupation  of  the  Irtish,  but  of  these  I  can  better 
treat  in  connection  with  the  Russian  occupation  of 
Semirechia.

THE  town  of  Semipolatinsk  (pronounced  Semi- 
palatinsk),  at  which  I  arrived  on  the  24th  August, 
derives  its  name  from  **  Sempalati  " — seven  palaces  or 
buildings,  the  ruins  of  which  were  seen  in  1734  by 
Gmelin,  who  called  the  place  "Sempalatnaya-Krepost," 
or  fortress.  These  buildings  had  served  as  temples 
for  the  Kalmuks,  and  one  of  them  still  contained  two 
idols  of  bears,  and  on  the  walls  of  another  were  partially 
discerned  representations  of  men,  whilst  not  far  distant 
in  the  valley  of  Ablaikit  were  found  the  ruins  of  another 
temple  of  Buddhist  origin.  The  present  Russian  town 
stands  on  the  lofty  right  bank  of  the  Irtish,  11  miles 
from  the  original  site,  now  called  **  Old  Semipolatinsk," 
my  last  post-station,  and  whence  one  or  more  migrations 
had  been  found  necessary  by  reason  of  the  eating  away 
of  the  river's  bank,  and  the  encroachments  of  the  sand- 
dunes.     It  has  a  public  garden  with  14  fountains.     On 


FROM  SEMIPOLATINSK  TO  SERGIOPOL.  137 

the  left  bank  stands  the  rare  spectacle  of  a  Kirghese 
town,  where  these  settled  children  of  the  desert  dwell  in 
houses  of  wood,  with  curtained  windows.  Surrounded 
by  a  desert  of  sand,  Semipolatinsk  has  all  the  disad- 
vantages of  a  continental  climate,  with  few  corresponding 
advantages.  The  Russians  established  here  a  meteoro- 
logical station,  where,  as  in  other  stations  in  Central 
Asia,  observations  were  recorded  thrice  daily — at  seven, 
one,  and  nine.* 

It  was  not  my  intention  to  stay  longer  in  Semipola- 
tinsk than  was  necessary,  and  I  accordingly  sallied 
forth  betimes  in  the  morning  on  the  typical  Russian 
droshky  to  pay  my  respects  to  the  Governor,  General 
Protzenko.  His  Excellency  had  already  heard  of  me, 
and  was  prepared  to  help  me  in  every  way  possible, 
regretting  only  that  his  household  was  all  but  broken 
up,  because  he  was  on  the  point  of  departure  to  a  distant 
portion  of  his  province.  He  gave  me  permission  to 
visit  the  prison,  where  we  found  an  Afghan  prisoner ; 

♦  From  observations  taken  from  October,  1854,  *o  January,  i860,  the 
average  yearly  temperature  was  found  to  be  +  24''77,  the  average 
of  winter  being  -7'''56;  spring,  +34"'-ii;  summer,  +24'**84;  and 
autumn,  +37°'o8.  From  the  published  statistics  for  1877,  it  appears 
that  the  greatest  heat  in  Semipolatinsk  was  +99 ''•32,  and  the  greatest 
cold  -57** "82,  the  mean  temperature  for  the  year  being  +35'''24,  or  I4**7 
less  than  at  Greenwich.  The  rainfall  for  the  Arctic  Ocean  river  systems 
generally  is  computed  to  average  7*87  inches  annually,  but  the  rainfall 
on  the  Irtish  at  Semipolatinsk  was  only  5*58  inches  as  compared  with  27*28 
inches  in  1877  at  Greenwich.  The  number  of  days  for  the  whole  year 
1877  with  rain  was  89 ;  with  snow,  48 ;  hail,  i ;  thunderstorms,  13  ; 
whilst  some  indication  of  the  aspect  of  the  sky  may  be  gathered  from 
the  registration  of  76  days  clear,  91  overcast,  and  16  stormy.  The 
prevailing  quarter  whence  the  wind  came  was  east,  for  which  there 
were  recorded  141  observations,  and  116  from  the  south.  Least  wind 
came  from  the  north-east  and  north-west,  each  furnishing  32  registrations, 
whilst  467  observations  were  recorded  as  calm,  or  without  wind.  The 
barometer  rose  in  December,  1877,  ^^  ^^^  ^^  30*89  inches,  and  fell  to 
the  minimum  of  the  year  in  July  to  28*69,  the  mean  for  the  year  being

138  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

then  we  made  our  way  to  a  small  ''prioof'  or  asylum. 
It  contained  only  ii  children  and  3  old  men  and 
women,  who  were  maintained  by  a  ladies*  society  for  the 
care  of  the  poor.  During  the  preceding  year  3  girls 
and  4  old  people  had  left  the  institution,  to  be  received 
by  their  relations  or  by  tradespeople  as  apprentices. 
It  was  interesting  to  find  this  little  almshouse  so  far 
away  in  the  heart  of  Asia,  and  it  spoke  well  for  the 
prosperity  of  the  capital,  that,  although  the  funds  for 
maintaining  it  were  so  ample,  yet  there  were  so  few 
needing  such  a  refuge.* 

The  children  of  the  asylum  were  taught  in  the  various 
schools  of  the  town,  of  which  there  are  4  for  the 
Russians  (one  each  for  upper-  and  lower-class  boys 
and  girls,  and  one  parish  and  one  smaller  school), 
one  for  15  Jewish  boys,  and  8  Tatar  schools  for  549 
male  scholars,  presenting  for  the  capital  a  total  of  13 
schools,  attended  by  904  scholars,  of  whom  only  1 1 6 
were  girls,  t 

After  our  visit  to  the  asylum  we  called  on  Mr. 
Michaelis,  who  was  learned  in  statistics  respecting  the 
province,  and  then  upon  a  gentleman  given  to  scientific 
pursuits,  after  which  we  made  our  way  to  the  post  and 
telegraphic  office,  to  find  awaiting  me  the  valuable 
telegram  (already  alluded  to)  from  General  Kolpakovsky. 

*  The  receipts  for  1881  were  j^25i,  of  which  jf  152  was  a  balance  from 
1880;  ;^20  was  given  by  the  Town  Council ;  ;^28  subscribed  by  members, 
and  £^0  was  from  other  sources.  Besides  money  donations,  the  society 
received  materials  for  clothing,  etc.  The  maintenance  of  the  asylum  cost 
only  ;^57,  and  £22^  were  distributed  to  the  people,  leaving  a  balance  to 
carry  forward  to  1882  of  £it^» 

t  Taking  the  places  of  education  throughout  the  province,  it  appeared 
that  in  1881  there  were  83  schools  (including  one  technical  school,  and 
others  for  Kirghese,  Tatars,  and  Jews),  in  which  were  taught  2,127  ^^X^ 
and  293  girls,  being  99  of  either  sex  less  than  in  the  preceding  year;  this 
decrease,  however,  being  traceable  to  the  lack  of  data  concerning 
Tatar  girls.     The  number  of  Russian  pupils  increased. 


FROM  SEMIPOLATINSK  TO  SERGIOPOL.  139 

The  last  opportunity  we  should  have  for  awhile  for 
purchasing  post  cards  and  stamps  was  in  this  head 
office  of  the  province.  Some  idea  of  the  postal  affairs 
may  be  formed  from  the  fact  that  in  its  13  post-offices 
and  stations  for  the  reception  of  correspondence;^  1,504 
were  expended  for  maintenance  and  administrative 
expenses,  and  ;^3,77i  received.* 

The  buildings  of  Semipolatinsk  did  not  strike  me  as 
remarkable.  There  were,  however,  many  large  ware- 
houses, a  reminder  of  the  fact  that  the  town  was  long 
celebrated  for  its  commercial  relations  with  Central 
Asia.  The  Russian  and  Tatar  merchants  of  Semi- 
polatinsk sell  in  the  bazaars  tea,  sugar,  and  other 
groceries,  cotton  stuffs,  Chinese  silks,  porcelain,  furs, 
wax,  and  honey.  The  principal  trade  is  carried  on  in 
winter,  when  the  Cossacks  and  peasants  come  in  from 
the  neighbouring  districts,  bringing  skins,  ropes,  and 
other  produce.  The  Kirghese  also — some  on  horse- 
back, and  others  in  camel-carts — bring  cattle  and 
camels* -hair,  which  they  dispose  of  to  purchase  grain, 
flour,  tobacco,  iron  ware,  and  wooden  boxes. 

After  this  flourish  of  trumpets  respecting  the  trade 
of  the  capital,  it  will  sound  somewhat  strange  that  our 
departure  was  delayed  by  reason  of  our  being  unable 
to  purchase  throughout  the  town  a  sufficiency  of  white 
bread.  Foreseeing  that  we  should  have  to  travel 
many  miles  before  we  could  reckon  on  the  possibility 
of  replenishing  our  stores,  we  purchased  sundry  pro- 
visions, leaving  the  article  of  bread  to  the  last,  so  that 

*  The  total  number  of  letters,  etc.,  posted  in  all  the  postal  establish- 
ments of  the  province  during  the  year  1881  amounted  to  254,278,  viz. : —

it  might  be  new ;  but  we  could  find  only  one  baker  of 
white  bread,  a  German,  who  inveighed  against  the 
badness  of  the  local  flour,  and  said  that  he  should 
leave  the  place.  He  could  promise  no  supplies  till 
next  morning,  and  thus  we  were  prevented  starting 
on  Thursday  night.  The  incident  tended,  however,  to 
evoke  a  well-known  trait  of  Russian  character.  The 
Governor-General's  telegram  commended  me  not  only 


to  the  good  offices  in  general,  but  also  to  the  "  hospi- 
tality" of  the  authorities,  and  this  proved  to  be  no 
empty  form,  for  when  in  the  evening,  after  a  call  from 
Mr.  Michaelis,  General  Protzenko  did  me  the  honour 
of  a  visit,  and  I  mentioned  that  we  were  delayed  for 
lack  of  bread,  his  Excellency  expressed  his  regret  that 
his  own  cuisine  was  already  packed  and  started,  and 
asked  Colonel  llyinsky,  chief  of  the  staff,  to  come  to 
the  rescue.    We  had  already  tried  to  purchase  from 


FROM  SEMIFOLATINSK  TO  SERGIOPOL,  141 

one  or  two  private  persons,  but  they  had  only  sufficient 
bread  for  the  day.  Early  next  morning,  however, 
good  things  were  showered  upon  us  in  abundance. 
Not  only  did  the  baker  bring  his  tale  of  loaves,  but 
Mr.  Michaelis  added  to  their  number,  and  Colonel 
Ilyinski  himself  brought  us  bread,  butter,  cakes,  and 
jam,  and  wished  us  bon  voyage  ! 

At  half-past  nine,  therefore,  with  a  full  commissariat, 
we  started  for  Sergiopol,  a  distance  of  1 80  miles,  com- 
prising 1 1  stations  and  i  o  changes  of  horses,  being 
accompanied  by  a  subordinate  sent  by  the  police- 
master  to  see  us  safely  over  the  Irtish.* 

I  had  heard  dismal  complaints  of  the  road  south  of 
Semipolatinsk,  owing  to  the  paucity  of  horses.  Even 
in  the  official  report  for  1881  it  appeared  that  136 
complaints  had  been  lodged  at  the  stations  by  passen- 
gers, and  it  was  said  that  General  Kolpakovsky  himself 
had  found  the  posting  accommodation  in  the  southern 
Steppe  not  to  his  liking.  This,  no  doubt,  was  partly 
owing  to  the  increased  traffic  consequent  upon  the 
breaking  down  of  the  postal  service  from  Orenburg  to 
Tashkend,  which  caused  the  post  to  be  brought  all 
round  by  the  Irtish,  and  necessitated  an  increase  in  the 
number  of  horses,  t

t  In  the  province  of  Semipolatinsk  the  1,327  miles  of  post-roads  (of 
which  601  miles  were  highways  to  the  Akmolinsk,  Semirechia,  and 
Tomsk  provinces,  the  remainder  being  communications  with  the  interior) 
were  served  from  85  stations  and  pickets,  at  which  were  maintained 
174  pairs  of  post  and  10  pairs  of  farm  horses,  a  *'  pair  '*  being  used,  I 
suppose,  in  the  Russian  postal  sense  of  a  troika  or  three  animals.     For 


142  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

It  was  to  me,  however,  a  source  of  great  comfort, 
that  I  was  now  kindly  supplied  with  a  Crown  podorojna, 
so  that  I  might  fairly  reckon  upon  doing  as  well  as 
could  be  expected  under  the  circumstances.  During 
the  first  24  hours  we  covered  127  miles.  The  road  to 
Sergiopol  lay  almost  due  south  from  Semipolatinsk, 
and  for  the  first  two  stations  presented  a  bare  land- 
scape, relieved  only  here  and  there  by  a  few  auls  or 
collections  of  tents,  and  cattle  of  the  Kirghese.  Arka- 
lyksk  stood  in  the  middle  of  a  desert,  at  an  altitude 
of  950  feet,  whence  we  passed  on  over  vast  plains 
without  a  sign  of  life,  and  across  a  low  range  of  hills, 
rising  to  1,280  feet. 

We  descended  to  i  ,000  feet  at  Ashchikulsk,  and  rose 
to  1,300  at  Djertatsk,  which  we  reached  in  the  evening, 
and  then  posted  on  through  the  night  past  Kazyl- 
Mulinsk,  1,450  feet  high,  and  then  gradually  mounted 
to  1,700  feet  at  Arkadskiy  (or  Arcat).  In  the  very 
early  dawn  we  passed  the  seventh  station,  and  break- 
fasted at  the  eighth,  after  which  the  road  was  so 
intolerably  dusty  that  we  sometimes  could  not  see  the 
horses'  heads.  In  the  afternoon  we  approached  Altyn- 
Kalat,  the  frontier  station  between  the  provinces  of 
Semipolatinsk  and  Semirechia.  Count  Waldburg- 
Zeil  computed  its  height  to  be  2, 133  feet,  so  that  since 
leaving  Semipolatinsk,  750  feet,  we  had  ascended 
1,400  feet,  and  had  reached  the  watershed  of  the 
Chingiz-Tau,  the  western  spur  of  the  Tarbagatai, 
which  together  send  the  rivers  flowing  north  into  the 
Zaisan  and  Irtish,  and  those  flowing  south  into  Lakes 

these  the  Treasury  paid  during  the  year  ;^i 2,584.  Further,  in  conse- 
quence of  the  increased  postal  service  with  Turkistan,  34  stations  were 
augmented  by  8  pairs  for  the  first  3  months,  and  for  the  remainder  of 
the  year  by  4  pairs  ;  that  is,  from  272  to  136  pairs,  for  which  were  paid 


FROM  SEMIPOLATINSK  TO  SERGIOPOL,  143 

Balkhash  and  Ala-Kul.  One  of  these  latter,  however, 
the  Ayaguz,  has  small  pretensions  in  summer  to  a 
river,  for  Sevier  going  to  bathe  therein  found  the 
water  only  ankle-deep. 

On  reaching  Sergiopol,  on  the  banks  of  the  Ayaguz 
and  surrounded  by  sands,  we  found  that  the  good 
offices  of  the  Governor- General  had  preceded  us  in  the 
form  of  a  telegram  that  horses  should  be  in  readiness. 
It  was  Saturday  night,  however,  and  I  had  determined 
to  spend  the  Sunday  there,  expecting  a  larger  town 
than  it  afterwards  proved  to  be,  and  intending  to  visit 
the  hospital  and  prison.  Having,  therefore,  called 
upon  the  chief  military  authority  overnight,  we  slept  at 
the  post-house,  and  went  after  breakfast  to  see  the 
military  hospital,  prison,  and  barracks.  In  this  last 
establishment  I  was  pleased  to  find  a  modest  library  of 
what  seemed  to  me  rather  antiquated  Russian  books, 
probably  the  remains  of  former  days,  when  Sergiopol 
had  greater  military  significance  than  now. 

I  was  glad  to  add  thereto  some  copies  of  the 
Scriptures  and  other  publications,  some  of  which  I  also 
distributed  in  the  hospital  and  prison.  News  of  this 
spread,  and  I  was  speedily  visited  first  by  the  Russian 
priest,  who  came  to  buy  a  Kirghese  New  Testament  to 
present  to  the  mullah,  and  then  by  a  Cossack  school- 
mistress, in  pretty  Russian  costume,  and  wearing  the 
national  head-dress  known  as  the  kokoshnik,  with  which 
I  fell  in  love ;  so,  when  the  young  lady's  purchases 
were  completed,  I  ventured  to  ask  her  to  sell  it  to  me 
for  a  curiosity.  She  gracefully  declined  my  request, 
but  offered  it  as  a  gift.  Accordingly,  I  made  up  its 
value  in  printed  matter,  which  here  I  found  highly 
prized,  as  everywhere  else  along  my  route. 

At  Semipolatinsk  I  could  not  learn  that  the  Governor 


144  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

had  received  any  of  the  books   I  sent  in  1879  to  the 
Governor- General    Kaznakoff    for    the    prisons    and 
hospitals  of  the  Semipolatinsk  government.     General 
Protzenko,    however,    was   willing  to   accept   a    New 
Testament  for  each  room  of  every  prison  and  hospital 
throughout  his  province,  estimating  the  net  number  at 
about  210  rooms  in  all,  after  making  allowance  for  the 
number  of  Kirghese  prisoners  and  patients  who  could 
not  read  Russ.     With  the  Moslems  the  Governor  did 
not  like  to  attempt  much,  but  consented  to  accept  10 
copies  of  the  Kirghese  New  Testament,  to  be  used 
as  opportunity  might  serve.     Accordingly  I  sent  with 
these     100    New    Testaments,    65    Gospels,    and    50 
Psalms  in  Russ,  some  German,   Hebrew,  and  Polish 
Scriptures,  and  about  400   tracts,  etc.     This  done,  I 
repacked  some  of  my  boxes,  so  as  to  have  as  few  as 
possible  on  my  second  conveyance.     At  the  stations 
as  we  came  along  I  continued  my  plan  of  nailing  up 
in  the  post-houses  the  engraving  of  the  **  Prodigal  Son," 
and  offering  my  books  for  sale.      Blessings  indeed  they 
must  have  been,  I  should  think,  in  these  solitary  houses 
in  the  wilderness,  and  the  post-masters  seemed  so  to 
regard  them.     At  the  last  station  before  Semipolatinsk 
an  old  man  said,  **  The   Lord  must  have  sent  these 
books  for  us,*'  and  his  delight  was  great  at  getting  them. 
Between  Semipolatinsk   and   Sergiopol   almost  every 
post-master  purchased  books,  and  some  bought  at  a 
stroke  all  the  selection  I  offered,  as  at   Uluguzk  and 
Uzun-Bulak.     Even  this  did  not  satisfy  my  customer 
at  Altyn-Kalat,  for  he  wanted  another  rouble's  worth. 
The   Russians  took  up  their  position  at  Sergiopol, 
previously    called    Ayaguz,    and   subsequently    named 
after  Sergius.  a  younger  son  of  the  Emperor,  in  1831* 
since  which  date,  their  frontier  having  advanced  south-

wards,  the  place  has  greatly  declined  in  importance. 
The  inhabitants  number  i,chx).  The  town  is  situated 
within  sight  of,  but  at  some  distance  from,  the  post- 
station,  near  which  is  the  fortress  containing  the  church, 
the  house  of  the  nachalniky  or  chief,  and  the  barracks. 
About  16  miles  from  the  town,  in  the  Saikemir  defile, 
beside  the  River  Badpak,  Mr.  Ujfalvy  states  there  have 
been  found  cut  in  the  rock  rude  representations,  resem- 
bling those  found  by  Pallas  and  Spasky  in  Siberia,  of 
wolves,  stags,  camels,  dogs,  snakes,  etc.* 

There  should  also  be  mentioned,  as  existing  within 
120  miles  of  Sergiopol,  several  mineral  deposits,  such 
as  silver  and  lead,  to  the  south-east  near  Chuguchak ; 
graphite  within  20  miles  of  the  town  ;  oil  in  four  places 
to  the  south,  and  copper  on  the  southern  slopes  of  the 
Tarbagatai,  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Abket,  where  lie 
three  beds  belonging  to  Mr.  Permikine,  who  formerly 
worked  them.f 

During  my  short  stay  at  Sergiopol  I  heard  of  a  fellow- 
countryman,   Mr.   Delmar   Morgan,  who  has  laid  the 

*  The  same  author,  one  of  whose  principal  functions  was  the  measuring- 
of  human  heads  and  skulls,  to  the  unconcern  of  course  of  the  dead, 
but  to  the  utter  amazement,  and  sometimes  terror,  of  the  living,  natives, 
states  that  the  crania  found  in  this  region — that  is,  to  the  south-east  of 
the  province  of  Semipolatinsk — present  anthropological  features  exceed- 
ingly remarkable,  the  protuberances  above  the  eyebrows  being  very 
marked,  the  separation  between  the  nose  and  the  glabella  (or  space 
between  the  eyebrows)  being  unusually  deep,  and  the  internal  commis- 
sures, or  angles  of  the  eyes,  being  very  close  together.  It  is  impossible, 
he  says,  that  these  can  be  Mongolian  skulls,  and  adds  that  some  others 
found  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Lake  Issik-Kul  present  analogous 
features. 

t  According  to  Mr.  Tatarinoff  the  lodes  are  nearly  two  feet  thick,  and 
are  formed  almost  exclusively  of  the  following  kinds  of  copper  ore  : 
oxidulated  earthy  copper,  cuprite,  azurite,  and  even  native  copper.  The 
lodes  traverse  argillaceous  schists.  From  the  mines  of  Gratchevo  and 
Gregory  was  obtained  '*  mineral "  producing  from  20  to  30  per  cent,  of 
copper.

English  public  under  obligations  by  his  many  transla- 
tions from  the  Russian.  He  had  preceded  me  in  1880 
to  Sergiopol,  where,  arriving  early  in  April,  he  was 
detained  for  three  weeks  by  the  impassable  state  of  the 
roads.  Not  till  the  6th  of  that  month  did  the  water- 
fowl begin  to  arrive  in  the  lagoons  on  the  left  bank  of 
the  Ayaguz,  and  opposite  the  town  the  ice  of  the  river 
did  not  move  till  the  14th.  He  was  then  preparing  to 
start  for  the  Russian  frontier  town  of  Bakhta,  opposite 
Chuguchak,  when  he  was  hindered  by  a  telegram 
summoning  him  to  Vierny.  The  distance  to  Bakhta 
is  1 74  miles,  with  six  picket  stations  to  Urdjarsk,  a  small 
village,  and  afterwards  four  other  stations,  with  a  post- 
road  all  the  way,  and  not  turning  into  a  caravan  track 
at  Urdjarsk,  as  represented  in  General  Walker  s  map. 
This  last-mentioned  station,  on  the  Urdjar  river,  is 
probably  the  best  starting-point  for  Lake  Ala-Kul,  the 
third  largest  lake  in  Central  Asia. 

The  Ala-Kul,  or  variegated  lake,  is  thought  to  have 
been  joined  at  one  time  to  the  Balkhash,  but  is  now 
an  entirely  distinct  basin  without  effluent,  and  receives 
the  drainage  of  the  circumjacent  Barlik,  Ala-Tau,  and 
Tarbagatai  mountains.* 

Dr.  Finsch  has  given  the  best  account  I  have  met 

*  It  consists  properly  of  three  lakes.  The  large  eastern  part  contains 
bitter  saltwater;  the  western,  called  Sassyk-Kul,  fresh  water;  whilst 
the  central  part  of  the  basin  is  called  Uyali.  On  the  Chinese  maps  the 
whole  lake  bears  the  name  Alak-tugul-nor(Lake  of  the  Variegated  Ox). 
The  normal  altitude  of  Ala-Kul  is  1,200  feet,  but  according  to  Kirghese 
traditions  the  water  of  the  lake  rises  at  times,  and  then  subsides.  Not 
many  years  ago  it  was  possible  for  caravans  to  pass  along  the  isthmus 
of  Uzunai  and  Nar}'n-Uziak,  but  now  both  these  strips  of  land  dividing 
the  lakes  are  covered  in  the  middle  with  water.  The  lake  is  supplied 
by  at  least  four  considerable  rivers,  their  mouths  being  transformed 
into  a  series  of  small  reed-grown  lakes.  In  spring  the  water  submerges 
the  reeds ;  these  rot  in  summer  and  emit  a  putrid  smell,  whence  the 
name  "  Sassyk,"  or  stinking,  given  to  the  western  lake.

with  of  the  fauna  on  the  shores  of  this  lake,  and  of  the 
district  through  which  he  passed.  Along  the  post- 
road  in  autumn  I  saw  but  few  birds  or  living  creatures 
of  any  kind,  but  his  more  practised  eye  discerned  the 
Red-footed  and  two  other  Falcons,  Great  Buzzards,  and 
Harriers.  Wheat-ears  {Saxicola  Oenanthe)  were  to  be 
seen  everywhere  on  the  stone-covered  hill-tops,  whilst 
in  the  thickets  of  Spircea  the  Bluethroats  {Cyanecula 
Suecica)  were  building  their  nests.  The  cry  of  the 
Quail  was  heard  on  every  side,  as  well  as  the  note  of 
the  Cuckoo,  whilst  high  in  the  air  fluttered  the  Chimney 
Swallows  {Hirundo  Rustica),  the  Skylark  (Alauda 
Arvensis),  Pallas's  Short-toed  Lark  {A,  Pispolettd), 
the  Eastern  Shore  Lark  {Otocorys  Brandtt),  and, 
most  common,  though  most  remarkable  x)f  all,  the 
Black  Lark  [A.  Yeltoniensis),  whose  uniform  velvet 
black  plumage,  pale  yellow  beak,  and  large  size  make 
it  both  remarkable  and  interesting.  It  loves  to  sit  on 
stones  by  the  roadside,  or  perch  on  the  bushes,  with 
drooping  wings  and  tail  erect,  singing  there,  as  well 
as  in  the  air,  its  melodious  song.  When  in  flight  it 
appears  even  more  remarkable  than  when  sitting,  for 
in  this  respect  it  differs  from  other  larks.  Clapping 
together  the  points  of  its  wings,  and  whipping  about, 
now  regularly  and  then  in  an  irregular  manner,  its 
flight  may  be  likened  to  that  of  a  bat.  To  these  may 
be  added  in  the  Tarbagatai,  the  Demoiselle  Crane 
{Grus  Virgo),  the  Masked  Wagtail  {Motacilla  Per- 
sonata),  and  the  Black  Stork  {Ciconia  Nigra), 

From  a  bare  knoll  on  the  banks  of  the  lake  near 
Ak-tube,  nothing  can  be  seen  in  the  direction  of  the 
great  Ala-Kul  but  forests  of  reeds,  which  shelter  abun- 
dance of  Bird-life.*

Some  of  the  species  of  the  fish  taken  by  Dr.  Finsch 
in  the  Ala-Kul  were  new  to  him.  That  of  the  com- 
monest occurrence  was  a  species  of  Perch  {Perca 
Schrenkiiy  Kessl.),  which  grows  to  the  length  of  a  foot 
or  more ;  then  the  Schizothorax  Orientalis,  Kessl., 
called  **  Marinka  "  by  the  Cossacks,  a  species  belonging 
to  the  group  of  Barbels  ;  and,  further,  two  species  of 
Diplophysa  belonging  to  the  Loaches,  the  last  named 
Pae§trak  (Z?.  LabiatUy  Kessl.,  and  D.  Strauchi,  Kessl.). 
The  Perch  were  greedily  eaten  by  the  Cossacks  and 
Kirghese,  but  the  Marinka,  supposed  to  be  poisonous, 
were  thrown  aside.  Dr.  Finsch,  however,  boiled  a  fine 
specimen,  two  feet  long,  and  ate  of  it  (the  roe  ex- 
cepted) with  enjoyment,  and  without  ill-effects.  In 
fact,  the  meat  of  this  species  is  generally  used  as  food 

Avocetta\  Stilt  'PXowevs  [Himantoj>us  Candtdus),  Redshanks  {Totanus

flocks  of  Ducks  and  Gulls.  Amongst  the  latter,  besides  the  Black- 
headed  Gull  {Larus  Ridibundus)  appears  its  gigantic  relative,  the 
Great  Black-headed  Gull  (Z.  Ichthyaetus),  whilst  of  Ducks,  besides  the 
common  Wild  Duck,  the  Teal,  the  Pintail,  and  the  Gadwall  (Anas 
Bos c as,  Crecca,  Acuta ^  et  Strefera)  are  met  with  the  Ruddy  and 
Common  Sheldrake  {A,  Rutila  et  'J'adorna),  as  well  as  the  beautiful 
Red-crested  Pochard  {A ,  Rufina),  Cormorants  flit  by  occasionally  in 
small  flocks,  as  well  as  Egrets  {Ardea  Egrettd)  and  Swans ;  and  round 
the  traveller's  tent,  with  their  usual  boldness,  show  themselves  Brah- 
miny  Kites  {Altlvus  Govtnda)y  and  a  Crow,  which  cannot  be  easily 
approached,  but  whose  wings  in  the  sunlight  shimmer  of  a  peculiar 
brown.  Amongst  the  smaller  birds  are  the  Black-headed,  Grey  headed, 
Common  White  (^Motacilla  Alba),  and  even  the  Grey  Wagtail  (J/. 
Boarula).  Amongst  the  reeds  is  heard  the  note  of  the  Grasshopper 
Warbler  {Calamoherpe  Locustella)  and  the  Stone- Chat  {Pratincola 
Rubicola),  Notwithstanding  that  the  district  is  treeless,  the  Turtle 
Dove  (Turtur  Meena)  is  found  there,  and  also,  strange  to  say,  the 
Red-throated  Thrush  (Turdus  Ruficollis),  To  these  must  be  added 
that  beautiful  appearance,  the  Rosy  Starling  (Pastor  Roseus\  and 
numerous  Ortolans  (Emberiza  Hortulana),  whilst  numerous  colonies 
of  Sand  Martins  (Cottle  Riparia)  build  in  the  banks  of  the  lake.

in  Central  Asia,  and  sells  in  Kopal  for  a  halfpenny 
per  pound.  The  Kirghese,  who  carry  out  no  regular 
fishing  operations,  say  that  there  are  no  more  than 
these  four  kinds  of  fish  in  the  Ala-Kul.  The  presence 
therein  of  mollusks  is  testified  to  in  the  sand  on  the 
banks  by  bleached  shells  of  fresh-water  mollusks 
[Limnaa  Planorbzs,  Bithinia,  et  Valvata),  which,  with 
a  Land  Snail  {Helix  Semenoni),  has  been  attributed 
only  to  the  Thian  Shan. 

Before  taking  leave  of  the  fauna  of  the  Ala-Kul 
district,  mention  must  be  made  among  Mammalia  of 
Arctic  Hares  {Lepus  Variabilis),  the  Kara-biruk  Anti- 
lope  [Antilope  subgutturosa),  the  Ibex  {Capra  Sibirica), 
the  Water  Shrew  {Crossopus  Fodiens),  the  Prickly  Hog, 
and  the  Wild  Ass.  This  last  is  found  in  several  part<; 
of  the  Central  Asian  steppes ;  **  Kutan  "  is  the  name 
by  which  the  animal  is  known  to  the  Kirghese.  The 
Mongols  call  it  ''  Dschggetaiy  It  is  probably  the  same 
species  described  by  Pallas  as  Equus  Hemionus  (with 
shorter  ears,  and  consequently  more  horse-like  appear- 

Lacerta  Agilis^  met  with  in  beautiful  varieties  of  colouring,  may  be  re- 
marked two  other  species.  One  species  is  of  a  light  brown  colour  with 
dark  spots  {Eremtas  Variabilis ,  Pall.),  the  other  {Phrynocephalus 
Helioscopus,  Pall.)  is  smaller,  with  very  flatly-pressed  hind  quarters, 
and  short  round  head,  which,  with  a  generally  brownish  colour,  is  distin- 
guished by  beautiful  light  sky  blue  and  rose  coloured  spots,  the  latter 
colour  extending  to  the  lower  side  of  the  tail.  These  little  reptiles, 
which  Dr.  Finsch  thinks  may  fairly  be  regarded  as  the  representative 
Lizards  of  the  Southern  Steppe  region,  as  well  as  parts  of  Mongolia 
and  China,  have  their  abodes  in  holes  apparently  scratched  out  or 
enlarged  by  themselves,  above  which  are  found  little  heaps  of  earth  like 
mole-hills.  The  passages  are  said  to  ))e  frequently  six  or  eight  feet  long, 
and  invariably  terminate  in  a  small  chamber  scarcely  two  inches  high, 
filled  with  dry  grass.  They  feed  chiefly  upon  Beetles,  among  which 
Dorcadias  (Abamukovij  Thorns,  politum,  Dolm.)  are  most  frequent, 
and  around  their  subterraneous  dwellings  are  found  small  woolly  balls 
enclosing  the  elytra  and  other  rejected  fragments  of  beetles'  wings, 
coverings,  and  legs.

ance),  which  is  distinguished  from  the  species  from 
Persia  called  Kulan  {Equus  Onager)  by  the  absence  of 
the  black  cross-stripe  on  the  shoulders.  The  "  Kiang'' 
{Equus  Kiang)  from  Upper  Tibet  would  appear  to  be 
nearly  related,  although  larger.  The  Kulan  is  said  to 
be  untamable,  but  Dr.  Finsch  had  the  opportunity  at 
Omsk  of  describing  and  sketching  two  specimens  that 
had  been  received  from  the  Bekpak-Dala  Steppe  when 
quite  young,  and  had  then  been  suckled  by  a  young 
mare.  Both  the  wild  animals  became  so  accustomed 
to  this  new  phase  of  existence,  that  they  grazed  with 
her  and  other  horses,  and  although  the  one  was  two 
years  old  and  the  other  as  much  as  three  years,  they 
still  had  recourse  to  the  paps  of  their  foster  mother.* 
Having  thus  described  the  Ala-Kul  district  and  its 
fauna,  of  which  latter  so  little  information  is  within 
reach  of  English  students,  and  having  brought  my 
readers  to  the  frontiers  of  the  Semirechia  province  at 
Sergiopol,  I  shall  now  proceed  to  describe  generally 
this  **  land  of  seven  streams  *' 

•  The  prevailing  colour  of  these  animals  was  a  pretty  yellowish 
brown,  but  the  nostrils,  lower  jaw,  throat,  belly,  legs,  and  spots  on 
front  of  the  thighs  were  white.  The  ears  were  also  internally  white, 
with  black-edged  points,  and  these  were  better  formed  than  those  of  the 
ass,  but  longer  than  those  of  a  horse.  The  black,  bushy,  erect  mane 
reached  from  the  back  part  of  the  head  to  the  withers,  and  on  either 
side  of  it  was  a  stripe  of  white  running  down  the  back  and  dwindling 
away  at  the  tail,  which  terminates  in  a  tuft  of  stiif  hairs  reaching  to  the 
point  of  the  hough.  In  winter  the  animal  bears  a  long  and  almost  shaggy 
pelt,  while  its  measurement  may  be  taken  as  follows:  From  tip  of 
nose  to  end  of  tail,  lo  ft.  ;  height  of  shoulder,  3  ft.  10  in. ;  of  crupper, 
3  ft.  11^  in. ;  length  from  nostril  to  point  edge  of  ear,  i  ft.  8^  in.  ;  of  ear 
itself,  7  j  in. ;  from  the  tip  of  the  nose  to  the  back  of  head,  2  ft. ;  length

SEMIRECHINSK,  or  "seven  streamed,"  is  the 
euphonious  adjective  prefixed  to  the  southern- 
most of  the  three  provinces  that  now  make  up  the 
General  Government  of  the  Steppe.  Bounded  on  the 
north  by  the  provinces  of  Akmolinsk  and  Semipola- 
tinsk,  and  on  the  west  by  the  Syr-daria  government, 
the  south  and  eastern  frontiers  of  Semirechia  are  con- 
tiguous to  Chinese  Turkistan  and  Sungaria,  the  area 
of  the  whole  being  134,410  square  miles,  or  the  size  ol 
Belgium  added  to  the  whole  of  the  British  possessions 
in  Europe.  Part  of  its  western  surface  consists  of 
tracts  of  shifting  sands  and  salt  plains,  but  in  the  east 
are  rich  mountain  valleys  with  fertile  black  earth,  and 
mountain  gorges  lying  deep  in  forest  recesses.  Most 
remarkable,  however,  is  the  southern  portion,  the 
mountainous  region  of  the  Thian  Shan,  which,  after 
the   Himalayas,  contains  some  of  the  most   gigantic 


152  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

mountains  in  the  world.  Contiguous  to  the  mountain 
region  is  a  narrow  strip  of  clayey  soil,  that,  when  well 
watered,  is  unusually  fertile.  Beyond  this,  stretching 
out  into  the  plains,  is  the  limitless,  almost  fruitless,  and 
sometimes  sandy  steppe. 

The  three  principal  basins  of  the  province  are  those 
of  lakes  Balkhash,  Ala-Kul,  and  Issik-Kul,  formed  by 
the  following  mountains,  namely :  in  the  north,  the 
Tarbagatai,  already  alluded  to  ;  the  northern  or 
Sungarian  Ala-Tau,  between  Lake  Ala-Kul  and  the 
River  Hi  ;  and,  south  of  that  river,  the  Trans-Ili  Ala- 
I'au,  which  is,  in  fact,  only  the  northern  ridge  of  the 
huge  system  known  as  the  Thian  Shan — this  com- 
pound name  signifying  in  Chinese  the  *'  Celestial 
Mountains,"  called  by  the  Turks  Tengri-dagh,  and  by 
the  Huns,  Kilian, 

This  mountain  system,  whether  regard  be  had  to 
its  area  or  its  length,  the  height  of  its  crests,  the 
abundance  of  its  snows,  or  the  massiveness  of  its 
glaciers,  is  the  grandest  on  the  northern  slope  of  the 
Asiatic  continent.  It  is  not  long  ago  that  we  had 
only  the  most  confusing  and  obscure  information 
regarding  it.  Mr.  Semenoff,  whom  I  mentioned  as 
having  seen  in  Petersburg,  was  the  first  traveller,  not 
a  Siberian,  who  explored  the  Thian  Shan.  This  he 
accomplished  in  1856,  but  since  that  date  a  number  of 
Russian  scientists,  and  a  lady  among  them,  have  pene- 
trated as  far  as  the  Pamir  from  the  north,  whilst  Eng- 
lish explorations,  long  ago  commenced,  have  reached 
the  same  point  from  the  south.  Thus,  thanks  to  the 
labours  of  savants  of  the  two  nations,  this  portion  of 
the  geography  of  Central  Asia  is  now  fast  emerging 
from  obscurity  and  conjecture. 

Under  the  name  Thian  Shan  we  must  understand 


THE  LAND  OF  SEVEN  STREAMS,  i.S3 

the  vast  mountain  system  that  forms  the  watershed 
of  the  rivers  Syr-daria  and  Chu,  of  lakes  Balkhash, 
Ala-Kul,  Ebi-Nor,  and  Ebi-gesun-Nor,  on  the  one  side, 
and,  on  the  other,  the  Upper  Amu,  Lake  Lob-Nor, 
-and  the  River  Tarim  Gol.  Its  entire  length  is  about 
1, 660  miles,  and  its  highest  peaks  everywhere  rise  far 
above  the  snow-line.  The  average  height  of  these 
dominant  peaks  varies  from  16,000  to  18,000  feet, 
and  some  of  them  even  exceed  21,000.  The  entire 
mass  is  estimated  by  R6clus  as  25  times  larger  than 
the  Swiss  Alps,  and  as  forming  a  protuberance  upon 
the  earth's  surface  considerably  larger  than  all  the 
mountains  of  Europe  put  together.  Reckoning  their 
average  width  at  250  miles  only,  the  total  superficies 
of  this  orographic  system  would  cover  400,000  square 
miles,  or  as  much  country  as  the  whole  of  France  and 
the  Iberian  peninsula. 

The  Thian  Shan  range  begins  in  Mongolia,  some- 
what to  the  east  of  the  Chinese  towns  Barkul  and 
Hami,  in  a  simple  ridge  of  rocks  rising  up  from  the 
bed  of  a  dry  sea,  the  Han-hai  of  the  Chinese ;  but  to 
this  ridge,  which  advances  west-south-west,  is  added  a 
second,  then  a  third,  fourth,  and  more  ridges  united  by 
intervening  plateaus.  The  mountains  continue  to  rise, 
enlarge  their  base,  and  finish  by  occupying  from 
north  to  south  a  space  of  about  eight  degrees  of  lati- 
tude. The  peculiarity  of  the  range  is  that  the  system 
on  the  east  extends  at  first  almost  along  an  even 
parallel,  whilst  as  it  advances  westwards  it  opens  out 
fan-like,  and  forms  many  groups.  Between  Barkul  and 
Hami  the  intervals  between  the  several  ranges  scarcely 
exceed  46  miles — that  is,  from  the  foot  of  one  slope  to 
the  foot  of  the  one  opposite — but  to  pass  north  from 
Kashgar  to  the  Hi  valley,  a  distance  of  250  miles  only,

it  is  necessary  to  traverse  no  less  than  eight  snowclad 
ridges. 

Towards  the  middle  of  these  mountains,  the  width 
of  the  plateau  upon  which  the  ranges  rest  diminishes, 
and  the  ridges  become  fewer  in  number.  Its  more 
extensive  ramifications  are  noticeable  at  the  western 
end,  beginning  at  the  sources  of  the  Syr-daria ;  and 
the  colossal  Thian  Shan,  that  already  has  lost  its 
name  at  its  western  extremity,  finally  sinks,  like  a  vast 
ruin,  into  the  plains  of  Turkistan  in  the  form 
of  rocky  spurs,  surrounded  by  salt  marshes  and 
sands.  Kostenko*  gives  a  separate  description  to 
nearly  40  ranges  f  forming  the  Thian  Shan,  some

THE  LAND  OF  SEVEN  STREAMS,  15S 

The  rocks  of  this  system  are  chiefly  metamorphic 
and  crystalline.* 

In  height  the  Thian  Shan  range,  as  already  hinted, 
may  be  reckoned  among  the  chief  mountains  of  the 
globe,  and  the  snow- line  is  generally  at  a  great  alti- 
tude. In  the  northern,  or  Sungarian  Ala-Tau,  it  is 
about  10,000  feet  above  the  sea  ;  on  the  43rd  parallel 
it  generally  rises  to  1 1 ,000  feet,  and  in  the  southern 
groups,  about  the  Zarafshan,  to  more  than  14,000  feet ; 
whilst  on  the  mountains  of  the  Pamir  it  exceeds  15,000 
feet. 

Almost  throughout  the  dominant  range,  and  in 
certain  of  its  spurs,  there  are  glaciers,  the  number  of 
which  is  computed  to  be  not  less  than  8,000.  Espe- 
cially grand  are  those  found  in  the  principal  range, 
called  the  Muz-Tag,  crossed  by  the  famous  Muzart 
Pass.  Snow  bridges  in  the  Thian  Shan  are  often 
met  with  much  below  the  glaciers,  namely,  at  5,000 
feet  or  lower.  These  sometimes  attain  to  a  mile  and 
a  third  in  length,  and    100  feet  in  thickness.     They 

♦  Mushketoif,  who  has  told  us  more,  I  believe,  than  any  one,  of  the 
geology  of  Turkistan,  divides  these  crystalline  rocks  into  three  cate- 
gories. To  the  first  category  belongs  the  granite  group ;  and  to  the 
second  category,  the  dioritic  or  porphyritic  group,  including  diorites, 
aphanites,  and  various  porphyries ;  whilst  to  the  third,  or  most  important 
category,  belong  the  amygdaloid  rocks.  The  mountains  formed  of 
rocks  of  the  granite  group  are  the  most  ancient,  and  the  most  massive, 
and  have  fairly  smooth,  or  at  least  but  little  jagged,  ridges,  whilst 
their  direction  bears  west-north-west.  The  second  group,  the  dioritic 
rocks,  are,  in  comparison  with  the  preceding,  less  widely  distributed. 
The  ranges  composed  of  these  are  far  inferior  in  size  and  continuity 
to  those  of  the  granite  group.  They  lie  principally  in  a  south-westerly 
direction.  Their  outline  is  sharper  and  less  regular,  whilst  they  have 
deep  rocky  gorges  filled  with  masses  of  dSbris  brought  down  by  the 
torrents  that  in  small  cascades  fall  from  height  to  height.  The  moun- 
tains formed  of  rocks  of  the  third  category  lie  chiefly  in  a  north-westerly 
direction.  As  a  rule  they  seldom  reach  the  snow  limit,  and  their 
outlines  are  smooth  and  cupola-shaped.

are  produced  by  avalanches,  and  therefore  the  snow 
in  them  is  mixed  with  rubble,  brought  down  together 
with  the  snow  from  the  surrounding  crags. 

The  valleys  of  the  range  are  of  two  principal  types, 
the  transverse  with  side  windings,  and  the  vast  longi- 
tudinal valleys,  which  may  be  considered  one  of  the 
most  characteristic  features  of  the  Thian  Shan.* 

It  was  thought  for  a  long  time  that  the  range  con- 
tained many  volcanoes.  The  burning  mountains  of 
the  Thian  Shan  were  among  the  **  Traveller's  Tales" 
of  the  last  century.  Mr.  Semenoflf,  however,  declared 
that  Mount  Kullok,  south  of  the  Hi,  was  not,  as 
alleged,  of  volcanic  origin,  and  that  the  solfator  of 
Ketu,  in  the  Hi  valley,  proceeded  in  all  probability 
from  the  combustion  of  coaLf 

Hydrographically  the  Thian  Shan  belongs  to  the 
continental  drainage  of  Asia,  and  in  this  respect  is  of 
less  importance  than  the  neighbouring  but  inferior  Altai 
mountains,  whence  flow  the  great  rivers  of  Siberia. 
Confining  our  attention  for  the  present  to  such  of  its 
streams  as  descend  from  its  northern  slopes  in  Semi- 
rechia,  I  may  observe  that  there  is  some  difference  of 
opinion  as  to  which  are  the  seven  rivers  whence  comes 
the  name  of  the  province.  Of  those  now  flowing  into 
the  Balkhash  the  most  important  are  the  Hi,  the  Karatol, 

*  The  longitudinal  valleys  generally  extend  in  a  direction  parallel  to 
the  main  range  for  sometimes  hundreds  of  miles,  and  besides  their 
direction  these  valleys  have  the  peculiarity  that  their  beginnings  or 
heads  are  formed  of  vast  river  basins,  whilst  their  mouths  form  rugged 
gorges  or  defiles.  In  them  are  nearly  everywhere  noticeable  the  most 
recent  lake  deposits,  taking  the  form  of  horizontal  conglomerate  and 
sandstone. 

t  Other  explorers,  after  Semenoff,  have  denied  the  existence  of 
volcanoes  in  the  alleged  localities.  M.  Mushketoff  also  ha^  come  to 
the  same  conclusion,  and  he  supposes  that  the  other  pseudo-volcanic 
centres  of  the  Thian  Shan,  that  have  not  yet  been  examined  by  Euro- 
peans, may  be  placed  in  the  same  category  of  solfators^ 


THE  LAND  OF  SEVEN  STREAMS.  157 

and  Lepsa,  all  of  which  I  crossed,  and  to  which  I  shall 
allude  in  the  course  of  the  narrative,  whilst  there  is 
another  belonging  to  the  province,  namely,  the  Chu, 
that  ranks  next  in  importance  to  the  Hi. 

The  principal  lakes  of  Semirechia  are  the  Ala-Kul 
— already  alluded  to — the  Balkhash,  and  the  Issik-Kul; 
the  last  being  the  most  interesting  as  having  become 
scientifically  known  to  us  only  during  the  present 
generation.  The  origin  of  Lake  Issik-Kul  is  very 
problematical.  Some  suppose  that,  in  a  distant  geolo- 
gical epoch,  it  was  part  of  the  general  system  of  the 
basins  of  the  Caspian,  Aral,  and  Balkhash.  Again, 
from  the  fact  that,  at  the  bottom  of  the  lake,  buildings 
have  been  discovered,  some  have  supposed  that  the 
k)cality  has  subsided,  and  that  the  hollow  thus  formed 
has  filled  with  water.  Profes3or  Romanoff,  however, 
in  his  careful  investigations,  found  no  traces  of  subsi- 
dence of  the  ground,  though  the  terraces  on  the  shores 
show  that  the  waters  have  receded  by  evaporation. 
Their  former  level  was  at  least  200  feet  higher  than 
now,  and  the  volume  of  water  is  lessening  yearly. 
Popular  traditions  say  that  in  the  now  submerged  town 
was  a  well,  that  one  fine  day  burst  forth  such  a  quantity 
of  water  as  to  engulf  both  the  city  and  its  inhabitants. 
The  lake  is  fed  by  at  least  16  streams  from  the  south 
and  13  from  the  north,  but  has  at  present  no  visible 
outlet.  A  Kirghese  tradition  says  that  the  natives, 
wishing  to  rid  themselves  of  its  waters,  dug  out  the 
canal  of  Kutemaldi,  three  miles  in  length,  at  the  western 
end  of  the  lake,  thereby  connecting  it  with  the  River 
Chu.  If  so,  however,  they  made  a  mistake  in  their 
levels,  for  instead  of  letting  the  waters  of  the  lake  into 
the  river,  the  reverse  took  place. 

The  waters  of  the  lake  are  now  held,  as  in  a  cup,  in 


158  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

a  gigantic  hollow  formed  by  branches  of  the  Thian 
Shan,  the  dimensions  of  the  hollow  being  much  larger 
than  the  surface  of  the  lake,  which,  at  a  height  of 
5,300  feet,  covers  3,104  square  miles,  or  ten  times  the 
extent  of  the  Lake  of  Geneva.  The  northern  shore 
is  known  as  Kungei — that  is,  **  the  side  turned  to  the 
sun," — and  the  southern  shore  as  Terskeu  **the  side 
turned  to  the  shade."  The  shores  of  the  lake  are 
desolate  and  barren.  Its  pellucid  waters,  blue  on  the 
shore  and  of  a  deeper  shade  further  out,  extend  beyond 
the  circle  of  the  horizon.  The  distant  shore  is  hidden 
by  the  curvature  of  the  surface,  but  the  mountains  rise 
above,  their  bases  half  hidden  by  vapours  reddened  in 
the  sunlight,  and  lifting  snowy  peaks  into  what  is  usually 
a  cloudless  sky.  An  eternal  silence  reigns  supreme 
whilst  on  the  reddish  strand  there  is  scarcely  a  hut, 
or  on  the  waters  a  skiff,  to  indicate  the  existence  of 
man. 

There  are  certain  localities,  however,  for  the  nomads, 
and  also  for  agriculture,  the  eastern  shore  of  the  lake 
being  more  suitable  for  habitation  than  the  western. 
Hence,  during  the  last  few  years,  this  has  been  dotted 
with  some  half-dozen  Russian  settlements. 

Issik-Kul  is  considered  to  be  more  than  1,000  feet 
deep  where  the  shores  are  precipitous  ;  but  where  the 
banks  are  low  a  man  can  wade  into  it  two-thirds  of  a 
mile.  The  water  is  brackish  and  almost  unfit  for  use  ; 
cattle  do  not  drink  it.  The  lake  has  no  islands,  but 
numerous  shoals.  In  consequence  of  its  general  free- 
dom from  ice,  the  Kirghese  call  it  Issik-Kul ^  the 
Chinese ye-/Iat\  both  meaning  **the  warm  lake."  To 
the  Mongols  and  Kalmuks  it  is  known  under  the 
name  Temuru-Nor,  or  the  ferruginous  lake,  because  of 
the  large  quantity  of  black  ore  covering  the  bottom, 


THE  LAND   OF  SEVEN  STREAMS.  159 

that  is  thrown  up  on  the  shores  in  the  form  of  sand. 
The  Kara-Kirghese  collect  the  ore,  and  extract  iron 
therefrom.  A  knife  thus  made,  of  extremely  primitive 
manufacture,  was  given  me  in  Vierny,  but  I  unfortu- 
nately lost  it.  The  Russian  Bishop  of  the  diocese 
showed  me,  too,  among  his  antiquities,  a  bronze  instru- 
ment, found  in  the  lake,  somewhat  resembling  the  head 
of  a  large  hammer,  but  probably  made  for  a  small 
hatchet.  Its  upper  surface  measured  4 J  inches  long, 
by  I J  in.  wide,  and  i  in.  deep  in  the  thiclcest  part, 
through  which  was  driven  a  longitudinal  hole  large 
enough  to  admit  the  fore  or  middle  finger,  but  it  was 
not  easy  to  see  how  it  would  be  hefted.  Besides 
objects  of  this  kind,  the  waves  cast  up  human  bones 
and  skulls,  as  well  as  household  utensils  and  bricks. 
Dr.  Schuyler  observes  that  on  the  shores  of  this  lake 
old  Chinese  maps  place  the  city  of  Tchi-gu,  and  on 
the  Catalan  map  of  1375,  there  is  marked  on  the 
southern  shore  a  Nestorian  monastery,  containing  the 
bones  of  St.  Matthew.  These  ruins  have  not  yet 
been  scientifically  investigated,  but  General  Kolpa- 
kovsky,  besides  tracing  brick  walls  under  water  in  the 
lake,  drew  out  a  large  stone  on  which  was  carved  a 
human  face.  Also  it  may  be  noticed  that,  in  1847, 
before  the  advent  of  the  Russians,  two  ornamented 
copper  kettles  were  found  by  the  Kirgheseonthe  south 
shore,  and  presented  to  the  Khan  of  Khokand.  Only 
four  kinds  of  fish,  Carp,  Usman,  Marnik,  and  Bream, 
have  as  yet  been  found  in  the  lake,  but  of  these  there 
is  abundance,  though  neither  Kirghese  nor  Russians 
catch  them. 

The  climate  of  Semirechia  is  not  so  dry  as  some 
other  districts  of  Central  Asia.  The  northern  portions 
of  the  province,  about  Sergiopol  and   Kopal,  have  a 


i6o  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

climate  fairly  cool — not  sufficiently  warm,  in  fact,  for  the 
more  delicate  vegetable  growths — though  further  south 
the  heat  is  sufficient  for  apricots  and  vines.  In  the 
plains  trees,  bushes,  and  grasses  grow  only  by  means 
of  irrigation,  but  in  the  mountainous  region,  where  are 
streams,  woods  appear.  Still,  even  here,  there  is  an 
insufficiency  of  moisture.  Hence  the  forest  growth 
extends  only  to  certain  spots  along  the  northern  and 
north-western  slopes  in  the  gorges  of  streams  that 
issue  from  beneath  the  snow.  Peaks,  not  snowclad, 
and  the  southern  slopes  are  bare.* 

Numerous  wild  animals  inhabit  Semirechia,  and 
much  credit  is  due  to  Russian  naturalists  for  their 
classification  of  collections  of  fauna  made  by  various 
scientific  travellers. "f  To  confine  ourselves  here  to 
the  mammals  of  the  province,  we  may  notice  that 
there  are  found  therein  seven  species  of  Bats,  the 
Long-eared   Hedgehog,  and  the  White-clawed  Bear. 

*  The  commonest  and  most  widely  distributed  tree  is  the  spruce  fir, 
extending  from  the  western  limits  of  the  province  to  the  eastern  end  of 
the  Thian  Shan.  Its  straight  stem  attains  a  height  of  from  70  to  90  feet, 
and  its  branches,  gradually  shortening  towards  tlie  top,  give  the  tree  the 
appearance  of  a  pyramid.  Its  cones,  the  size  of  one's  fist,  are  of  dark 
blue,  and  hang  at  the  end  of  long  stems  quite  vertically.  By  far  the 
most  richly  wooded  portions  of  the  province,  and,  indeed,  of  the  whole 
Thian  Shan,  are  those  known  under  the  name  of  the  Muz-Tag.  Here, 
besides  the  fir,  are  the  birch,  the  apple,  willow,  mountain  ash,  and  poplar. 
But  the  deciduous  trees  are  completely  lost  among  the  conifers.  The 
fir  forests  in  Semirechia  sometimes  extend  for  tens  of  miles,  but,  in  the 
European  sense  of  the  word,  they  can  be  hardly  called  forests.  The  trees 
stand  apart,  seldom  afford  the  pleasing  shade  of  woods,  and  every- 
where allow  pedestrians  and  horsemen  room  for  free  passage.  The  fir 
grows  in  a  region  6,000  to  9,000  feet  above  the  sea ;  the  birch  between 
3,000  and  8,000,  and  the  juniper  between  5,000  and  10,000,  except  in 
the  Alai,  Turkistan,  and  Hissar  ranges,  where  it  is  found  a  thousand 
feet  higher. 

tOne  of  these  travellers  is  Dr.  N.  Severtsoff,  whose  **  Mammals  o 
Turkistan  *'  was  translated  in  the  Annals  of  Natural  History  for 
1876.

This  last  varies  his  diet  according  to  locality,  feed- 
ing in  some  parts  on  Marmots,  disturbing  their  winter 
sleep  by  digging  them  out  of  their  holes,  and  thus 
unearthing  more  than  he  eats.  In  the  Western  Thian 
Shan  he  feeds  principally  on  fruit — apples,  grapes, 
and  walnuts  ;  but  about  Vierny,  since  the  advent  of 
the  Cossacks,  Bruin  has  manifested  a  sympathetic 
interest  in  the  progress  of  apiculture  by  diligently 
emptying  the  colonists'  hives.  To  these  animals  must 
be  added  the  Badger,  Otter,  and  some  other  species 
of  Mustelidae,  including  Pole-cats,  Weasels,  the  Stoat 
or  Ermine,  and  three  species  of  Marten.  Of  these 
last,  as  well  as  of  a  Lynx,  I  was  able  to  secure  in 
Vierny  the  skins  and  skeletons,  all  of  which  are  now 
in  the  British  Museum.  The  Wolf  is  met  with  almost 
everywhere,  and  a  Wild  Dog  is  found  up  to  the  snow- 
line, while  three  species  of  Fox  occur,  as  also  the 
Tiger,  Snow-Leopard,  Cheetah,  and  other  Cats.  The 
salt  plains  are  frequented  by  the  Short-tailed  Souslik, 
as  well  as  many  other  Rodents,  among  them  several 
species  of  Mouse,  Vole,  and  Hamster,  four  of  Jerboa, 
and,  at  greater  altitude,  the  Hairy-Nosed  Porcupine. 
To  these  should  be  added  the  Persian  Gazelle,  the 
Saiga  Antilope,  the  Siberian  Ibex,  the  Siberian  Roe- 
buck, and  the  Maral  Stag — this  last  closely  resembling 
the  Canadian  Wapiti.  There  are  some  other  animals 
also  of  greatest  interest,  to  which  I  shall  allude 
hereafter. 

Meanwhile,  having  described  the  natural  features  of 
the  province,  I  shall  proceed  to  speak  of  it  in  relation 
to  man.

Ethnology  of  province. — Kalmuks  and  Taranchis. — Population  of  Semi- 
rechia,  by  races  and  classes  :  their  habitations,  agriculture,  and 
cattle. — Cossack  and  peasant  colonists. — Taranchi  refugee  settlers, 
and  Russian  efforts  for  their  welfare. — The  Orthodox  Christian 
Brotherhood:  its  constitution  and  missionary  operations  in  Sarkan. 
— Its  Kalmuk  school  in  Viemy. — Contemplated  Issik-Kul  mission. 
— Religious  and  educational  aifairs  of  the  province. 

THE  province  of  Semirechia  is  of  exceptional 
interest  to  the  ethnologist.  I  met  in  the 
market-place  in  the  capital  men  belonging  to  seven 
different  races,  representing  Russians,  Tatars,  Sarts, 
Kirghese,  Dungans,  Chinese,  Taranchis,  and  Kalmuks. 
I  made  the  acquaintance  of  these  last  in  visiting  a 
Kalmuk  tent  in  the  Hi  valley.*  They  are,  for  the 
most   part,    nomads,    being    excellent   shepherds   and 

•  They  are  of  Mongol  race,  and  are  somewhat  below  middle  height, 
with  flat  faces,  forehead  wide  and  arched,  scanty  eyelashes,  the  super- 
ciliary protuberance  but  slightly  developed,  eyes  very  oblique,  the  nose 
wide,  short,  and  flat ;  the  cheek  bones  and  zygomatic  arches  very  pro- 
minent ;  large  mouth,  with  coarse,  colourless  lips,  set  in  a  half-idiotic 
and  inexpressively  sad  smile  ;  large  and  sound  teeth,  white  in  men,  but 
stained  among  the  women  ;  ears  unusually  developed  and  slightly  pro- 
jecting; the  face  flat  and  square,  and  the  head  very  bulky.  They  have 
black,  coarse,  and  glossy  hair,  the  unshaven  part  of -which  is  twisted  into 
a  queue,  scanty  beards,  and  smooth,  yellowish  skin.  The  shoulders  are 
broad,  arms  long,  hanging  lazily  by  the  side,  the  legs  crooked  and 
bowed,  and  the  voice  harsh,  sharp,  and  strongly  aspirate.     To  these

clever  horsemen,  and  roam  about  the  Vierny  and  Issik- 
Kul  districts.  They  easily  bear  a  severe  climate,  con- 
tinued cold,  and  general  poverty,  numbering  throughout 
the  province  about  25,000.  They  are  Buddhists,  and 
the  women  go  unveiled  ;  but  one  whose  acquaintance 
I  made  in  the  tent  was  anything  but  beautiful.  The 
Taranchis  are  of  Turkish  origin,  and  agriculturists, 
deriving  their  name  from  taran,  millet.  They  were  de- 
ported from  Chinese  Turkistan  to  the  number  of  6,000 
families,  and  settled  in  the  Hi  valley  a  century  and  a 
half  ago.  In  1834  the  number  had  increased  to  8,000, 
whilst  now  as  many  as  36,000  families  are  living  in 
Semirechia  alone.*  The  Taranchis  are  Muhammadans, 
but  their  women,  nevertheless,  are  not  veiled.  Their 
language  is  said  to  be  an  offshoot  from  the  old  Uigur 
dialect,  and  to  be  more  purely  Turkish  than  any 
Turkish  book  printed  in  Constantinople.  I  heard  of 
no  books  printed  by  the  natives,  but  there  fell  into 
my  hands  a  Taranchi  pamphlet,  issued,  I  think,  by 
the  Russians,  which,  on  presenting  at  the  British 
Museum,  I  was  told  was  in  Eastern  Turki.  Their 
manner  of  life  resembles  that  of  the  Sarts,  to  the 
ethnological    characteristics    of    whom,    as    of    other 

must  be  added  what  a  Russian  writer  calls  "a  disagreeable  smell  of 
garlic,  snufF,  and  sweat."  The  Kalmuks  are  very  angry  if  irritated ; 
usually  timid,  good-tempered,  and  generous ;  but,  despising  physical 
labour,  are  excessively  indolent. 

*  The  Taranchi  is  of  good  height,  the  forehead  tolerably  high  and 
wide,  with  a  marked  protuberance  over  the  eye  ;  the  eyebrows  are 
arched,  and  often  abundant ;  the  depression  separating  the  nose  from 
the  glabella,  or  space  between  the  eyebrows,  not  deep  ;  the  eyes  very 
little  elevated  at  the  comers,  medium  and  arched  nose,  rather  large 
mouth,  medium  and  sound  teeth,  the  cheek-bones  slightly  prominent, 
the  face  square,  and  the  ears  of  middle  size  and  standing  out.  The 
hair  is  soft  and  dark,  the  beard  generally  scanty  and  darker.  The  skin 
is  usually  white,  especially  the  parts  not  exposed ;  and  when  dark,  it 
has  not  the  olive  hue  that  characterizes  the  Kashgarians.

nationalities  residing  in  the  province,  I  shall  have 
occasion  to  refer  hereafter. 

A  census  of  the  population  of  Semirechia  had  been 
taken  four  years  before,  but  not  printed.  I  was 
favoured,  however,  with  an  official  copy  of  statistics  in 
manuscript  (though  apparently  incomplete  so  far  as  the 
Taranchi  settled  population  is  concerned),  from  which 
it  appears  that  in  1878  the  inhabitants  numbered 
609,000,  of  whom  the  males  exceeded  the  females  by 
36,000  ;  the  most  populous  districts  being  those  of 
Vierny  in  the  south,  where  the  Russians  form  8^  per 
cent.,  and  Sergiopol  in  the  north,  where  they  form  2  j 
per  cent,  of  the  entire  population.* 

The  occupation  of  the  nomads  of  course  is  chiefly 
connected  with  cattle,  but  necessity  has  compelled 
some,  and  opportunity  induced  others,  in  certain  places 
to  cultivate  wheat,   barley,   and   millet,   to  which   the 

*  In  the  districts  of  Tokmak  and  Issik-Kul,  the  Russians  form  less 
than  I  per  cent  of  the  population.  If  next  we  take  the  social  stand- 
ing of  the  settled  population,  we  find  the  landowners  number  7,396 ; 
Cossacks,  21,085;  peasants,  14,128;  clergy  and  their  families,  168'; 
nobles  or  upper  classes,  960 ;  merchants,  3,203  ;  mechanics  and  handi- 
craftsmen, 1,166 ;  agricultural  labourers,  5,628  ;  and  of  other  labourers, 
2,055.  T^^  upper  classes  among  the  nomads  are  ranged  as  follows  : — 
Sultan,  or  ruling  families,  1,884  I  Telengutes,  1,139  ;  Iginchis,  35,858  ; 
and  of  mullahs  or  priests,  1,639.  ^^®  great  disproportion  between  the 
settled  and  the  nomad  populations  will  be  apparent  when  it  is  observed 
that  the  former  live  in  8,000  houses,  and  the  latter  in  126,000  tents. 
Whilst,  therefore,  the  nomads  roam  over  the  whole  province,  divided 
into  78  volosts,  the  settled  population  is  found  in  a  few  towns,  of  which 
the  principal  are  Vierny,  Tokmak,  Kopal,  Sergiopol,  and  Karakol,  each 
the  chief  town  of  one  of  the  five  uyezds  into  which  the  province  is 
divided,  also  Lepsinsk  and  Iliisk,  whilst  my  statistics  give  the  names 
besides  of  64  villages  and  hamlets.  The  houses  are  of  stone  and  wood 
in  about  equal  proportions,  and,  apart  from  dwelling-houses,  there  are 
throughout  the  province  9  caravanserais,  or  native  inns,  ^^  schools, 
5  Muhammadan  colleges,  24  churches  and  monasteries,  8  mosques 
(also  6  hospitals  in  1869).  There  were  besides  of  industrial  buildings, 
341  windmills,  24   stamping  mills,  2  tanneries,  3  tallow  and  2  soap

settled  agriculturists  add  rye,  oats,  and  clover.*  The 
seed  sown  in  1878  all  over  the  province  amounted  to 
5,300  tons,  and  the  harvest  to  47,000,  thus  yielding  on 
an  average  nearly  a  ninefold  crop.  Of  this  amount 
the  nomads  raised  only  7,211  tons,  the  major  part 
being  produced  by  the  settlers  ;  but  when  we  come  to 

factories;  i  match  factory,  3  wine  factories,  i  brandy  distillery,  i 
brewery,  and  13  bazaars. 

The  following  details  I  give  in  full,  as,  I  believe,  they  have  not 
appeared  elsewhere : —

ten  times  the  number  of  animals  owned  by  the  others, 
out  of  which,  however,  during  the  year  no  less  than 
39,000  died.* 

The  Russian  settlers  in  Semirechia  are  of  two  kinds, 
the  Cossacks  and  the  colonists,  some  of  the  latter 
being  Russians  and  some  natives.  The  Cossacks 
were  brought,  at  the  time  of  the  Russian  conquest,  both 
to  till  the  soil  and  to  defend  it.  They  were,  for  the 
most  part,  from  Siberia,  descended  originally  from 
Great  Russians.  The  Russian  peasant  colonists,  on 
the  other  hand,  are  descended  from  Little  Russians, 
though  coming  immediately  in  large  proportion  from 
the  government  of  Tobolsk.t

♦  The  localities  occupied  by  the  emigrants  have  followed  the  advance 
of  the  Russian  armies  from  Semipolatinsk  to  Sergiopol,  then  to  the 
districts  about  Kopal  and  Lepsinsk,  and  so  on  past  the  slopes  of  the 
northern  and  southern  Ala-Tau  to  the  eastern  shores  of  Issik-Kul.  The 
flow  of  new  settlers  year  by  year  has  rendered  it  difficult  sometimes  for 
the  local  government  to  set  apart  land  for  their  use,  and  it  is  now  pro- 
posed to  send  the  colonists  further  south  into  the  rich  valleys  of  the 
interior  of  the  Thian  Shan.  The  proportions  of  the  emigration  towards 
Semirechia  may  be  estimated  from  the  fact  that  since  the  establishment 
of  the  Turkistan  district  in  1867,  the  number  of  Russians  has  increased 
from  30,000  in  20  settlements,  to  44,089  in  65  settlements.  Of  these 
20,641  belong  to  the  Cossack  element,  who  form  the  militia  of  the 
province,  and  live  in  military  posts  or  stations,  by  the  side  of  which 
there  sometimes  happens  to  stand  a  peasant  settlement,  but  the  charac- 
ter of  the  buildings  is  as  distinct  as  are  the  personal  qualities  of  the 
inmates. 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  SEMIRECHIA,  167 

The  exterior  aspect  of  the  stations  lis  very  much 
like  that  of  a  Russian  military  colony  elsewhere,  the 
houses  of  piled  logs,  possessing  no  gardens,  and  on 
the  whole  presenting  a  dreary  appearance.  The 
peasant  cottages,  on  the  other  hand,  are  almost  hidden 
amid  orchards  and  gardens.  The  colonists,  on  arriv- 
ing, soon  settle  down  and  habituate  themselves  to  their 
new  circumstances,  and,  as  a  rule,  become  as  wealthy 
as  the  Cossack  militia  remain  poor.* 

One  serious  inconvenience  with  the  Semirechia 
colonists  is  their  ceaseless  strife  with  the  nomads  about 
water  and  about  land,  and  the  local  government  is 
much  taken  up  with  keeping  the  peace.  Questions 
relating  to  boundary  lines  between  the  nomads  and 
settlers  lead  to  numerous  feuds,  the  opposing  parties 
in  which,  however,  do  not  foster  lasting  enmity,  sc 
that  serious  collisions  betwixt  them  do  not  often  ensue. 
Of  late  the  local  government  has  endeavoured,  with 
a  view  to  increasing  the  army  of  the  province,  to 
induce  the  peasants  to  enter  the  Cossack  militia,  and 
certain  exemptions  have  been  offered,  but  with  only 

^  To  judge  by  what  Colonel  Kostenko  says  of  the  Semirechia  colonists 
in  general,  and  by  what  Mr.  Delmar  Morgan  writes  of  those  in  the 
vicinity  of  Lepsinsk  in  particular,  it  would  appear  that  these  latter  had 
the  opportunity  of  making  of  their  terrain  an  earthly  paradise.  On 
emigrating  from  Russia  they  received  free  grants  of  land,  with  immu- 
nity from  taxation  and  military  service  for  15  years.  They  felled 
timber,  and  built  themselves  mazankas^  or  homesteads,  raised  com, 
and  kept  bees,  their  chief  complaint  being  that  they  could  not  always 
find  a  market  for  their  surplus  produce.  But  of  late  years  winters  have 
been  severer  (partly,  perhaps,  from  the  indiscreet  and  wholesale  destruc- 
tion of  forests,  which  is  now  forbidden),  harvests  have  failed,  and  com- 
plaints, Mr.  Morgan  says,  have  been  made  ;  a  similar  condition  of 
things,  I  suspect,  to  that  I  heard  of  on  the  Amur,  where  peasant 
colonists  were  given  land,  immunity  from  taxes  for  a  term  of  years, 
stock  and  farming  implements  to  start  in  life,  after  which  they  liked 
their  state  of  tutelage  so  well  that,  on  its  expiration,  they  came 
begging  that  it  might  be  renewed. 


1 68  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

partial    success,    for    volunteers    have    been    few    in 
number. 

But  besides  the  Russian  peasants  who  have  become 
colonists  by  choice,  and  the  Cossacks,  who  are  some- 
times made  new  colonists  without  their  choice,  there  is 
a  third  class  of  settlers  in  Semirechia, — natives  from  the 
neighbouring  countries, — who,  sensible  of  the  greater 
security  to  life  and  property,  as  well  as  lighter  taxation, 
choose  to  be  under  the  government  of  the  Tsar  rather 


than  that  of  their  Asiatic  rulers.  The  Taranchis  are  a 
noticeable  instance  of  this,  and  their  treatment  by  the 
Russians  presents  many  points  of  interest. 

During  the  civil  wars  of  the  Kuldja  district  in  1867 
some  hundreds  of  Taranchis  crossed  the  Russian 
border  for  protection,  to  whom  the  authorities  gave 
land  as  to  their  own  colonists.  One  of  the  spots  chosen 
for  this  purpose  was  the  Sarkansky  district,  where 
some  800  took  up  their  abode,  each  family  receiving 
agricultural  implements  and  seed,  and  £6  los.  in  cash, 
with  the   result    that,   thanks   to   their  semi- Chinese 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  SEMIRECHIA,  169 

industry  and  good  tillage,  they  developed  into  a  thriv- 
ing colony. 

The  Russians  determined,  moreover,  to  seek  their 
intellectual  and  spiritual  welfare.  Taranchis,  to  the 
number  of  800,  were  speedily  baptized,  and  so  became 
what  the  Russians  call  **  converts " ;  not  that  they 
understood  the  new  religion  they  had  embraced,  but 
professed  to  have  done  with  Buddhism,  and  were  will- 
ing to  be  instructed.  Accordingly  an  association  was 
formed  in  Vierny,  called  the  Orthodox  Christian 
Brotherhood,*  and  in  1868  a  priest-schoolmaster  sent 
to  Sarkan.  The  priest's  affairs,  however,  seem  to 
have  gone  badly,  for  his  miserably  small  stipend  of  £^^0 
a  year  for  some  reason  did  not  reach  him,  and  he  was 
well-nigh  reduced  to  beggary.  After  establishing  a 
school  and  a  chapel  he  left,  and  was  succeeded  by 
another  priest  named  Pokrovsky,  who,  in  spite  of 
many  obstacles,  was  able  to  make  some  little  headway. 

*  The  following  is  a  condensed  account  of  the  rules  of  this  Brother- 
hood : — 

1.  The  Orthodox  Brotherhood  imposes  upon  itself  the  task  (i)  of 
•spreading  and  developing  moral  and  spiritual  enlightenment,  and  useful 
knowledge  among  the  population  of  Semirechia;  (2)  of  helping  the 
•clergy  in  arranging  and  decorating  churches,  and  providing  books ; 
(3)  supporting  missionaries  and  teachers ;  (4)  helping  the  old  and 
orphans,  and  burying  the  poor;  and  (5)  constructing  industrial  schools. 

2.  The  Brotherhood  is  established  in  connection  with  the  Church  of 
the  Holy  Martyrs,  Faith,  Hope,  and  Charity,  and  their  mother  Sophia, 
in  the  town  of  Vierny.  In  this  church  the  Brotherhood  has  a  banner 
with  paintings,  with  historical  data  connected  with  Semirechia,  where 
prayers  for  the  Brotherhood  are  continually  said. 

3.  The  Brotherhood  is  under  the  care  of  the  bishop  and  the  civil  head 
-of  the  province. 

4.  Persons  of  orthodox  faith,  irrespective  of  sex  or  calling,  may 
become  "  brothers."  The  right  of  voting  is  restricted  to  annual  or  life 
subscribers. 

5.  Its  affairs  are  entrusted  to  an  honorary  council  of  from  six  to  eight 
brothers,  with  a  president. 

6.  7,  8,  9.  These  rules  refer  to  meetings  of  the  Council,  the  conduct- 


170  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

I  am  indebted  for  information  concerning  this 
Sarkan  colony  to  the  independent  testimony  of  a 
Russian  officer,  Friedrichs,,  published  in  a  Russian 
pamphlet  respecting  the  Taranchi  emigrants,  and 
given  me  in  Vierny.  The  colonel  speaks  of  the  neat- 
ness of  the  cottages  built  in  Chinese  style,  and  of  the 
industry  and  good  moral  conduct  of  the  people.  In 
the  garden  they  cultivated  some  plants  unknown  to 
him,  and  their  fields  brought  forth  so  abundantly  that 
the  Cossacks  went  to  Sarkan  for  supplies.  There 
were  two  schools  for  boys  and  girls,  where  the  children 
(for  the  most  part  Taranchis)  were  taught  the  Russian 
language  and  arithmetic.  The  colonel  adds  that  these 
emigrants  received  the  orthodox  faith  without  hesita- 
tion, and  he  argues  thence  in  favour  of  extending  such 
efforts  to  the  Kuldja  province. 

I  am  not  aware  that  the  Brotherhood  ever  extended 
its  operations  into  Kuldja,  but  in  1871  it  was  deter- 
mined to  open  a  school  in  Vierny  for  Kalmuk  Christian 
boys  ;  and  in  connection  with  it  was  established  a  home 
for  ten  scholars,  sons  of  recently-baptized  Kalmuks. 
This  was  mainly  due  to  the  energetic  co-operation  of 
Archbishop  Putintseff,  whose  example  was  soon  followed 
by  Father  Bielajarsky,  the  priest  of  the  town  church^ 
He  established  the  asylum  in  part  of  his  own  house, 

ing  of  its  correspondence,  treatment  of  claims,  and  the  annual  meeting 
of  the  Brotherhood,  at  which  the  accounts  are  to  be  presented  after 
examination  by  auditors,  and  after  presentation  to  the  military  governor 
of  the  province. 

10.  The  funds  to  be  maintained  by  voluntary  contributions,  to  which 
a  note  is  added  that  the  Brotherhood  does  not  refuse  donations  from 
professors  of  other  religions  interested  in  the  work. 

11,  12.  A  collecting  box  having  been  placed  in  the  church,  and  books 
distributed  to  the  members,  these  rules  look  forward  to  the  possibility 
of  the  Brotherhood  acquiring  real  property,  and  provide  for  it,  as  also 
for  possible  surplus  funds,  to  be  placed  in  banks  at  interest. 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  SEMIRECHIA,  171 

and  opened  the  school  under  his  own  supervision,  his 
daughter  Catherine  being  the  teacher.  The  military 
governor  of  the  province  approved  the  rules  drawn 
up  by  the  priest,  the  aims  of  which  were  to  regulate 
religious  and  practical  education  for  the  scholars.* 

This  work,  however,  was  not  continued  for  long  at 
Vierny,  nor  am  I  aware  whether  anything  of  the  kind 
now  exists  at  Sarkan.  Various  accounts  of  the  labours 
of  the  priest  Pokrovsky  in  this  latter  district  were 
communicated  by  him  to  the  Turkistan  papers  from 
1 87 1  to  1875,  but  I  read  of  Mr.  Pokrovsky  as 
priest  of  the  hospital  church  in  Tashkend  in  1877, 
from  whose  notes  and  papers  the  pamphlet  to  which 
I  have  referred  was  compiled.  Its  author,  Mr.  N.  P. 
Ostroumoff,  states  that  when  he  returned  to  Vierny  in 
1878,  he  heard  from  the  bishop  the  sad  news  that  the 
Kalmuk  school  was  closed,  and  that  the  Brotherhood 
existed  only  on  paper. 

This  latter  remark,   I  presume,  is  not  to  be  taken 

♦  The  course  comprised  writing  and  arithmetic,  theology,  prayers, 
and  singing,  reading  in  Russian  and  Sclavonic  ;  and  instruction  in 
handicrafts  was  to  be  added  when  the  means  of  the  Society  would  allow. 

Teaching  was  carried  on  daily,  from  the  middle  of  September  to  the 
beginning  of  June  (Saints'  days  excepted),  for  two  hours  in  the  morning, 
this  time  being  apportioned  to  two  lessons,  with  the  practice  of  gymnas- 
tics between.  After  dinner  the  time  was  devoted  to  preparation  and 
repetition  of  lessons,  and  to  recreation.  In  summer  the  pupils  were,  for 
the  most  part,  engaged  in  learning  useful  occupations  and  trades.  The 
rules  provide  that  the  children  shall  read  the  ordinary  prayers  morning 
and  evening,  before  and  after  study,  and  before  and  after  dinner  ;  and 
also  attend  church  on  festivals,  weather  permitting.  Nothing  definite 
is  laid  down  in  the  rules,  but  it  was  believed  by  the  author  of  the 
pamphlet  that  the  children  also  observed  fasts,  attended  confession, 
and  received  the  Sacrament  according  to  the  regulations  of  the  Russian 
Church.  The  maintenance  of  this  school  and  home  was  contributed  to 
by  the  Brotherhood,  who  paid  the  teacher  a  small  salary,  provided 
clothes  for  the  inmates,  and  allowed  for  each  6j".  M.  per  month  for 
board.  At  the  public  examination  in  June,  1875,  the  progress  of  the 
pupils  not  only  gave  satisfaction,  but  surpassed  expectation. 


172  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

quite  literally,  though  it  appears  that  the  income  of  the 
Brotherhood  in  1878  amounted  to  £16$  only,  and  in 
the  following  year  further  decreased  to  ;^i20,  out  of 
which  latter  amount  a  small  sum  was  sent  to  Sarkan 
for  poor  Dungan  apprentices.  I  heard,  during  my 
stay  in  Semirechia,  of  no  existing  church  missions. 
Archbishop  Alexander  told  me,  however,  that  they 
had  in  contemplation-  the  establishment  of  a  mission 
at  Lake  Issik-Kul.  The  missionaries  were  to  be 
monks,  who  ate  no  meat,  and  their  efforts  were 
to  be  directed  to  the  nomads,  who  ate  no  bread ; 
and  thus  the  neighbourhood  of  the  lake  had  been 
chosen  that  these  spiritual  pastors  might  largely 
subsist  on  fish.  At  first  their  mission  was  to  be 
of  a  scientific  character,  and  afterwards  religious ; 
the  Kara  Kirghese,  according  to  the  Archbishop, 
being  not  real  Muhammadans,  and  not  knowing  the 
Koran,  though  they  register  themselves  as  good 
Mussulmans. 

I  have  no  further  details  concerning  the  religious 
and  educational  affairs  of  the  province  in  general  of 
a  recent  date,  but  observe  that,  in  1869,  there  were  in 
the  Kopal  uyezd  8  raskolniks.  Perhaps  they  were 
Dukhobortsi,  for  I  observe  a  statement  in  the  pam- 
phlet about  Taranchi  emigrants  at  Sarkan,  that  a 
Cossack  who  had  become  one  of  the  Dukhobortsi  had 
destroyed  his  ikons,  and  told  the  newly-baptized 
emigrants  that  in  them  they  worshipped  demons,  and 
not  God.  Also  in  the  town  of  Karakol,  in  1 869,  there 
were  5  Romanists  and  i  Armeno-Gregorian  ;  but 
otherwise  all  the  Christian  population  appear  to  have 
been  of  the  orthodox  faith.  Further,  from  the  Turki- 
Stan  Annual  for  1872,  it  appears  that  the  schools  of 
the  province  were  of  three  kinds,  and  kept   by    the 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  SEMIRECHIA.  173 

communes,  by  religious  houses,  and  for  the  poor/ 
Having  thus  treated  generally  of  the  **  Land  of  Seven 
Streams,*'  I  shall  proceed  to  describe  my  journey 
through  it. 

*  In  6  town  schools  20  teachers  instructed  t^"^^  boys  and  82  girls ; 
whilst  in  II  district  schools  16  teachers  instructed  326  boys,  but  only 
6  giris ;  giving  for  the  province  17  places  of  education,  34  teachers, 
659  boys,  and  88  giris.

I-ROM  SERGIOPOL    TO  ALTYN-IMMEL.  175 

then  pushed  on  to  Taldi-Kuduk.  Here  a  few  soldiers, 
with  a  handful  of  prisoners  on  the  march,  had  put  up 
for  the  night,  the  soldiers  stretching  themselves  on 
the  ground  in  Central  Asian  fashion  outside  the  post- 
house.  At  the  first  station  the  post-master  bought 
the  whole  of  the  books  I  offered  for  his  selection,  and 
now  these  soldiers  readily  purchased  more ;  after 
which,  our  horses  being  ready,  we  posted  all  night. 


passed  Kyzyl- Kiy  and  Little  Ayaguz,  and  in  the 
morning  reached  Djus  Agach.  It  was  a  picket  of  the 
most  desolate  character — the  most  miserable  station 
we  had  seen — a  tumbledown  house  in  the  desert. 
Here  we  breakfasted,  and  took  our  morning  wash,  but 
both  under  difficulties.  One  of  the  inconveniences  o( 
post  travelling  in  Asiatic  Russia  is  the  absence  of  good 
lavatory  accommodation.  The  common  method  among 
the    Russian    peasants    of    washing    the    hands    is    to 


176  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

place  them  beneath  a  bowl  of  water  fixed  at  a  height^ 
put  of  which  a  stream  trickles.  One  accustomed,  there- 
fore, to  the  orthodox  "tub"  wherein  to  splash  about 
finds  himself  inconveniently  restricted  in  his  toilet. 
Moreover,  as  these  washing  contrivances  in  Asia  are 
frequently  placed  out  of  doors  in  the  yard,  it  will  be 
understood  what  a  comfort  it  was  to  have  brought 
with  me  an  indiarubber  basin.  Some  travellers  had 
arrived  before  us — an  officer,  I  think,  and  his  wife — 
who  consequently  occupied  the  guest-chamber ;  and, 
there  being  no  room  for  us  in  the  inn,  the  post-mistress 
brought  the  samovar  outside  the  stable  and  spread 
for  us  a  table  in  the  wilderness.  All  around  was  a 
barren  steppe,  without  a  blade  of  vegetation  the  horses 
could  eat.  It  was  truly  pitiable  to  see  them  crawling 
around  us  almost  starved.  It  appeared  that  their 
usual  supply  of  corn  had  not  been  brought,  and  the 
poor  creatures  were  trying  to  pick  up  the  handfuls  of 
chaff  lying  about.  I  offered  one  of  them  a  piece  of 
white  bread,  but  he  would  not  eat  it,  and  I  began  to 
wonder  how  we  should  get  on.  It  was  needless  to 
ask  whether  the  post- master  had  horses.  There  were 
plenty  before  us,  but  they  were  reputed  to  be  sick, 
and  they  certainly  looked  so.  Nor  did  they  possess 
at  this  station  tar  enough  to  lubricate  the  wheels  of 
our  wagonette.  A  fine  place,  truly,  to  be  **  stuck 
fast  "  at  the  mercy  of  a  Cossack  post-master  till  his 
horses  could  be  fattened  for  work  !  But,  most  fortu- 
nately, the  news  of  our  coming  had  preceded  us,  and 
they  said  that  we  should  have  horses. 

And  so  we  did,  though  they  were  anything  but 
fier)^  steeds  to  pull  us  over  the  next  stage,  which  was 
the  worst  we  had  had,  the  road  lying  sometimes  on 
rocky  hillocks,  and  sometimes  over  sand,  in  which  the 


FROM  SERGIOPOL   TO  ALTYN-IMMEL,  177 

wheels  occasionally  stuck.  Driver  and  fares  accord- 
ingly descended,  and  walked,  which  gave  us  the 
opportunity  of  examining  the  tall  dry  assafoetida 
plants  by  the  side  of  the  track,  and  to  catch  a  few 
butterflies  and  dragonflies.  But  even  in  this  fashion 
our  sorry  horses  made  slow  work  of  it.  We  were, 
however,  passing  over  ground  of  geographical  interest, 
it  being  none  other  than  what  is  believed  to  have  been 
the  dry  bed  of  a  sheet  of  water,  connecting  what  are 
now  the  lakes  Balkhash  and  Ala-Kul. 

Only  50  miles  to  the  left  of  us  lay  the  once  little- 
known  Ala-Kul,  conjectured  by  Humboldt  to  be  the 
centre  of  the  subterranean  forces  of  Central  Asia, 
though  subsequently  shown  by  Schrenk,  its  first 
explorer,  to  have  no  traces  of  volcanic  rocks,  either 
on  the  islands  or  round  the  lake.*  This  region  has 
also  a  touch  of  historical  interest.  The  Franciscan 
monk,  Jean  de  Piano  Carpini,  sent  by  Pope  Innocent  IV. 
to  Mongolia  in  1245,  gives  no  clue  to  his  route  across 

♦  The  absolute  altitude  of  Ala-Kul  is  1,200  feet  (according  to 
Semenoff  780  feet),  and  the  appearance  of  the  locality  leads  to  the 
supposition  that  between  the  levels  of  the  Ala-Kul  and  Balkhash  there 
is  no  perceptible  difference.  On  early  Chinese  maps  the  Ala-Kul  is 
shown  as  one  lake,  and  not,  as  now,  divided  into  three.  According  to 
Kirghese  traditions  the  level  of  the  water  rises  and  falls.  They  say 
that  in  the  times  of  their  fathers  the  waters  of  the  lake  extended  over 
a  considerably  larger  area  than  at  present ;  that  afterw'ard  the  level 
began  to  subside,  and  a  quarter  of  a  century  ago  was  so  low  that 
small  islands,  now  250  yards  from  the  shore,  were  joined  thereto. 
Subsequently  the  water  began  to  rise,  and  continued  so  to  do  for  some 
years.  The  belt  of  desert  now  separating  the  Ala-Kul  and  the  Balkhash 
is  about  60  miles  in  extent,  and  consists  of  the  beds  of  former  lakes  and 
sand  waves.  The  soil  is  of  sand,  or  clay,  encrusted  with  salt.  When 
I  crossed  it  the  summer  sun  had  parched  everything,  but  Mr.  Delmar 
Morgan  speaks  of  tough  grass,  heaths,  and  scrub  wormwood  imparting 
to  the  surroundings  in  spring  a  tinge  of  green,  whilst  vast  sheets  of 
water  then  indicated  that  the  traveller  had  reached  the  lowest  part  of 
the  country.

the  Steppe  till  he  mentions  a  lake,  that  is  believed  to 
be  Ala-Kul,  with  islands  and  a  violent  wind.  It  seems 
also  to  have  been  visited  by  William  de  Rubruquis 
and  Tch'ang  Te,  both  travelling  hereabouts  within  tht; 
following  20  years. 

A  drive  of  20  miles  from  Djus  Agach,  the  latter 
portion  of  which  was  over  rising  rocky  ground,  brought 
us  to  Arganatinsk.      By  this  time  the  sun  was  at  its 


meridian,  and  the  thermometer  in  the  tarantass  rose 
to  85°.  The  post-house  stood,  according  to  my 
aneroid,  at  1,600  feet  above  the  sea,  and  on  either 
side  rose  two  bare  rocky  hills  covered  with  loose 
shingle,  up  one  of  which  I  had  determined  to  climb, 
to  have  the  satisfaction  of  getting  a  peep,  20  miles 
off,  at  the  famous  Lake  Balkhash. 

This  lake  was  called  by  the  Kalmuks  Balkatsi  Nor, 
Great    Lake,  and  by   the    Kii^hese    Ak-Dengkis,    or 


FROM  SERGIOPOL   TO  'ALTYN-IMMEL,  179 

White  Sea  ;  Ala  Denghis,  or  mottled  sea,  on  account 
of  its  islands  ;  or  simply  DeftghtSy  the  sea.  To  the 
Chinese  it  was  known  as  Sihai\  or  Eastern  Sea,  and 
it  is  in  their  records  that  the  earliest  information  about 
the  lake  is  to  be  found.  In  shape  Lake  Balkhash 
resembles  the  body  of  an  ant  without  the  legs,  the 
head  pointing  east.  Its  length  is  about  400  miles, 
its  width  varies  from  5  to  53  miles,  its  circumference 
is  9CX)  miles,  and  its  area  12,800  square  miles,  or 
about  36  times  larger  than  the  Lake  of  Geneva,  though 
M.  Reclus  estimates  the  volume  of  water  in  the 
Balkhash  to  be  only  two  and  a  half  times  as  much  as 
that  of  the  Swiss  lake,  the  greatest  depth  of  the  Bal- 
khash being  70  feet,  whilst  in  the  centre  and  southern 
portions  its  depth  is  only  35  feet,  and  in  certain  places 
on  the  southern  side  it  is  so  shallow,  and  the  shore  so 
shelving,  that  a  strong  wind  sometimes  lays  bare  for 
a  time  a  portion  of  its  bed.* 

Many  Kirghese  pass  the  winter  on  the  sandy  shore, 
the  surface  yielding  a  limited  pasturage  for  their  flocks. 
The  reeds,  16  feet  high,  shelter  them  from  the  north 

*  Through  the  northern  or  Semipolatinsk  shore  not  one  perennial 
stream  makes  its  way ;  even  the  large  stone,  the  Tokrau,  falling  short 
of  the  lake  in  drought,  absorbed  by  the  sands.  So  it  is  also  with 
such  wadys  on  the  south  as  have  their  sources  in  the  Steppe  ;  but  the 
majority  of  the  streams  coming  from  the  snow  mountains  reach  the 
lake,  carr^dng  down  such  quantities  of  earth  with  them  as  threaten  to 
divide  the  lake  into  separate  basins.  The  banks  on  the  north  and 
part  of  the  south-east  are  mountainous,  whereas  on  the  south  are  broad 
sand-hills,  and  in  many  places  the  change  from  land  to  water  is  so 
gradual  that  it  is  hard  to  say  where  one  ends  and  the  other  begins. 
The  rocky  promontories  on  the  north  side,  where  the  water  is  deepest, 
can  be  approached  only  when  the  lake  is  smooth,  whilst  the  low  reed- 
covered  peninsulas  on  the  south,  for  lack  of  water,  cannot  be  approached 
at  all.  The  bed  is  sandy,  except  where  the  shores  are  rocky,  and  then 
it  is  stony,  though  along  the  south-eastern  and  eastern  shores,  the  bottom 
is  of  ooze. 

The  surface  of  the  Balkhash  rises  from  mid- April  to  the  end  of  July,

wind,  providing  at  the  same  time  a  haunt  for  wild 
boars,  wolves,  and  tigers,  and  in  the  spring  a  breeding- 
place  for  myriads  of  wild  birds.  Little  rain  falls,  and 
the  summer  heat  is  unbearable.  Winds  blow  almost 
daily  over  the  lake,  but  not  steadily,  sometimes  raising 
very  high  waves.  There  is  abundance  of  fish  in 
its  waters,  especially  Marntk,  Usman,  and  Perch.  In 
summer  and  in  windy  weather  they  keep  to  the  shallows; 
but  in  winter  go  to  the  open  lake.  On  a  promontory 
on  the  north-west  coast,  a  harbour  was  constructed  in 
1850.  Though  navigable  throughout,  the  Balkhash 
can  be  continuously  navigated  only  in  vessels  with 
deep  keels.  The  harbour  was  intended  as  a  depot  for 
goods  to  be  despatched  to  the  trans- Hi  district,  but 
endeavours  to  carry  on  navigation  have  not  thus  far  met 
with  adequate  success.  There  are,  moreover,  no  places 
adjacent  to  the  edges  of  the  lake  that  are  fit  for 
settlements,  and  the  whole  district  seems  likely  to 
remain  a  wilderness. 

As  I  stood  at  Arganatinsk,  on  the  top  of  the  hill, 
whither  I  had  clambered  400  feet,  I  was  surrounded 
with   deserts   that,   with  clay  beds,   salt  steppes,   and 

during  the  melting  of  the  snows,  and  the  overflow  of  the  rivers  flooding 
the  surrounding  country  creates  pestiferous  swamps.  At  this  time  of 
year  the  water  near  the  mouth  of  the  Hi  is  almost  fresh,  while  at  the 
north-east  end  it  is  brackish  all  the  year  round,  though  usable  ;  and  at 
the  southern  extremity  the  water  is  so  salt  as  to  kill  animals  that  drink 
it.  Hence  there  it  is  called  by  the  Kirghese  It-ickmiz,  "  not  fit  for  a 
dog."  The  soil  around  Lake  Balkhash  is  principally  rock  and  sand. 
On  the  north  and  north-west  the  land  is  elevated,  barren,  waterless,  and 
therefore  a  complete  waste.  On  the  opposite  shores,  whence  the  lake 
is  fed  by  the  so-called  "seven  rivers,'*  rocks  occur  only  in  two  places, 
and  for  many  miles  along  its  margin  there  is  not  a  stone  to  be  found. 
This  sandy  region  stretches  from  the  lake  for  200  miles  to  the  foot  of 
the  Ala-Tau  mountains.  Across  this  vast  extent  there  grows  scrub 
forest,  fit  only  for  fuel,  called  by  the  natives  saksaul^jingil,  teresken, 
chiral,  jui,  tuzgen^  sul,  and  aktikken.  There  are  also  varieties  of 
grasses,  including  a  Hasp  and  kizilcha.

moving  sands,  seemed  to  show  that  the  Balkhash  had 
once  been  larger  than  at  present.  In  front  of  me,  as  I 
looked  towards  the  lake,  was  the  Uchakty  Kum,  and 
behind,  the  Niiaz-,  the  Sary-,  and  the  Tash-kara  Kum. 
Fortunately  our  road  crossed  directly  no  one  of  these, 
but  we  fell  in  that  night  with  one  of  their  local  pheno- 
mena. At  the  next  station  they  gave  us  four  sorry 
horses,  and,  what  was  worse,  a  sleepy  Kirghese  driver, 
whom  I  caught  several  times  nodding  on  the  box.  He 
understood  no  Russian,  so  I  more  than  once  conveyed 
to  him  my  meaning  by  a  thump  in  the  back,  where- 
upon he  looked  round  as  if  I  were  unfairly  disturbing 
his  slumbers.  At  last,  finding  it  useless  to  vex  my  im- 
petuous soul,  I  resigned  myself  to  fate  and  tried  to 
sleep,  for  night  had  well  set  in.  There  came  puffing 
into  the  carriage,  however,  a  dry,  hot  wind,  the  like  to 
which  I  had  never  experienced  before.  My  ordinary 
clothes  were  too  hot,  and  I  would  fain  have  lifted  the 
curtain  and  let  down  the  apron,  but  the  heavens  lowered, 
and  the  wind  so  stirred  up  the  sand  that  I  wondered 
what  manner  of  thing  was  going  to  happen.  I  have 
since  learned  that  frequent  sandstorms,  of  the  character 
of  snowdrifts,  but  far  more  dangerous,  occur  on  these 
steppes  about  the  Balkhash,  and  that  they  some- 
times rage  for  several  days.  Mr.  Delmar  Morgan 
speaks  of  the  **  Ehbi  '*  wind  that  blows  from  the  south- 
east towards  the  Ala-Kul,  and  is  sometimes  so  violent 
as  to  have  the  force  of  a  hurricane.  It  raises  clouds 
of  snow  and  sand,  and  has  been  known  to  bury  solitary 
travellers,  and,  it  is  said,  villages  also.  The  caravans 
bound  for  Kuldja  are  afraid  of  it,  and  either  wait  till 
it  is  over  in  the  plains,  or,  to  avoid  it,  go  by  way  of  the 
mountains. 

Whether   I  had  come  across  a  modified  specimen  of 


i82  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

the  ''  Ehbi  "  wind  I  know  not,  but  on  our  arrival  in  the 
early  morning  at  Lepsinsk,  we  saw  the  sand  blowing  in 
such  fashion  as  I  had  never  before  witnessed.  To  go 
only  from  the  carriage  into  the  post-house,  the  gritty 
element  dashed  most  disagreeably  into  the  face,  mouth, 
and  eyes,  and  covered  us  as  effectually  with  sand  as  if 
we  had  rolled  in  it.  This  was  bad  enough,  but,  to  make 
matters  a  little  worse,  our  luggage  wagonette  was 
nowhere  to  be  seen.  We  had  foolishly  allowed  the 
driver  to  follow  us  instead  of  insisting  that  he  should 
go  on  ahead,  and  now  we  were  to  pay  the  penalty.  I 
urged  that  our  man  should  go  back  to  see  if  the 
concern  had  broken  down,  and,  if  so,  give  the  driver 
help.  But  he  did  not  seem  to  consider  that  a  part  of 
his  duty.  After  waiting  some  time  we  declared  that 
we  would  make  complaint  of  the  delay,  and  at  last  by 
bribes  or  threats,  or  perhaps  both,  our  man  was  moved 
and  set  off  on  horseback. 

The  post-station  was  not  one  of  the  most  cheerful, 
for  it  lacked  the  presence  of  one  of  the  gentler  sex, 
and  the  household  affairs  of  our  bachelor  or  widower 
post-master  appeared  all  higgledy-piggledy.  I  sighted, 
however,  a  water-melon,  which  he  allowed  me  to  buy, 
and,  with  this  added  to  our  own  resources,  we  made  one 
if  not  two  meals  before  the  luggage  arrived.  Presently 
the  post-master  said  that  one  of  his  Kirghese  workmen, 
from  the  top  of  the  stable,  thought  he  could  see  some- 
thing moving  on  the  road  about  8  miles  off,  a  feat  I 
should  have  doubted  had  I  not  heard  of  the  keen  sight 
of  these  sons  of  the  desert.  At  last  our  man  arrived, 
and  explained  that  the  horses  in  the  wagonette  were 
so  attenuated  that  it  had  been  necessary  to  carry  corn 
to  bait  them  half-way,  and  that  the  driver,  having  put 
food  before  his  beasts,  had  gone  off  to  sleep,  and  was 


FROM  SERGIOPOL   TO  ALTYN-IMMEL,  183 

quietly  reposing  by  the  roadside.  On  being  aroused 
he  was  ashamed  to  face  us,  and  handed  over  his  charge 
to  our  driver,  so  that  all  we  could  do  to  the  delinquent 
was  to  call  down  vengeance  upon  him,  by  complaining, 
in  the  book  set  apart  for  that  purpose,  that  we  had  been 
delayed  on  this  stage  for  1 2  hours. 

I  had  heard  of  the  little  station  at  Lepsinsk  as  far 
west  as  Moscow,  and  was  requested  to  inquire  there 
for  a  letter  from  a  Russian  colonel,  a  friend  of  my 
adviser,  who,  he  said,  would,  if  at  home,  find  me 
Kirghese  antiquities,  or  open  one  of  the  Kalmuk 
tumuli  of  the  neighbourhood,  and  send  or  accompany 
me  from  the  town  of  Lepsinsk  over  the  Ala-Tau 
mountains  to  Lake  Sairam-Nor,  and  in  this  way  get 
me  to  Kuldja  instead  of  going  round  the  post-road. 
But  against  this  spirited  enterprise  I  was  strongly 
warned  before  entering  Asia,  and,  pressed  as  I  was  for 
time,  I  found  it  to  be  out  of  the  question.  Besides 
which,  there  was  no  letter  awaiting  me  at  the  station, 
so  I  hastened  to  get  forward. 

A  better  lot  of  post-horses  was  given  us  at  Lepsinsk, 
which  we  left  with  the  sandstorm  still  blowing,  and 
soon  came  to  the  River  Lepsa,  that  gives  its  name 
both  to  the  station  as  well  as  to  the  chief  town  of 
the  district.* 

♦  This  river  flows  out  of  a  spur  of  the  Sungarian  Ala-Tau,  and 
consists  of  two  channels,  which  converge  towards  the  Ichke-Ulmes 
mountains,  where  the  Lepsa  flows  through  steep  and  mountainous 
banks  over  a  rocky  soil.  From  its  source  to  the  post-station  the  stream 
is  very  swift,  and  bears  down  stones  and  trees.  Below  the  Lepsinsk 
station  it  becomes  quieter,  and  in  the  flood  season  is  navigable  to  its 
mouth  for  flat-bottomed  boats  carrying  16  tons.  The  outlet  of  the 
river,  however,  is  choked  with  weeds,  and  these  prevent  passage  into 
the  Balkhash.  The  length  of  the  river  is  about  zi^^i  nailes,  with  a  valley 
from  2  to  3  miles  wide,  in  which  are  many  hay-producing  areas,  but 
since  with  the  grass  spring  up  reeds  and  scrub,  haymaking  is  not 
always  profitable. 


i84  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

At  the  next  station,  Baskanskiy,  there  were  trees 
before  the  post-house,  and,  further  on,  herbage 
appeared  with  camels  feeding,  after  which  snow 
mountains  loomed  in  the  distance,  and  we  crossed  in 
a  small  ferry-boat  the  Ak-Su,  a  smaller  and  narrower 
river  than  the  Lepsa,  but  quite  as  rapid.  At  the 
Ak-Su  station  horses  were  again  given  us,  but  it 
must  not  be  supposed  that  all  this  came  as  a  matter 
of  course,  for  we  overtook  at  least  three  officers  in 
these  picket-stations,  against  whom  we  should  have 
had  no  chance  in  securing  horses,  but  for  the  kind 
patronage  of  the  Governor-General.  To  expedite 
matters  still  more,  and  finding  that  an  estaphet,  or 
mounted  messenger,  could  be  sent  on  ahead  for  such 
a  trifle  as  a  halfpenny  a  mile,  I  began  the  practice 
further  on  of  sending  off  immediately  on  my  arrival 
a  boy  to  the  next  station  to  announce  my  coming, 
so  that  if  the  horses  were  turned  out  on  the  steppe, 
they  might  be  brought  to  the  stable  ready  to  be 
harnessed  at  a  moment's  notice.  At  the  Ak  Su  station 
it  poured  with  rain — a  fact  I  mention  only  to  take  of 
those  refreshing  drops  farewell — a  long  farewell,  for 
days  and  weeks  and  months,  since,  if  I  remember 
rightly,  we  saw  no  more  like  them  for  upwards  of 
three  months — that  is,  till  we  reached  the  Caucasus  in 
December. 

At  Abakumovskiy,  the  next  station,  we  were  near 
the  mountains.  From  this  place  a  post-road  goes  off 
at  the  foot  of,  and  parallel  to,  the  Ala-Tau  range,  a 
distance  of  65  miles,  past  three  stations  to  Lepsinsk. 
The  first  station  is  Sarkandskiy,  to  which  I  have 
already  referred  as  peopled  chiefly  by  baptized  Taran- 
chis  ;  and  the  fourth,  Lepsinskaia,  Mr.  Morgan  says, 
lies  under  the  shadow  of  the  principal   range  of  the 


FROM  SERGIO  POL   TO  ALTYN-IMMEL.  185 

Ala-Tau,  in  an  amphitheatre  of  mountains  bearing 
the  local  name  of  "  Djeilau,"  or  summer  pasture 
grounds.  Although  at  an  elevation  of  3,500  feet, 
its  climate  is  temperate  and  healthy  at  all  seasons,  the 
rainfall  supplies  every  need  of  the  agriculturist,  and 
even  timber  is  not  wanting  in  the  higher  mountains, 
while  Alpine  scenery,  lakes  and  waterfalls,  not  to  men- 
tion a  rich  and  diversified  flora,  lend  additional  charms 
to  the  neighbourhood.  Lepsinsk  is  one  of  the 
districts  in  which  the  colonists  prosecute  the  keeping 
of  bees,  though  to  a  less  extent  than  in  the  uyezds 
north  and  south.* 

The  Sungarian,  **  Cis-Ili,"  or  *'  Northern"  Ala-Tau, 
so  called  in  contradistinction  to  the  *'  Southern  "  or 
**Trans-Ili"  Ala-Tau,  terminates  that  vast  depression 
stretching  to  the  south  of  the  Tarbagatai,  in  the 
midst  of  which  are  situated  the  lakes  I  have  been 
describing."!" 

*  I  have  no  recent  statistics,  but,  according  to  the  latest  to  hand, 
there  were  in  Sarkan  9  beekeepers,  and  throughout  the  Kopal  uyezd 
29.  In  the  Sergiopol  uyezd  there  were  103,  and  in  the  Vi^my  uyBzd 
188 ;  making  for  the  whole  of  Semirechia  320  beekeepers,  who, 
during  the  15  years  from  1 856-1 871,  collected  71  tons  of  honey,  and  10 
tons  of  wax,  of  which  amount  47  tons  of  honey  and  7J  tons  of  wax 
were  sold. 

t  The  main  range  of  the  system  corresponds  nearly  with  the  45th 
parallel  of  latitude,  and  here  are  snow-clad  peaks  for  a  distance  of 
more  than  130  miles,  with  but  a  very  limited  number  of  passes. 
Mr.  Morgan  calls  this  Ala-Tau  the  first  step  in  the  series  of  ascents 
to  the  highlands  of  Central  Asia,  approached  from  the  north,  and 
describes  its  appearance  in  the  distance  as  like  a  massive  rampart  with 
snowy  parapet  extending  to  the  west  as  far  as  the  eye  can  reach.  But 
on  closer  acquaintance  it  is  found  to  consist  of  several  nearly  parallel 
chains,  considerably  lower  than  the  main  range,  though  adding  much 
to  its  width.  The  average  height  of  the  range  reaches  6,000  feet,  but 
isolated  peaks  attain  to  12,000  and  more.  The  limit  of  perpetual  snow 
was  computed  by  Schrenk  to  be  10,700  feet.  The  outer  hills,  composed 
largely  of  Jurassic  formations,  are  cut  by  the  rivers  Lepsa,  Baskan, 
Sarkan,  and  Ak-Su,  which   issue   from  deep  and  almost  impassable 


i86  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

On  leaving  Abakumovskiy  we  found  ourselves 
ascending  a  mountain  path,  named  the  Hasfort  pass, 
after  a  former  Governor-General  of  Western  Siberia, 
that  called  to  my  mind  the  sides  of  one  of  the  Cali- 
fornian  canons,  and  it  was  not  till  far  on  in  the  night 
that  we  reached  the  station  Arasan,  where  I  was  too 
sleepy  to  see  much,  but  I  heard  that  the  station- 
master  was  a  Pole,  who,  understanding  that  I  was  a 
foreigner,  asked  whether  I  came  from  Paris.  What 
gaieties  I  should  have  seen,  had  it  been  daylight,  I 
know  not,  for  we  were  nov/  at  the  fashionable  bathing 
place  of  the  neighbourhood.  Here  are  hot  sulphur 
springs  (whence  the  name  Arasan) y  much  frequented 
in  summer.  There  are  bathing  houses,  a  pretty  garden, 
and  a  small  hotel.* 

From  Arasan  we  posted  into  a  temperature  uncom- 

gorges  into  the  plain  below.  From  the  summit  of  the  first  ascent  are 
to  be  heard  distinctly  the  roar  of  cataracts  in  the  higher  ice-bound 
granite  cliffs.  To  the  west  the  range  falls  almost  at  once  to  the 
picket-station  of  Ak-Ichke,  where  there  are  only  some  low  hills  that 
soon  mingle  with  the  plain.  To  the  east  a  like  phenomenon  occurs, 
forming  the  boundary  of  Kaptagai,  except  that  here  the  contrast  is 
more  striking.  Between  the  points  named  there  is  an  interval  of  200 
miles,  and  in  this  are  the  more  or  less  accessible  passes  of  Tentek  and 
Lepsa.  Besides  these  passes  connecting  Lepsa  with  the  south  should 
be  mentioned  two  caravan  routes  to  the  north  striking  the  main  post- 
road,  one  at  Arganatinsk,  and  the  other  slightly  north  of  Little  Ayaguz. 
Such  a  peculiarity  of  surface,  says  Colonel  Kostenko,  makes  an  ex- 
cellent state  boundary  for  Russian  Central  Asia,  and  the  abundant 
water  supply  on  the  plains  to  the  north  admits  of  the  possibility  of 
maintaining  on  the  limits  of  this  frontier  line  a  large  settled  population 
and  great  numbers  of  armed  men. 

*  Other  thermal  springs  are  found  east  of  Ala-Kul ;  also  in  the 
Borokhoro  range  are  hot  sulphur  baths,  with  a  temperature  of  122**,  as 
measured  by  Mr.  Morgan.  In  both  the  latter  localities  cold  springs 
occur  by  the  side  of  the  hot  ones.  In  the  Borokhoro  natural  baths, 
resorted  to  by  the  natives,  a  thin,  cold  stream  issues  from  the  rocks, 
and  has  been  so  adjusted  that  a  bather  may  have  a  jet  of  water  trickle 
on  his  eye.  This  has  been  devised  as  a  cure  for  ophthalmy,  a  prevalent 
complaint  in  this  region. 


FROM  SERGIOPOL   TO  ALTYN-IMMEL.  187 

fortably  cold,  till  sunrise  found  us  3,900  feet  above  the 
sea  at  Kopal.  This  town  was  formeriy  the  capital  of 
the  province,  and  has  a  population  of  5,000  souls.  It 
was  founded  in  1841,  and  is  finely  situated  in  a  valley. 
It  has  two  schools,  two  churches,  and  a  mosque,  but  is 
now  on  the  decline,  since  the  business  formerly  done  in 
the  Steppe  has  now  been  largely  transferred  to  the  new 
capital  at  Vierny.  As  we  drove  through  the  town 
before  its  inhabitants  were  astir,  it  looked  well-built 
and  clean.  I  would  gladly  have  purchased  some  new 
white  bread,  but  as  this  would  have  delayed  us  some 
hours,  and  necessity  did  not  compel  me  to  stop,  we 
posted  on  past  Ak-Ichke,  and  breakfasted  at  the  next 
station,  Sari-bulak,  beyond  which  the  way  lay  thrdVigh 
tall  herbage  with  hollyhocks.  Here  we  met  our  first 
camel  caravan  and  signs  of  increased  animal  life.  Thus 
far,  apart  from  the  stations,  we  had  not  seen,  I  think, 
all  the  way  since  leaving  Semipolatinsk  a  single  collec- 
tion of  houses  that  could  be  called  a  road-side  village. 
At  Vyselok-Karibulaksky  was  a  village,  and  something 
much  rarer,  a  church,  whilst  the  cultivated  land  around 
recalled  one  of  the  Siberian  villages,  so  closely  planted 
along  some  of  the  post- roads.  Here  I  observed,  flying 
about,  my  first  Hoopoe,  with  its  gay  yellow  crest  and 
speckled  wings.  Up  to  the  next  station,  Djangyz- 
Agachskiy,  the  road  had  made  a  considerable  ddtour 
to  the  west  in  order  to  skirt  some  spurs  of  the  Ala- 
Tau,  and  beyond  this  station  we  ascended  among 
barren  mountains  to  the  height  of  4,500  feet  above  the 
sea.  At  the  following  station,  Tsaritsin,  we  had  reached 
a  point  40  miles  in  a  straight  line  from  Kopal,  but 
which  had  cost  us  double  that  distance  to  attain  to. 
Here  was  a  telegraph  station,  the  officer  of  which  in 
his   loneliness  eagerly  asked  for   books.      From  this 


i88  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

point  the  road  divides,  one  branch  making  a  cUtour  to 
the  left  by  Kok-su  and  Ters-agan  to  Kugalin,  whilst 
the  road  to  the  right  goes  to  Kugalin  direct.  This 
latter  way  we  went,  starting  after  tea,  and  arriving  in 
the  middle  of  the  night  two  stations  further  on  at 
Altyn-Immel.  So  cold  had  it  become  during  the  last 
two  stages  that,  despite  my  Ulster  coat  and  Maude 
shawl,  I  had  to  descend  from  the  tarantass  and  run  to 
warm  my  feet. 

Altyn-Immel  to  us  was  "  Kuldja  junction,"  where  we 
had  to  re-arrange  if  not  to  "change  carriages."  From 
this  point  we  turned  off  to  Kuldja,  that  was  to  be  our 
next  resting-place,  whither  it  seemed  unnecessary  to 
dra^  our  wagonette,  laden  chiefly  with  Russian  books, 
but  rather  to  take  the  Mongolian  and  Chinese  Scrip- 
tures, and  leave  the  rest  till  our  return.  We  arrived 
in  the  small  hours  of  the  morning  at  Altyn-Immel, 
where,  being  unable  to  find  anyone  in  the  post-house, 
I  entered  the  guest-room,  and  began  writing  till  day- 
light should  bring  someone  on  the  scene.  At  length 
the  post-master,  a  Tatar,  emerged  from  his  sleeping- 
place,  that  was  none  other  than  an  empty  post-cart  in 
the  yard,  after  which,  our  boxes  left  in  his  charge,  we 
hurried  off  towards  Kuldja.

SOON  after  sunrise  on  the  last  day  of  August,  we 
left  the  post-station  with  our  stock  of  Chinese  and 
Mongolian  books  piled  on  the  tarantass  in  three  cases, 
and  thus  heavily  laden  we  gradually  ascended  for  seven 
miles  to  the  gorge  or  pass  of  Yakshi- Altyn-Immel,  or 
the  **  good  golden  saddle,"  so-callefd  in  distinction  from 
the  **  Yaman"  or  **bad  "  Altyn-Immel  pass  in  another 
part  of  the  range.  We  had  attained  a  height  of  about 
5,500  feet  above  the  sea,  and  had  a  fine  view  before 
us.  The  length  of  the  gorge  is  four  miles,  and  the 
road  passes  through  clefts  in  the  overhanging  rocks. 
At  times  the  cliffs  recede,  and  then  in  front  there  opens 
out  a  vast  plateau  shut  in  on  the  south  by  the  central 
course  of  the  Hi.  There  now  lay  before  us  a  district 
that  has  played  a  prominent  part  in  the  history  of  the 
East.  It  is  the  most  accessible  depression  by  which 
the  great  plateau  of  Central  Asia  may  be  reached  from 
the  Turkistan  plains.       Hence  the   Kuldja  oasis  has 


J  90 


RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 


served  as  a  resting-place  for  the  vast  hordes  whose 
migrations,  conquests,  and  defeats  have  formed  so 
important  a  chapter  in  the  history  of  Asia. 

The  Hi  valley  is  a  continuation  of  the  Semirechia 
country  running  east  in  the  shape  of  a  wedge  between 
the  Ala-Tau  and  Thian  Shan  mountains,  the  base  of 
the  triangle  being  open  to  the  Steppe  whilst  the  apex, 
where  the  Hi  has  its  sources,  is  closed  by  lofty  moun- 
tains. The  eastern  portion  of  the  valley,  which, 
together  with  the  Baratol  valley,  constituted  at  first 
under,  the  Russians  the  Kuldja  rayon,  or  province, 
occupies  an  area  of  25,000  square  miles,  or  half  the 
size  of  England,  and  is  bisected  by  the  River  Hi, 
formed  by  the  Kungess,  Tekess,  and  Kash,  and 
having  a  course  of  not  less  than  750  miles.  The 
mountain  range,  known  as  the  Borokhoro,  on  the 
north  of  the  valley,  does  not  exceed  9,000  or  10,000 
feet  in  height,  but  the  southern  range  rises  to  an 
absolute  altitude  of  15,000  feet,  covered  with  a 
dazzling,  continuous  mantle  of  snow,  the  skyline  being 
broken  by  an. endless  succession  of  giant  peaks,  some 
of  them  upwards  of  20,000  feet  above  the  level  of  the 
sea.  We  had  a  very  fine  view  of  distant  snow  peaks, 
and  of  bare  rocky  mountains  near  at  hand,  before  we 
descended  by  a  rapid  and  almost  dangerous  slope  into 
a  stony,  level,  and  arid  plain. 

On  reaching  the  first  station,*   Bash-chi,    we   had

come  down  more  than  2,ocK)  feet,  and  found  a  poor 
picket  station,  where  we  were  told  that  the  horses 
were  **  in  the  field,"  or,  better  said,  in  the  wilderness, 
and  the  time  it  took  to  catch  them  made  us  resolve 
to  send  forward  an  estaphet  to  announce  our  coming, 
and  so,  in  future,  prevent  delay.  By  tea  time  we  had 
reached  Konur-Ulen,  and  met  in  the  station  an 
invalid  telegraphist,  who  had  just  arrived  to  live  a 
month  in  a  Kirghese  tent  and  undergo  the  Kumiss 
cure.  He  had  brought  with  him  of  the  fruits  of  the 
land,  and  gave  us  a  melon,  which  added  a  relish  to  our 
meal,  coming,  as  we  did,  from  the  fruitless  steppe.  Tea 
over,  we  watched  a  Kirghese  woman  putting  up  his  tent, 
the  hire  of  which  for  a  month  was  to  cost  1 2^.  ;  and 
whilst  we  were  thus  employed,  the  post-master,  entering 
the  name  from  my  podorojna  in  his  book,  read  the  words, 
**  The  English  Pastor,  Henry  Lansdell,  Doctor  dogos- 
lovie' — literally,  doctor  of  the  Word  of  God  or  Divinity. 
The  **bogoslovie"  probably  puzzled  the  post-master, 
for  he  was  a  Tatar ;  but,  thinking  that  **  doctor"  had 
something  to  do  with  medicine,  he  came  to  show  his 
tongue,  covered  with  sores,  and  affected,  Mr.  Sevier 
feared,  with  cancer.  My  companion  applied  some 
caustic,  and  promised  to  see  him  again  on  our  return. 
The  man  bought  a  Kirghese  New  Testament,  and  we 
departed  over  at  first  a  fair  road,  though  afterwards 
it  proved  atrociously  stony.  On  arriving  at  Koibyn 
we  found  that  we  had  sent  forward  an  estaphet  to 
some  purpose,  for  Mr.  Sevier,  on  springing  out  of  the 
carriage  and  asking  for  horses,  was  told  that  he  could 
not  have  them,  for  they  were  being  kept  for  a  general 
— the  **  general"  proving  to  be  none  other  than  my 
humble  self,  whom  the  post-master  seemed  to  anticipate 
to  be  of  exalted  rank,  since  such  kind  attention  was 


192  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

being  shown  me  by  the  authorities.  From  Koibyn 
we  proceeded  up  a  mountain  gorge  that  is  described 
as  pretty  by  both  Schuyler  and  Ujfalvy,  who  speak  of 
the  varying  yellow,  red,  and  purple  hues  of  the  steep 
and  scarped  rocks,  as  also  of  bushes  covered  with 
blue,  white,  red,  and  yellow  flowers;  but  we  passed 
this  place  in  the  night,  and  by  dawn  came  within 
sight  of  Vyselok  Borokhudzir. 

In  passing  the  60  miles  from  Altyn-Immel  to  Koibyn, 
we  had  met  more  than  one  party  of  nomads  flitting 
to  new  pastures.  A  prominent  individual  among  -the 
first  cavalcade  was  a  stout  old  lady  riding  astride  a 
fat  ox.  Other  females  of  the  party  were  all  riding  in 
the  same  fashion,  some  on  camels,  with  children  in 
front,  and  some  on  saddled  oxen.*  We  saw  in  the 
distance  as  we  drove  along  Kirghese  auls,  with  their 
flocks  and  herds,  which  form  their  chief  means  of 
subsistence,  though  some  of  the  Kuldja  nomads  do, 
to  a  certain  extent,  cultivate  the  soil.f 

We  had  reached  Borokhudzir,  3,900  feet  above  the 
sea,  prettily  situated  on  the  right  bank  of  the  river  of 

*  I  was  subsequently  favoured  with  a  MS.  copy  of  the  latest  statistics 
(for  1878)  of  the  numbers,  grades,  domestic  economy,  and  places  of 
resort  of  the  nomad  population  of  Kuldja  ;  from  which  it  appears  that 
in  the  five  voUosts  of  the  northern,  and  five  of  the  southern,  divisions  of 
the  province  there  were  13,000  tents,  with  a  population  of  31,600  males, 
and  26,400  females.  Of  these,  36,000  were  Kirghese,  and  the  remainder 
Tatars,  Kalmuks,  etc.  So  far  as  there  are  any  grades  among  the  nomads, 
one  may  distinguish  in  the  province  14  sultan  or  aristocratic  families, 
4,000  igintchas,  or  poor,  and  1,000  mullahs. 

t  In  1878  they  sowed  of  wheat,  barley,  and  millet,  819  tons  ;  and 
reaped  21,925  tons,  or  a  twenty- seven -fold  harvest.  To  this  may  be 
added  the  wheat,  barley,  rice,  millet,  and  clover  of  the  settled  inhabi- 
tants of  the  province,  sown  to  the  amount  of  5,980  tons,  with  a  result  of 
107,632  tons  reaped,  or  nearly  a  twenty-fold  increase.  Kostenko  states 
that,  about  Kuldja,  crops  of  wheat  return  30  per  cent.  The  cattle  of  the 
nomads  numbered  750,000  (of  which  107,000  are  reported  to  have  died 
during  the  year)  and  the  cattle  of  the  settled  inhabitants  182,000.

that  name,  on  September  i  st,  and  had  I  been  a  devotee 
of  *'  Saint  Partridge"  there  would  have  been  no  need  for 
me  to  long  for  the  turnip  fields  of  Old  England  wherein 
to  keep  the  festival,  for  the  surrounding  woods  were 
full  of  game,  including  not  only  Partridges,  but  Phea- 
sants, greyish  Hares,  and  abundance  of  Deer.  For  some 
years  previous  to  the  Russian  occupation  of  Kuldja, 
Borokhudzir  was  the  Russian  outpost  in  this  direction, 
and  during  the  Dungan  insurrection  a  corps  was  sta- 
tioned here  to  prevent  infringements  of  the  Russian 
boundary.  Here,  too,  were  stored  up,  after  the  seizure 
of  Kuldja,  the  arms  taken  from  the  Dungans  and 
Taranchis.  After  the  annexation  of  Kuldja,  the  force 
stationed  here  (in  1877)  consisted  of  100  men  and 
2  guns  ;  but  at  the  time  of  my  visit  I  am  under 
the  impression  there  were  more,  in  prospect  of  Kuldja 
being  ceded  to  the  Chinese,  and  Borokhudzir  becoming 
again  the  frontier  fort — the  **  fortress"  meaning,  if 
I  mistake  not,  a  defensible  barrack  of  four  long 
buildings,  in  the  form  of  a  square,  and  not  a  defence 
with  ramparts. 

Peasant  colonists  from  the  Tomsk  province  of  Siberia 
have  built  a  settlement  near  of  about  50  whitewashed 
houses  of  unbaked  bricks,  where  is  a  post  and  telegraph 
office,  and  a  nursery  garden,  planted  in  1 869,  for  the 
purpose  of  showing  the  natives  how  to  develop  the 
vegetal  capabilities  of  the  country.  General  Kolpa- 
kovsky,  we  heard,  took  great  interest  in  this  experiment, 
and  on  our  return  journey  we  inspected  the  nursery. 
It  was  watered  by  irrigation,  and  in  the  season  furnished 
occupation  for  from  30  to  50  men.  The  vines  were 
trained  in  bowers,  of  which  there  were  many  and  long, 
but  the  cheapness  of  fruit  may  be  gathered  from  the 
fact  that   a  Sart  paid  only    £\%  for  all   the  season's

grapes.  The  number  and  variety  of  young  trees  and 
shrubs  was  very  considerable,  and  included  pears,  apples, 
walnuts,  peaches,  and  sundry  other  fruit-trees,  besides 
large  numbers  of  karagatch.  The  hard  timber  of  this 
last,  when  well  seasoned,  possesses  enduring  qualities 
that  are  highly  esteemed.  Some  of  it  also  was  growing 
in  the  form  of  well-cut  hedges.  Other  trees  were  the 
thorny  acacia,  and  among  poplars  a  silver  species  with 
a  light-green  smooth  bark.  I  noticed,  too,  raspberry 
canes,  artichokes,  cabbages,  cauliflowers,  cucumbers 
four  spans  long,  and  a  plant  resembling  a  large  turnip 
with  cabbage-leaves  coming  out  of  the  bulb.  The 
products  of  this  nursery  are  highly  esteemed  by  the 
natives,  and  are  distributed  as  far  as  Kopal. 

Besides  this,  I  should  mention  that  cotton  has  been 
successfully  grown  in  the  valley  of  the  Borokhudzir 
river.  It  was  introduced  in  1867  by  Chinese  emigrants, 
who  considered  the  clayey  soil  of  the  valley,  and  the 
long,  dry,  hot  summer,  with  a  short  snowless  winter, 
as  fairly  good  for  cotton  culture.*  In  the  years  1868-9 
an  attempt  was  made  at  growing  cotton  at  Borokhudzir 

*  The  soil  is  prepared  as  for  sowing  com,  the  ploughed  land  being 
formed  into  regular  beds,  not  more  than  seven  feet  square,  and  sur- 
rounded by  small  clay  dykes  to  preserve  the  seed  from  the  dampness  of 
the  canals.  The  beds  are  then  inundated  from  the  aryks,  and  remain  so 
for  about  three  days.  When  the  surface  is  quite  dry,  little  furrows  are 
made  in  the  beds  with  the  finger ;  into  these  the  seed  is  dropped  and 
lightly  covered  with  earth.  Two  weeks  after  sowing,  the  plants  come 
up,  and,  if  not  frostbitten,  the  stems  grow  rapidly  to  the  height  of  two 
feet.  A  rainy  summer  or  immoderate  watering  spoils  the  cotton,  but  in 
the  middle  of  August  germinal  pods  appear,  and  subsequently  increase 
to  the  size  of  a  walnut.  The  shell  hardens,  and  at  the  beginning  of 
October  bursts,  when  through  the  fissures  may  be  seen  the  white  fibres 
of  cotton  ;  this  at  length  hangs  out  of  the  pod,  and  is  then  ready  to  be 
gathered.  Cotton  culture  in  weeding  time  and  harvest  requires  despatch, 
and,  consequently,  the  employment  of  many  hands.  The  cotton  is 
freed  from  the  pods  and  seeds  by  the  clumsiest  of  contrivances,  such 
as  tax  the  patience  even  of  a  Chinaman  ;  and  the  preparation  of  thread,

by  the  Russian  soldiers,  under  Chinese  superinten- 
dence, but  the  climatic  conditions  of  those  seasons 
happened  to  be  unfavourable,  and  I  did  not  hear  that 
the  cultivation  was  being  carried  on  to  any  considerable 
extent  at  the  time  of  my  visit. 

From  Borokhudzir  we  drove  out  by  the  wide  street, 
fringed  with  canals  and  willows,  very  early  in  the 
morning;  and,  having  crossed  the  river  that  gives  its 
name  to  the  village,  we  traversed  a  vastly  improved 
region,  where  on  either  hand  there  met  us  tokens  of 
culture,  in  the  form  of  well-arranged  canals,  but  all  in 
ruins,  and  the  land  overgrown  with  weeds.  The  road 
entered  the  remains  of  a  considerable  forest  of  prickly 
shrubs,  pines,  willows,  and  karagatch  trees,  said  to 
have  extended  in  former  times  as  a  cultivated  forest 
nearly  all  the  way  to  Kuldja.  Chinese  settlements 
were  scattered  throughout,  and  the  ruins  of  them  are 
still  visible,  but  the  trees,  no  longer  cared  for  or  irri- 
gated, are  fast  dying.  Nine  miles  from  Borokhudzir 
we  crossed  the  River  Usek,  on  whose  bank  i^jar)  are 
situated  the  ruins  of  Jarkend. 

and  weaving  it,  is  carried  on  by  machines  equally  primitive.  Compar- 
ing the  lengths  of  three  kinds  of  cotton  grown  in  the  Borokhudzir 
valley,  it  was  found  that  the  "Tashkend"  measured 3^  inches;  the 
"American"  upwards  of  7  inches;  but  that  Chinese  cotton  of  the 
"Tashkend"  sort  was  shorter.  The  Chinese  cultivate  cotton  as  an 
accessory  to  com  growing,  but  seek  to  produce  only  so  much  as  will 
supply  the  family  with  clothing,  and  not  for  export  like  tea.  This 
remark,  however,  would  not  apply  to  the  natives  of  Samarkand,  where 
cotton  is  grown  under  more  favourable  conditions.  In  a  paper  trans- 
mitted to  the  American  Geographical  Society  of  New  York  in  1875  by 
M.  Brodowsky,  on  the  Cotton  of  Central  Asia,  the  author  states  that,  in 
1868,  Russia  manufactured  ;f  12,167,400  worth  of  cotton;  that  she  con- 
sumes yearly  48,000  tons  of  raw  cotton,  and  more  than  j^450,ooo  worth 
of  English  yam ;  that  of  this  quantity  9,600  tons  (or  one-fifth  of  the 
whole)  come  from  Central  Asia,  and  3,200  tons  from  Persia.  The  rest 
is  bought  in  Liverpool,  2,000  tons  being  of  American,  and  16,000  tons 
of  East  Indian  growth.

The  remnant  of  a  people  called  Solons  live  near. 
They  are  not  an  old  race  in  Sungaria,  but  are  "a  section 
of  the  Manchu  race  living  in  North-Western  Manchuria, 
and  forming  some  of  the  most  warlike  of  the  banner- 
men.  They  were  planted  largely  by  the  Manchus  in 
Sungaria,  when  they  conquered  it.  Mr.  Howorth 
met  one,  he  tells  me,  at  Petersburg,  at  an  Oriental 
Congress.  At  Jarkend  they  live  in  scattered  mud 
houses  in  winter,  and  in  summer  pitch  their  tents  on 
the  river  banks ;  but  they  are  few  in  number,  some 
having  removed  to  the  neighbourhood  of  Chuguchak, 
and  others  having  become  Christians,  and  settled  at 
Sarkansk.  The  place,  however,  is  likely  to  regain 
importance  from  the  Taranchi  and  Dungan  emigrants, 
who  have  settled  there  since  my  visit  in  order  to  be 
under  Russian  government,  in  preference  to  staying  in 
Kuldja  under  the  Chinese.  In  the  Usek  our  carriage 
stuck  fast  for  about  an  hour,  till  some  Cossacks  came 
to  the  rescue  and  got  us  out. 

By  breakfast  time  we  reached  Ak-Kend,  where  a 
comfortable  Chinese  house  had  been  converted  into 
a  Russian  post-station.  Here  we  met  a  travelling 
Russian  priest,  to  whom  I  sold  some  tracts  and  Scrip- 
tures. The  station  is  in  the  midst  of  a  once  flourishing, 
but  now  ruined,  Chinese  town,  the  one  semblance  of 
commerce  that  we  could  discern  being  two  or  three 
stalls  for  the  sale  of  melons  and  vegetables.  We 
speedily  purchased  some  of  the  former,  and  proceeded 
on  our  way,  now  meeting  clumsy  Chinese  carts,  and 
passing  here  and  there  a  field  under  cultivation.  On 
reaching  the  River  Khorgos,  which  is  the  boundary  line 
of  the  Russian  and  Chinese  empires,  we  found  en- 
camped a  number  of  Cossacks,  who  bought  some  of 
my  books,  and  then  proceeded  to  help  us  to  cross  the 


FROM  ALTYN'lMMEL   TO  KULDJA.  197 

Stream.  In  spring  this  is  sometimes  impossible  for 
weeks.  On  the  present  occasion  a  mounted  Cossack 
preceded  us  to  find  the  shallow  parts  of  the  bed, 
whilst  another  rode  by  the  side  of  the  tarantass,  with 
a  rope  attached,  to  keep  us  from  toppling  over.  On 
emerging  safely  from  the  river,  we  passed  ere  long  the 
walls  of  Tchimpantzi,  once  a  flourishing  industrial  and 
commercial  centre  with  50,000  inhabitants,  but  where 
not  a  single  house  had  been  left  standing.  Formerly 
the  town  was  surrounded  with  irrigated  fields,  but 
since  they  had  been  visited  with  the  curse  of  civil  war 
the  land  had  reverted  to  a  barren  steppe. 

Over  this  Steppe  we  drove  for  some  miles,  passing 
the  Taranchi  village  of  Mazar,  lying  off  to  the  left, 
whilst  three  miles  further  could  be  seen  the  Solon 
village  of  Dabir.  On  arriving  at  Alimptu  there  were 
no  post-horses,  though  the  chief  strove  to  comfort  us 
by  saying  that,  had  our  estaphet  only  arrived  earlier,  he 
would  have  stopped  the  post  in  order  that  we  might 
have  the  steeds.  Whether  this  was  perfectly  genuine 
I  know  not,  but  there  were  abundance  of  Cossack 
horses  in  the  stable ;  and  when  we  asked  the  Cossacks 
whether  they  could  not  take  us  forward,  they  graciously 
consented,  but  asked  for  four  times  the  normal  fare! 
This  they  abated,  Russian  like,  to  a  triple  charge, 
which  we  paid  rather  than  wait  longer  than  sufficed 
for  a  meal.  In  the  station  yard  was  a  stone  lion  with 
curly  mane,  similar  to  those  placed  by  the  Chinese  at 
the  doors  of  their  temples,  or  of  persons  of  high  rank, 
the  lion  being  usually  represented  in  a  sitting  posture 
with  the  right  paw  on  a  globe.  This  post-house  was 
kept  by  a  brother  and  good-looking  sister,  who  struck 
me  as  superior  to  the  average  of  their  class,  and  who 
were,  we  afterwards  found,  children  of  the  post-master

in   easy   circumstances   at  Chinchakhodzi,   where   we 
arrived  the  same  afternoon. 

All  the  morning,  as  we  had  driven  along  through 
ruined  towns  and  desolate  fields,  we  enjoyed  by 
contrast  a  strangely  beautiful  view  of  the  distant 
mountains,  their  bases  being  hidden  by  mist,  whilst 
their  snowy  peaks  seemed  to  float  on  the  bosom  of 
the  clouds.  This  was  especially  the  case  with  those 
on  the  right,  and  those  on  the  left  at  their  summits 
were  also  sprinkled  with  snow.  These  mountains  of 
the  Hi  valley  contain  numerous  minerals,  but  it  is 
doubtful  whether  any,  except  perhaps  coal,  are  valuable. 
Gold  is  found  only  in  the  right  affluents  of  the  Hi, 
which  spring  from  the  syenitic-granite  spurs  of  the 
Borokhoro  range.  When  the  Russians  took  possession 
of  Kuldja  they  instituted  an  inquiry  into  the  mining 
operations  of  the  natives,  and  found  things  in  a 
condition  truly  primitive. 

Coal  has  been  worked  in  the  valley  for  more  than 
half  a  century,  though  not  used  in  other  parts  of 
Central  Asia.  Chinese  labourers  worked  in  companies 
of  8  on  co-operative  principles,  or  Kalmuks  in  gangs 
of  12,  hired  by  Dungan  or  Taranchi  capitalists.  They 
sought  a  spot,  when  possible,  where  they  could  sink 
a  vertical  shaft  sometimes  300  feet  deep,  and  at  the 
same  time  advance  thereto  by  an  inclined  one,  the 
former  serving  to  raise  the  coal,  and  the  other  as  a 
means  of  communication.  Up  to  the  coming  of  the 
Russians  the  price  of  coal  at  the  pit's  mouth  was  %d, 
per  cwt,  by  reason  of  the  cheapness  of  labour,  materials, 
and  food.* 

*  One  coalmaster  stated  that  the  sinking  a  vertical  shaft  300  feet, 
and  making  an  inclined  adit  400  feet  long,  cost  him  about  ;^8o ;  the 
labour  employed  being  12  Kalmuks  during  the  winters  of  2^  years  at 
wages  of  **  a  penny  a  day,*'  or  24^.  each  per  annum,  and  food,  costing

The  Station  at  Chinchakhodzi  we  found  in  the  midst 
of  an  excellent  garden,  with  numbers  of  standard  peach 
trees,  and  a  bower  of  vines  with  grapes  beginning  to 
turn  colour.  Here  was  another  fair  sister  and  daughter 
of  Russia,  whose  mother,  the  post-mistress,  told  us  that 
it  was  her  son  and  daughter  whom  we  had  seen  at  the 
previous  station,  and  she  further  informed  her  guests, 
with  some  satisfaction,  that  she  had  another  son  a 
post-master,  and  a  third  who  held  the  appointment  of 
Russian  and  Chinese  interpreter  to  General  Friede, 
Governor  of  Kuldja.  But  though  the  happy  mother 
of  five  thriving  sons  and  daughters,  the  good  woman 

half  this  sum.  For  extracting  coal  he  hired  20  labourers  on  the 
same  terms,  who  raised  about  8  tons  a  day,  procuring  1,300  tons  in  160 
working  days.  Deducting,  in  addition,  cost  of  mining  apparatus,  and 
one-third  of  the  produce  for  tax  to  the  Khan,  selling  the  remainder  at 
\d,  per  cwt.  brought  the  coalmaster  about  10  per  cent,  upon  the 
capital  laid  out.  The  miners'  wages  in  Kuldja  would  not  delight  the 
heart  of  a  Northumbrian,  for  they  are  often  paid  in  the  form  of  old 
clothes ;  and  if  the  results  of  their  work  supply  the  miners  with  the 
barest  necessities,  they  are  content.  The  approximate  annual  output 
of  coal  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Kuldja,  previous  to  1873,  was  from 
10,000  to  13,000  tons. 

The  iron  mines  were  worked  also  by  means  of  vertical  and  inclined 
shafts,  and  sometimes  galleries  were  constructed  in  the  deepest  parts 
for  seeking  lodes  of  ore.  The  ore  was  roasted  and  then  smelted  in 
furnaces  made  of  bricks — air  being  introduced  by  hand-bellows.  For 
the  preparation  of  i  cw^t.  of  iron  were  required  7  cwt.  of  ore,  and  15 
cwt.  of  coal ;  the  cwt  costing  in  production  2S,  ^. ,  and  selling  at 
Kuldja,  in  1873,  for  4^.  lod.  The  quality  of  iron  was  of  the  worst,  and 
the  industry  generally  at  a  very  low  ebb.  Silver  mining  would  not 
appear  to  have  been  much  better,  for  Mr.  DavidofF  reported  that  a 
band  of  4  Chinamen  extracted  in  3  years  6  yambs  of  silver,  thereby 
earning  for  themselves  only  ^^3  each.  Copper  mining  under  the  natives 
was  still  less  satisfactory.  From  a  cwt.  of  ore  were  received  5  lbs. 
to  8  lbs.  of  black  copper,  afterwards  smelted  in  crucibles  and  cast. 
The  Taranchi  sultan,  when  in  power,  was  wont  to  order  a  levy  of  100 
Kalmuks  or  Chinese,  make  them  light  fires,  extract  the  ore,  and 
conduct  the  smelting,  for  which  they  received  their  food,  but  rarely 
any  wages.  In  1873  copper  smelting  had  been  going  on  2  or  3  years, 
and  the  production  for  that  period  was  said  to  have  been  about  3  tons.

had  a  **  skeleton  in  her  cupboard,"  even  in  the  Hi 
valley,  for  she  had  also  a  child  idiotic,  and,  reading 
**  Doctor"  on  my  podorojna,  she  supposed  there  might 
be  a  physician  passing  by,  and  brought  her  boy  of 
eight,  saying  that  he  had  never  spoken  since  he  was 
three  years  old,  that  he  had  fits,  was  never  still,  and 
seemed  like  one  possessed.  Sevier,  for  some  reason, 
could  not  dispense  for  her  satisfactorily  out  of  our 
medicine  chest,  but  promised  to  bring  on  our  return 
some  iodide  of  potassium,  and  gave  hope  to  the  mother 
that  her  child  might  outgrow  his  malady. 

Chinchakhodzi  is  inhabited  by  Dungans,  and,  being 
a  Mussulman  town,  escaped  the  general  destruction  at 
the  time  of  the  war.  It  is  surrounded  by  a  wall,  and 
wears  an  aspect  unmistakably  Chinese,  as  did  the 
maize  and  harvest  fields  we  next  passed  through. 
From  Chinchakhodzi  there  branches  off  a  road  by 
which  the  traveller,  after  a  journey  of  about  30  miles 
into  the  Borokhoro  range,  reaches  Lake  Sairam,  6,000 
feet  high,  and  about  300  square  miles  in  area,  above 
the  southern  shore  of  which  is  situated  the  Talki  pass. 
The  road  in  some  places  passes  over  steep  declivities, 
and  in  others  upon  cornices  hanging  over  precipitous 
cliffs,  whilst  here  and  there  are  preserved  the  ruins  of 
Chinese  pickets  or  military  posts.  At  the  bottom  of 
the  gorge  whirls,  amidst  roar  and  foam,  the  Talki 
stream,  and,  in  ascending,  the  appearance  of  the  grey 
and  red  piles  of  rock  becomes  wilder  and  grander.  As 
one  mounts  higher,  the  vegetation  peculiar  to  a  warm 
climate,  such  as  apricot,  dwarf  elm,  and  apple,  is 
replaced  by  the  hawthorn,  mountain  ash,  and  willow ; 
higher  comes  the  birch,  and,  higher  still,  a  wide  belt  of 
red  fir,  beyond  which  the  road  ascends  a  bare  rocky 
slope,  and,  when  the  crest  is  reached,  there  is  presented

to  the  view  a  majestic  and  peaceful  lake,  held  in  its 
mountain  basin  as  water  is  held  in  a  cup,  or  like  a  sheet 
of  clear  glass  softly  reflecting  the  azure  blue  of  the 
heaven  above.  Skirting  this  lake  is  the  great  Chinese 
**  Imperial  Road,"  connecting  Kuldja,  Urumchi,  and 
Pekin,  by  which  some  of  the  mediaeval  travellers  made 
their  way  now  to  the  Court  of  the  Mongols,  or  further 
to  the  land  of  Cathay.* 

Our  next  station  to  Chinchakhodzi  was  Suidun.  As 
we  approached  we  saw  the  Cossacks  exercising,  and 
coming  nearer  found  the  Chinese  strengthening  the 
walls  of  the  town.  About  10  miles  distant  were  the 
ruins  of  what  was  the  Chinese  capital,  variously  called 
Hi,  New  Kuldja,  and  Manchu  Kuldja,  in  which  75,000 
people  were  butchered  in  one  day.  We  did  not  go 
there,  nor  had  we  yet  seen  the  last  of  the  ruins  by 
the  roadside,  concerning  the  origin  of  which  I  have  as 
yet  said  nothing  in  detail,  though  I  think  an  outline 
thereof  will  better  enable  the  reader  to  understand  the 
heterogeneous  elements  of  which  the  Hi  population  is 
now  composed. 

The  history  of  the  Hi  valley  dates  back  as  far  as  the 
second  century  before  the  Christian  era,  when  the  Usuim 
were  driven  by  the  Huns  to  settle  there  from  Mongolia. 

*  Concerning  the  roads  of  this  region  the  principal  artery  is  the  great 
Chinese  carriage  road  leading  from  Nanking  by  way  of  Hankow, 
Ngan-si-chow,  and  Hami  to  Turfan.  Here  it  divides  north  and  south 
of  the  Hi  province,  one  branch  proceeding  through  Urumtsi,  Manass, 
and  Chuguchak  to  Semipolatinsk  (with  the  branch  described  above, 
over  the  Talki  pass  to  Kuldja),  and  the  other  passing  by  way  of 
Karashaar,  Korla,  Kucha,  and  Ak-Su  to  Kashgar.  There  are  also 
two  bridle  passes  from  Kuldja  to  the  carriage  roads  north  and  south 
of  the  mountains,  one  by  the  River  Kungess  to  the  Yuldus  plateau,  and 
the  other  by  the  Tekess  river  to  the  Muzart  Pass  near  Khan  Tengri  ; 
but  that  over  the  Talki  only  is  constructed  for  wheel  traffic,  and  even 
this  one  in  1873  was  in  so  ruined  a  condition  that  Mr.  Dilke  spoke  of  it 
as  not  passable  for  artillery. 


202  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Here  the  Usuim  became  a  powerful  people,  till  in  the 
fourth  century  they  again  migrated,  and  their  place 
was  occupied  by  the  Uighurs,  a  Turkish  tribe  that  had 
descended  from  the  north  and  occupied  the  slopes  of 
the  Eastern  Thian  Shan.  China,  however,  had  long 
before  made  her  power  felt  over  Central  Asia.  Chau- 
tsian,  in  the  second  century  b.c,  journeyed  from  China 
and  commenced  relations  with  "the  Western  Country." 
Annexations  followed,  and  in  b.c.  59  the  country  north 
and  south  of  the  Thian  Shan  acknowledged  the 
suzerainty  of  the  Celestials.  This  sway  was  only 
nominal  for  some  hundreds  of  years,  but  in  627  the 
second  emperor  of  the;  Tang  dynasty  despatched  an 
army  to  strengthen  the  wavering  allegiance  of  the 
Uighurs,  whereupon  the  western  country  was  divided 
into  departments,  and  placed  under  a  viceroy.  Later 
on  the  Chinese  power  in  Central  Asia  declined,  and 
the  **  Western  Country "  fell  in  succession  under  the 
Tibetan  tribes,  the  Arabs,  and  the  Kara-Khitai,  and 
then  under  Jinghiz  Khan. 

After  the  time  of  Jinghiz  Khan,  Sungaria,  of  which 
the  Hi  valley  was  a  part,  was  possessed  by  several 
tribes,  called  Kalmuks,  who  formed  a  confederacy,  and 
were  termed  Oirats,  Their  influence  spread  over  all 
Mongolia,  and  in  1450  they  conquered  the  Chinese,  but 
subsequently  their  power  declined.  In  the  beginning 
of  the  seventeenth  century  internal  dissensions  began 
to  lead  to  secessions  of  tribes,  and  in  the  following 
century  the  Sungarian  throne  was  seized  by  a  usurper, 
who  recognized  the  suzerainty  of  China,  and  then 
repudiated  it,  conduct  which  was  punished  in  1756  by 
the  Chinese  massacre  of  600,000  Kalmuks,  so  that 
Sungaria  was  completely  depopulated,  and,  becoming 
once  more  a  Chinese  province,  was  divided  into  seven 


FROM  ALTYN'IMMEL   TO  KULDJA.  203 

districts,  of  which  the  Viceroyalty  of  Hi  consisted  of 
three — Tarbagatai,  Kurkara-Usun,  and  Hi  or  Kuldja. 

China  now  proceeded  to  repeople  the  country  by 
sending  there  her  own  convicts  and  vagabonds,  by 
planting  military  colonies  of  Solons  and  Sibos  from 
Manchuria  and  Dauria,  by  causing  to  migrate  thither 
from  the  western  provinces  of  Kan-Su  and  Shen-Si, 
Chinese  Muhammadans  called  Dungans,  and  by  im- 
porting from  Kashgaria  other  Muhammadan  settlers, 
who  became  known  as  Taranchis.  Besides  all  these, 
in  1 771  there  began  to  return  from  the  Volga  region  a 
number  of  the  Torgout  tribe  of  Kalmuks,  who  had 
migrated  thus  far  before  the  destruction  of  their  kins- 
men, and  who  had  been  invited  by  the  Chinese  to 
come  back  to  the  haunts  of  their  ancestors. 

For  the  purpose  of  keeping  order  in  the  country, 
the  city  of  Hi  or  Manchu  Kuldja,  south  of  Suidun, 
was  built  as  a  seat  of  government  and  settled  by 
Manchus.  Six  other  forts  were  erected,  one  with  a 
Manchu  garrison,  the  others  being  defended  by  Chinese 
soldiers.  In  course  of  time  the  officials  so  oppressed 
the  Mussulman  inhabitants  that  in  1864  the  Dungans 
rebelled  and  killed  the  Manchus  and  Chinese  about 
Urumtsi  to  the  number  of  130,000.  The  wave  of 
rebellion  rolled  on  to  Kuldja,  where  the  Taranchis 
joined  with  the  Dungans,  and  completely  overturned 
and  massacred  the  Chinese  and  Manchus.  Then  the 
Dungans  and  Taranchis  fell  out  with  each  other,  met 
in  battle  in  April,  1867,  and  the  Dungans,  who  had 
everywhere  murdered,  robbed,  and  pillaged,  were 
badly  beaten,  and  so  the  Taranchis  became  rulers  of 
the  country.  Meanwhile  the  Russians  had  been 
quietly  looking  on  during  the  insurrection,  refusing 
help  to  the  Chinese  authorities,  and  declining  to  enter 


204  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

into  relations  with  usurpers.  Numbers  of  refugees 
fled  to  Russian  territory,  and  were  kindly  received  and 
located  as  colonists ;  but  when  the  Russian  border  was 


crossed  by  marauding  Kirghese  from  the  Kuldja 
territory,  and  when,  moreover,  it  looked  possible  that 
Yakub  Beg,  Governor  of  Kashgar,  fighting  successfully 


FROM  ALTYN'IMMEL   TO  KULDJA,  205 

with  the  Dungans,  might  proceed  also  to  Kuldja,  the 
Russians  stepped  in  and  seized  it  first,  and  promised 
the  Court  of  Peking  that,  so  soon  as  the  Chinese 
Emperor  could  restore  and  maintain  order,  and  pay  the 
expenses  incurred  by  the  Russians,  the  province  should 
be  given  back  to  the  Celestials.  The  fulfilment  of 
this  promise  had  been  claimed  the  year  before  my 
visit,  so  that  I  found  things  in  a  transitional  state,  and 
the  strengthening  of  the  wall  of  Suidun,  referred  to 
above,  was  in  anticipation  of  the  Chinese  return  to 
power  in  the  following  year. 

We  did  not  stay  at  Suidun,  though  it  was  late  in 
the  evening,  but  posted  on  past  the  ruined  Baiandai, 
formerly  a  town  of  nearly  1 50,000  inhabitants,  and  at 
midnight  arrived  at  Kuldja.  We  had  now  travelled 
from  Omsk,  a  distance  of  1,800  miles,  in  a  fortnight, 
having  our  clothes  off  to  sleep  only  the  two  nights  at 
Semipolatinsk.  There  are  no  hotels  at  Kuldja,  and 
as  it  was  too  late  to  present  letters  of  introduction,  I 
was  glad  enough  to  throw  myself  down  on  the  bench 
in  the  dirty  post-house,  and  there  to  sleep  till  morning.

The  Hi  Valley,  midway  between  Turanian  and  Chinese  races. — The

Sibos. — Visit  to  a  Sibo  encampment. — Their  household  gods,  and

and  marriage. — Foreign  influence  and  superstitions. 

THE  Hi  valley  may  be  regarded  as  a  half-way  house 
between  the  Turanian  races  of  Central  Asia  and 
the  Mongol  races  of  China.  Here  meet  the  settled 
Mussulman  Taranchi  and  Dungan,  with  the  Buddhist 
Sibo,  Manchu,  and  Chinese ;  as  well  as  the  nomad 
Muhammadan  Kirghese,  and  the  Lamaist  Kalmuk. 
This  variety  of  races  and  religions  cannot  but  be 
interesting  to  the  ethnologist  and  ethnographer  gene- 
rally, and  a  brief  description  of  some  of  them  will  also 
render  more  intelligible  my  future  narrative.  The 
most  numerous  of  the  populations  are  the  Taranchis,  of 
Turkish  race,  who  formerly  lived  in  Kashgaria,  and 
who,  after  rebellion  in  1756,  were  transported  by  their 
Chinese  rulers  to  the  Hi  valley.  They  occupy  the 
valley  north  and  south  of  the  river,  from  the  con- 
fluence of  the  Kungess  and  Tekess,  to  Kuldja,  in  about 


ETHNOLOGY  AND  ETHNOGRAPHY  OF  ILI  VALLEY,  207 

a  dozen  villages  ;  and  in  1877  numbered  28,000  males 
and  24,000  females,  or  about  40  per  cent,  of  the  popula- 
tion of  the  province. 

The  Taranchis  call  themselves  Sarts,  but  to  the 
Chinese  they  became  known  by  their  present  name 
from  their  occupation  as  agriculturists  or  millet  sowers, 
from  iaran,  ^meaLning  millet,  or,  according  to  some,  **  a 
ploughed  field.**  Mr.  Ujfalvy  calls  them  a  mixture  of 
Turco  Tatar  peoples  strongly  impregnated  with  Iranian 
blood  ;  but,  though  Turks  and  Muhammadans,  long 
contact  with  the  Chinese  has  modified  some  of  their 
customs.  Their  dress  consists  of  a  full  shirt,  drawers 
of  leather  or  cotton,  and  a  khalat,  with  a  sAuA  added 
in  winter.  Except  the  mullahs,  the  men  do  not  wear 
turbans,  but  fur  caps ;  whilst  women  and  girls  adorn 
their  heads  with  stiff,  low,  gaudy,  cylindrical  hats,  having 
conical  tops.  We  saw  ordinary  patterns  displayed  in 
large  numbers  up  to  20^.  each,  but  wives  of  sultans 
have  their  caps  adorned  with  jewels,  sometimes  to  the 
value  of  upwards  of  ;^ioo. 

A  pair  of  Kashgar  ladies'  boots  {Makhsa)  I  bought 
are  about  10  inches  high,  of  red  shiny  leather,  gorge- 
ously embroidered,  and  fitting  close,  but  without  a  second 
sole  or  heel.  They  do  well  for  house  wear,  but  for 
the  street  a  golosh  is  worn  over  them.  Now  and  then 
one  sees  among  the  women  a  pleasant  face,  but  they 
are  all  browned,  being  accustomed  from  childhood  to 
work  in  the  fields  ;  a  striking  contrast  to  their  Tashkend 
sisters,  who  remain  shut  up  in  the  house.  The  males 
shave  their  heads.  One  of  our  curious  sights  in  the 
bazaar  was  a  baby  boy  squalling  under  this  operation. 
Married  women  braid  their  hair  in  two,  maidens  in 
three,  long  plaits,  and  both  blacken  their  eyebrows,  but 
do  not  paint.     The  women   wear   rings   in   the  ears 


2o8  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

{untc/ia)y  and  upon  the  thumb,  whilst  the  men  thus 
adorn  the  third  or  ring  finger. 

In  their  houses,  in  Kuldja,  they  are  said  to  have 
introduced  improved  surroundings  and  furniture,  such 
as  bedsteads  and  tables,  at  which  they  sit  to  eat,  using 
stools  and  sometimes  even  chairs  of  simple  workmanship. 
This,  however,  was  not  the  case  in  the  house  of  a 
former  Taranchi  bek,  occupied  by  his  five-times  married 
widow,  wherein  lived  Colonel  Mayevsky,  whom  we 
visited  in  Kuldja.  In  this  case  a  large  proportion  of  the 
room  was  taken  up  with  a  raised  divan,  covered  with 
rugs,  and  the  dining-table  was  less  than  a  foot  high. 
At  their  feasts  one  may  see  the  Kashgar  dance,  in  which 
the  performer  accompanies  himself  on  the  tambourine.* 

The  Taranchis  have  a  national  song,  but  it  is  very 
expressive  of  sadness.  Most  of  them  speak  Chinese, 
but  their  own  tongue  is  Eastern  Turki. 

The  Dungans,  or  Tungans,  are  fellow  Muhamma- 
dans,  and  wear  a  skull  cap,  shaving  the  head  like  the 
Taranchis ;  but  in  language,  dress,  and  almost  every 
other  respect  they  resemble  the  Chinese.  Several 
guesses  have  been  made  at  the  etymology  of  their  name, 
and  their  origin  is  uncertain,  f 

*  In  another  dance  the  man  (accompanied  by  a  Chinese  fiddle,  and  a 
stringed  instrument  called  **  chitra,"  or  "cithara  **)  strikes  his  head, 
shoulders,  legs,  and  soles  with  a  bamboo  cane,  carrying  little  bells.  This 
latter  dance  is  unknown  at  Tashkend  or  Samarkand.  There  is  yet  a 
third  rollicking  dance,  in  which  the  Taranchi  wears  bells  round  his  neck, 
large  enough  for  horses,  and,  putting  himself  through  a  variety  of  contor- 
tions, elicits  from  his  auditory  furious  bellowing  by  way  of  applause. 

t  Some  think  them  descendants  of  the  old  Uighurs  ;  Terentieff  makes 
them  Turanians  converted  to  Muhammadanism  in  the  eighth  century, 
and  transplanted  into  China  to  the  province  of  Han-Su.  Legendary 
accounts  connect  their  coming  to  Kuldja  with  Tamerlane,  who,  they 
say,  married  a  Chinese  princess  and  received  the  province  of  Hi  to 
govern,  and  the  land  was  afterwards  given  to  his  followers.  Hence  the 
Dungans  consider  themselves  its  rulers  by  right.    According  to  other 


ETHNOLOGY  AND  ETHNOGRAPHY  OF  ILI  VALLEY,  209 

The  Dungans  throughout  Turkistan  are  supposed 
to  amount  to  20,000.  In  1862,  in  the  Hi  valley,  they 
numbered  60,000,  but  in  1877,  after  the  war,  they 
counted  only  2,100  males  and  1,900  females,  being 
chiefly  in  Suidun,  Chinchakhodzi,  and  Torji.  Some 
have  emigrated  and  others  been  exiled  to  Ferghana 
and  Semirechia,  in  which  latter  province,  about  Tokmak, 
they  number  4,000  souls.  The  Dungans  living  in  the 
towns  north  of  the  Thian  Shan,  as  Manas,  Urumtsi, 
etc.,  have  been  said  by  some  to  be  Chinese  turned 
Mussulmans,  but  Mr.  Ujfalvy  declares  this  to  be  abso- 
lutely false  as  regards  the  Dungans  of  Kuldja,  who  are 
of  a  type  quite  distinct  and  radically  different  from 
the  Chinese.  They  resemble  rather  the  Uzbegs  and 
Sarts,  inhabiting  Tashkend  and  Kashgar.  The  women, 
however,  are  like  the  Chinese,  except  that  they  do 
not  disfigure  their  feet.  The  Dungans  abstain  from 
spirits   and  opium  ;    neither  smoke  nor    take  snuff.* 

traditions  their  Mussulman  ancestors  subdued  China,  and  were  by 
degrees,  and  .partly  through  taking  Chinese  wives,  absorbed  in  the 
conquered  nationality. 

•  The  Dungans  are  of  middle  height,  and  inclined  to  be  stout.  They 
have  high  and  prominent  foreheads,  thick  and  arched  eyebrows,  eyes 
rather  sunken,  fairly  prominent  cheek-bones,  face  oval,  mouth  of 
average  size,  lips  thick,  teeth  normal,  chin  round,  ears  small  and 
compressed,  hair  black  and  smooth,  beard  scanty  and  rough,  skin 
smooth,  neck  strong,  and  extremities  of  average  proportions.  The 
characteristics  of  the  Dungans  are  kindness,  industry,  and  hospitality. 
They  engage  in  husbandry,  horticulture,  and  trade.  In  domestic  life 
parental  authority  is  very  strong.  After  the  birth  of  a  child  the  mother 
does  not  get  up  for  fifteen  days,  and,  without  any  particular  feast,  the 
child  receives  its  name  in  the  presence  of  a  mullah  the  day  succeeding 
that  of  its  birth.  Circumcision  takes  place  on  the  eighth,  ninth,  or 
tenth  day.  When  a  girl  is  married  she  receives  a  dower.  In  sickness 
they  have  recourse  to  medicine  and  doctors,  but  never  to  exorcisms. 
After  a  death  the  mullah  and  the  aged  assemble  to  recite  prayers  ;  the 
corpse  is  wrapped  in  white  linen  and  then  buried,  but  never  burned. 
On  returning  from  the  interment  the  mullah  and  the  elders  partake  of 
bread  and  meat.    To  saints  they  erect  monuments  like  little  mosques,

They  are  more  manly  than  the  Chinese,  and  de- 
cidedly superior  in  morals.  Baichas''^  are  [unknown 
among  them,  though  they  are  fond  of  gambling  and 
the  dance ;  but  the  two  sexes  dance  apart,  and  the 
women  never  in  public.  The  Dungans  dance  to  the 
sound  of  the  dumbra,  a  sort  of  guitar,  and  the  sabas,  or 
cymbal.  This  people  never  ceased  to  be  Muhammadans, 
though  their  fanaticism  has  been  somewhat  modified 
by  contact  with  idolaters.  They  follow  the  Mussul- 
man laws,  but  have  generally  only  one  wife.  On  the 
death  of  a  husband,  his  mother  inherits,  or  if  there  be 
none,  then  the  eldest  brother,  and  afterwards  the  widow, 
even  though  she  may  have  contracted  a  fresh  marriage. 
The  Dungans  do  not  take  oaths,  but  the  deposition  of 
witnesses  is  admitted.  It  is  assumed,  according  to 
Mr.  Hyde  Clark,  that  a  man  is  bound  to  speak  the 
truth.  If  doing  otherwise,  he  is  by  law  subject  to  the 
penalty  that  would  have  been  incurred  by  the  subject 
of  his  false  testimony. 

The  Dungan  weights  and  measures  are  Chinese,  as 
also  the  usages  for  the  purchase  and  sale  of  property. 
The  towns  are  always  fortified,  their  villages  not, 
and  the  houses  are  built  at  a  distance  from  one  an- 
other. Dungan  carts  are  large,  with  immense  wheels  of 
1 8  spokes,  and  drawn  by  three  or  four  horses.  The 
smaller  vehicles  have  peculiar  wheels  covered  with 
large  nails.  The  people  burn  coal,  candles,  and  oil 
lamps.  They  eat  five  times  a  day,  but  never  horse- 
flesh or  pork,  and  like  Chinese  vinegar  in  their  plates. 
They  are  particularly  fond  of  a  fruit  the  Chinese  call 
batsa,  a  kind  of  red  berry  the  size  of  a  raspberry.     It 

for  others  simple  hillocks.     The  widow  may  re-marry  after  90  days, 
and  on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  death  a  feast  takes  place. 

*Boys  kept  for  dancing,  and  sometimes  for  questionable  purposes.

is  sown  one  year  and  eaten  the  next,  after  cooking 
in  large  saucepans. 

To  the  two  settled  peoples  of  the  valley,  who  are 
Muhammadans,  should  be  added  34.OCX)  of  their  nomad 
co-religionists,  the  Kara-Kirghese.     Of  these  I  shall 


speak  in  a  later  chapter,  also  of  the  Manchu  and 
Chinese  as  1  met  them  during  my  stay.  The  Solons 
and  Sibos,  as  already  stated,  were  brought  to  the  Hi 
valley  as  military  colonists  from  Eastern  Manchuria. 
I  remember  hearing,  if  not  seeing,  something  of  a 
Tunguse  tribe  called  Solons    when   on    the  Amur  in 


212  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

1879,  and  as  Dr.  Schuyler  says  the  Sibos  speak  a 
Tunguse  dialect  similar  to  the  Manchu,  I  presume  they 
come  from  about  that  locality.  The  colonists  were 
divided  into  14  banners  or  sumuls,  afterwards  in- 
creased to  16,  the  Solons  being  settled  on  the  right 
bank  of  the  Hi,  and  the  Sibos  on  the  left.  We 
passed  through  the  Solon  district  between  At-kend 
and  Borokhudzir,  but  their  numbers  were  so  reduced 
by  the  war  that  only  800  were  left  in  1877,  and  these, 
by  the  immoderate  use  of  opium,  appear  to  be  doing 
their  best  to  destroy  themselves. 

The  Sibos  number  i8,cxx)  souls,  the  sexes,  numeri- 
cally, being  about  equal.  I  had  been  recommended  to 
visit  a  Sibo  sumul  as  one  of  the  sights  of  Kuldja,  and  we 
accordingly  did  so.  Of  the  eight  Sibo  sumuls  we  drove 
to  the  second,  and  arrived  at  a  rectangular  walled  town, 
with  a  chamber  over  the  gate.  In  this  room  were 
some  idols,  brought  thither  from  a  destroyed  temple. 
We  drove  through  a  long,  and  fairly  wide,  but  dirty 
street,  to  a  building  that  corresponded  to  a  town  hall 
or  house  of  public  business,  the  walls  of  which  were 
written  over  with  stories  in  Manchu.  We  were  next 
taken  to  a  **tanza,''  or  house,  as  I  supposed,  of  a 
dignitary.  The  principal  room  was  spacious  and  clean, 
but  the  furniture  and  ornamentation  were  principally 
confined  to  the  western  side,  where  were  a  hieroglyphical- 
looking  representation  of  a  tiger,  and  the  paraphernalia 
of  a  Buddhist  altar,  on  which  were  placed  xki^penates  or 
household  gods.  I  should  have  liked  to  have  purchased 
some  of  their  burkhanSy  or  idols,  but  they  would  not 
sell  them :  in  fact,  I  think  the  proprietor  was  not  there. 
I  had  taken  some  Scriptures,  in  Chinese  and  Mongol, 
but  they  could  read  neither  one  nor  the  other.  They 
said,  however,  that  the  men  of  the  sixth  sumul  could 


ETHNOLOGY  AND  ETHNOGRAPHY  OF  ILI  VALLEY.  213 

read,  and  that  books  should  be  sent  to  them  through 
the  Russian  Consul.  We  then  went  into  other  houses 
looking  for  curiosities,  when  my  eye  fell  upon  a  man's 
belt  with  a  clasp,  fastening  with  a  hook  and  eye  cut 
in  jade.  There  was  also  suspended  from  the  belt, 
of  the  same  material,  a  carved  lotus,  or  sacred  flower 
of  the  Buddhists.  I  bought  the  whole,  and  it  is  now 
in  the  British  Museum.  We  inquired,  likewise,  if 
any  in  the  town  were  sick,  and  were  taken  to  a 
miserable  hovel  little  better  than  a  shed,  where  was 


an  old  man,  somewhat  of  an  idiot,  with  fever,  but  not 
of  an  eruptive  character,  and  opposite  to  him  a  young 
man,  Mr.  Sevier  carefully  examined  him,  sounding  his 
swollen  and  dropsical  stomach.  His  ribs  were  dilated, 
the  liver  pushed  up,  heart  out  of  place,  and  arms 
Wasted,  whilst  his  pulse  was  beating  fast,  and  he  was 
suffering  from  bronchitis.*     We  had  not  the  necessary 

*  Whence  he  had  got  the  idea  I  know  not,  but  (perhaps  from  local 
superstition)  he  was  drinking  his  own  water,  and  this  was  not  the  first 
case  Mr.  Sevier  had  met  with.  He  directed  him,  of  course,  to  dis- 
continue it,  and  told  him  to  drink  milk. 


214  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

instruments  for  tapping  him,  so  that  directions  only 
could  be  given  that  he  should  be  brought  into  Kuldja. 
The  Sibos  are  said  to  be  excellent  gardeners,  and  when 
we  repaired  again  to  the  town  house  to  drink  tea,  they 
not  only  crowded  round  to  see  us  eat  and  to  partake 
of  what  we  offered,  but  they  brought  us  melons,  after 
which  we  returned  to  Kuldja. 

There  remains  one  more  tribe  to  be  noticed  in  the 
present  chapter,  who  are,  in  some  respects,  the  most 
interesting  in  the  Hi  valley,  because  they  are  the  least 
known.  The  Russians  have  long  had  the  Turanian 
nomads  under  their  rule,  but  not  so  in  an  equal  degree 
the  nomad  Kalmuks.  I  have  alluded  in  early  chapters 
to  the  migration  of  one  of  their  tribes,  called  Torgouts, 
to  the  Volga  towards  the  close  of  the  seventeenth  cen- 
tury, and  how,  after  the  annihilation  of  the  Sungarian 
Kalmuks,  the  Torgouts  were  invited  by  the  Chinese 
to  return.  They  did  so  in  1771,  and  were  allowed  to 
pasture  the  rich  lands  on  the  Kungess  and  Tekess 
rivers,  considerably  to  the  east  of  Kuldja,  where  they 
still  wander  under  the  name  of  Torgouts.  In  1876  they 
numbered  9,600  males  and  6,400  females. 

I  met  with  some  of  these  people  in  Kuldja,  from 
whom  it  was  easy  to  see  that  they  represent  the 
Mongol  type  in  comparative  purity,  reminding  me  of 
the  Buriats,  another  Mongol  tribe,  I  saw  in  1879. 
They  are  anything  but  good-looking.*  It  should  be 
added  that  they  are  good-tempered  and  generous,  but 
exceedingly  indolent.     They  are  credulous,  and  dearly 

•  The  Mongol  has  a  flat  face,  cheek-bones  prominent,  but  not  so  wide 
apart,  I  think,  as  with  the  Buriats,  retreating  chin  and  forehead,  small 
eyes  like  narrow  slits,  and  obliquely  placed.  Their  lips  are  colourless, 
set  in  a  strange,  almost  idiotic,  and  at  the  same  time  inexpressively  sad, 
smile.  The  teeth  of  the  men  are  large  and  white,  whilst  those  of  the 
women    are   stained  with  black.     The  hair   is   straight,  coarse,  and

love  anecdotes  and  stories.  Artificially  produced  gaiety, 
however,  is  followed  by  deep  melancholy.  Usually 
timid,  they  become  very  angry  if  irritated,  and  though 
not  remarkable  for  severe  morals,  they  excel  the  morally 
corrupt  Chinese,  than  whom  they  are  more  generous, 
frank,  and  hospitable.  They  use  no  flour  food  unless 
it  be  gruel ;  and  their  brick  tea  they  boil  with  milk,  fat. 
salt,  flour,  and  millet.  I  remember  being  treated  to  a 
cup  of  this  mixture  in  a  Mongol  dwelling  in  Siberia, 
and  my  **  accident  done  for  the  purpose  '*  in  upsetting 
the  cup  and  declining  with  thanks  to  have  it  refilled. 
The  cares  of  domestic  management  all  fall  upon  the 
women,  who,  according  to  M.  Ostroumoff,*  are  not 
noted  for  conjugal  fidelity,  in  connection  with  which  it 
should  be  mentioned  that  a  very  large  proportion  of 
the  males  are  lamas,  and  therefore  celibates  so-called, 
so  that,  the  proportion  of  males  to  females  being 
increased,  polygamy  is  encouraged. 

For  administrative  purposes  before  the  Russian 
rule,  and  now  again  I  suppose  under  the  Chinese, 
the  Kalmuks  are  divided  into  squadrons  (sumuns,  or 
sumuls),  each  of  200  tents.  They  constitute  the 
Chinese  irregular  cavalry.  Each  sumul  is  under  the 
direction  of  a  cleric  called  a  gelun,  and  a  laic  called  a 
zang.  The  gelun  has  the  right  to  promote  the  lower 
lamas  of  his  squadron  to  the  rank  of  getsuly  representing 

invariably  black,  the  beard  scanty  and  bristle-like,  and  the  skin 
rough  and  sunburnt.  They  are  below  the  middle  height,  with  broad 
shoulders,  and  long  arms  that  hang  idly  by  the  side.  The  legs  are 
bowed,  and  the  voice  harsh,  sharp,  and  strongly  aspirate.  The  coarse 
hair  that  is  left  unshaven  at  the  back  of  the  head  is  twisted  by  the  men 
into  a  long  queue. 

•  **  Chinese  Emigrants  in  the  Semirechia  Oblast,"  etc.,  by  N.  P. 
Ostroumoff,  to  whose  able  paper  I  am  indebted  for  information  con- 
cerning the  Kalmuks,  that  I  have  seen  nowhere  else.

a  third  clerical  grade.  The  gelun  must  be  a  celibate, 
must  shave  his  head,  fast  on  the  8th,  13th,  and  20th  of 
each  month,  abstain  from  wine  and  tobacco,  and  not 
wilfully  kill  an  animal,  even  an  insect.  The  gelun 
wears  on  ordinary  occasions  a  long  robe,  enveloping 
him  from  head  to  feet,  above  which  is  worn  a  yellow 
gown  with  wide  sleeves,  and  a  yellow  hat.  When 
conducting  religious  ceremonies  he  wears  many  other 
and  multiform  garments. 

The  gelun's  tent  is  always  placed  in  the  centre  of 
the  sumul,  and  is  distinguished  by  its  white,  thin  felt, 
and  prayer-inscribed  banner  floating  from  a  staff  at  the 
door.  Here  live  the  gelun  and  his  disciples  {shabi)y 
usually  five,  who  are  not  less  than  12  years  of  age. 
Some  of  the  disciples  are  simply  servants,  who  look 
after  domestic  arrangements ;  and  the  third  class,  called 
getsut,  assist  in  the  performance  of  religious  worship. 
The  gelun's  tent  is  also  the  house  of  prayer,  as  well 
as  a  dispensary,  whence  the  great  man  administers 
medicine.  His  tent,  like  a  chemist's  shop,  is  accessible 
at  all  times  to  all  persons,  whether  to  a  man  with  a 
sick  cow  or  seeking  a  strayed  horse,  or  one  about  to  go 
on  a  long  journey.  On  entering,  the  suppliant  places 
his  hand  on  his  breast  and  bows,  whereupon  the  gelun 
lays  a  holy  book  on  the  head  of  the  visitor  and  pro- 
nounces a  blessing.  The  gelun  is  maintained  partly 
at  Government  expense  (;^4  16^.  a  year),  but  chiefly  by 
his  scattered  **  parishioners,"  some  of  whom  he  visits 
weekly,  accompanied  by  one  or  two  of  his  disciples. 
On  arriving  at  a  collection  of  tents  he  is  joyfully 
received  by  the  Kalmuks,  who  regard  it  as  an  honour 
to  entertain  him  with  their  best,  and  give  a  feast 
usually  of  fresh  mutton,  tea,  and  kumiss.  He  says 
prayers  in  his  tent  at  the  prescribed  hours,  as  if  he 


ETHNOLOGY  AND  ETHNOGRAPHY  OF  ILI  VALLEY,  217 

were  at  home,  and  the  whole  of  the  aul,  men,  women, 
and  children,  come  and  ask  for  his  blessing. 

As  a  cleric  the  gelun  is  subject  to  his  spiritual  supe- 
riors, but  not  to  civil  jurisdiction.  He  is  supposed  to 
take  no  part  in  the  secular  affairs  of  the  people,  but  simply 
to  render  a  quarterly  report  of  births  in  the  sumun  to 
the  zang,  with  whom  he  is  considered  to  be  on  an 
equality.  Indirectly,  however,  he  can  influence  secular 
affairs  through  the  lamas,  who  are  numerous,  since  one 
of  every  three  brothers  in  a  family  adopts  the  clerical 
calling.  All  the  lamas  in  a  sumul  live  by  themselves, 
and  are  in  constant  relation  with  their  gelun,  and  receive 
from  him  personal  assistance.  The  gelun's  superiors 
are  the  heads  of  monasteries,  who  may  fine,  and  even 
inflict  corporal  punishment  on  the  geluns,  which  is  not 
often  done,  however,  on  account  of  the  tolerance  of  the 
Kalmuks  for  the  frailties  of  their  pseudo-virgin  geluns. 

The  zang,  or  civil  administrator  of  the  sumul,  ranks 
with  an  European  major.  His  tent  is  better  than,  but 
not  otherwise  different  from,  the  rest.  The  sole  dis- 
tinguishing mark  of  his  costume  is  a  hat  with  peacock's 
feather,  and  dark  blue  button.  It  is  his  duty  to  arrange 
the  turn  of  military  duty  on  the  frontier  pickets,  and  to 
mount  guards  over  government  horses.  He  also  inves- 
tigates non-capital  crimes  committed  in  the  sumul,  and 
may  award  from  27  to  54  blows  with  a  whip,  but  not 
more.  The  people  are  not  on  such  intimate  terms  with 
the  zang  as  with  their  spiritual  ruler.  They  appear 
before  the  zang  only  when  summoned,  and  kneel  on 
one  knee.  No  one  dare  sit  in  his  presence  without 
permission,  or  criticise  his  orders.  Usually  he  connives 
with  the  rich  and  oppresses  the  poor,  who  uncomplain- 
ingly submit. 

The   faith  of  the    Hi    Kalmuks  who  emigrated    to 


2i8  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Semirechia  and  were  baptized  was  that  of  Buddhistic- 
Shamanism,  which  the  lamas  diligently  propagated 
among  the  Solons,  Sibos,  and  Manchus,  very  similar, 
I  presume,  to  what  I  found  among  the  Buriats,  where 
old  Shaman  customs  still  lingered,  though  the  people 
had  accepted  Buddhism.  The  lamas  are  teachers, 
medical  sorcerers,  and  priests.  Hence  their  services 
are  continually  called  into  requisition  :  at  a  birth  to 
read  prayers  over  the  mother,  who  for  a  month  is 
considered  unclean,  and  to  name  the  child ;  later  to 
instruct  the  boy,  to  marry  him  when  grown  up,  to 
treat  him  when  sick  with  prayers  and  drugs,  and  after 
death  to  decide  whether  the  corpse  shall  be  buried, 
exposed  on  the  Steppe, — to  be  eaten,  I  presume,  by  dogs 
as  at  Urga, — or  burned.  The  lama,  in  fact,  appears  as 
chief  counsellor  and  teacher  in  all  the  important  events 
of  life,  and  supplies  his  parishioners  besides  with 
amulets  and  burkhans. 

The  Kalmuks  had  special  oratories  in  Kuldja,  and  a 
monastery  on  the  Tekess.  In  their  tents  they  have 
movable  burkhans,  or  idols,*  and  round  their  necks 
they  carry  amulets  made  of  short  prayers  sewn  on 
pieces  of  cloth.  When  journeying  they  wear,  besides 
the  ordinary  amulets,  a  burkhan  in  a  leather  purse-f 

Family  life  among  the  Kalmuks  possesses  greater 
freedom  than  among  the  Solons.  A  Kalmuk  girl  is 
a  shepherdess.  She  is  married  early,  without  much 
attention  to  her  predilections,  even  without  her  consent, 

*  Reminding  one  of  Laban,  Gen.  xxxi.  19,  34. 

t  Some  of  the  burkhans  are  painted  in  oil  colours  on  cloth,  some  are 
carved  on  copper,  or  cut  on  wood  and  stone,  baked  in  clay,  or  some- 
times printed  on  paper.  The  printed  burkhans  on  cloth  are  often  rolled 
on  a  wooden  cylinder,  and  tied,  but  unrolled  and  hung  in  the  tent  during 
prayer.  On  f^te  days  the  Kalmuks  place  before  the  burkhans  small 
copper  cups,  filled  with  Kunjut  oil,  and  ignited.  They  have  also  various 
perfumes,  one  being  prepared  from  a  finely-broken  brushwood.    Besides 


ETHNOLOGY  AND  ETHNOGRAPHY  OF  ILI  VALLEY.  219 

but  she  is  at  liberty  to  leave  her  husband  and  return 
to  her  relations.  Whether  she  likes  a  suitor  is  known 
by  her  leaving  the  tent  as  soon  as  the  marriage 
negotiations  commence,  or  the  reverse,  by  her  staying 
during  the  whole  conference.  The  parents,  however, 
seldom  regard  her  taste,  and  the  aspirant,  with  their 
consent,  watches  for  an  opportunity  of  seizing  the  girl 
and  carrying  her  off  by  force,  the  parents  considering 


their  duty  towards  their  daughter  fulfilled  if  only  the 
man  carry  her  off  without  their  seeing  it.  A  Kalmuk 
widow  may  marry  three  months  after  her  husband's 
death,  or  even  after  one  month's  mourning. 

The  Kalmuks,  who  lead  a  nomad  life,  cordially  hate 
the  settled  Taranchis,  Dungans,  and  especially  the 
the  burkhans,  religious  respect  is  shown  to  little  black  pyramids,  the 
size  of  a  pigeon's  egg,  with  Tibetan  letters  in  relief.  These  are  said  to 
come  from  Tibet,  prepared  from  a  miiture  of  clay  with  the  ashes  of 
pious  Buddhists  whose  corpses  have  been  burned.  The  pyramids  are 
carried  by  Kalmuks  in  copper  or  silver  cases  on  their  bosom  as  sacred 
amulets. 


220  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Kirghese.  Consequently  they  .have  come  very  little 
under  foreign  influence,  and  preserve  their  national 
languages,  both  written  and  spoken,  remain  faithful  to 
their  national  traditions,  and  love  their  own  peculiar 
songs.  The  women  are  particularly  fond  of  singing, 
and  take  parts  with  the  men.  What  foreign  influence 
reaches  the  Kalmuks  does  so  through  Buddhist  teach- 
ing, which  is  concentrated  in  Kalmuk  monasteries  and 
disseminated  by  means  of  the  lamas.  The  learning  of  the 
lamas  is  almost  limited  to  the  ceremonies  of  the  Buddhist 
religion.  As  a  mundane  element  in  Kalmuk-Buddhist 
literature  may  be  mentioned  a  certain  kind  of  medical 
knowledge,  which,  however,  is  not  the  heritage  of  the 
people  at  large,  but  only  of  the  lamas,  in  whose  hands 
it  assumes  a  form  nearly  akin  to  sorcery.  The  manner 
of  regarding  the  appearances  of  nature  was  borrowed 
by  the  Kalmuks  from  Buddhist  writings,  in  harmony 
with  which  they  explain  eclipses  of  the  sun  and  moon, 
rain,  hail,  thunder,  and  lightning.  The  Kalmuks  con- 
sider an  eclipse  of  the  moon  portends  general  poverty 
over  the  whole  land,  and  endeavour,  by  cries  and 
drumming,  to  frighten  from  the  moon  the  evil  spirit  that 
is  shading  the  light.  In  a  whirlwind  they  recognize 
the  soul  of  a  suicide.  The  Kalmuks  endeavour  to  get 
out  of  its  way,  or,  if  that  be  impossible,  they  think  to 
evade  its  influence  by  spitting,  as  if  shrinking  from 
contact  with  an  unfortunate  soul  reproved  by  God. 

I  have  thus  described  some  of  the  tribes  of  the  Hi, 
my  remarks  upon  their  government  applying  rather  to 
the  Chinese  than  the  Russians  ;  but  having  now  intro- 
duced to  the  reader  the  inhabitants  of  the  valley,  I 
shall  be  the  better  understood,  I  think,  in  detailing  my 
experience  during  our  stay  in  Kuldja.

WE  had  arrived  at  Kuldja  on  Saturday  morning, 
September  2nd,  to  find  that  most  of  the 
persons  to  whom  I  had  introductions  were  away. 
The  Governor,  General  Friede,  was  busy  on  the  fron- 
tier, the  line  of  which  was  then  being  settled ;  the 
Commander  of  the  Chinese  forces,  to  whom  we  had 
a  letter  from  the  Chinese  Legation  in  London,  was  not 
in  Kuldja,  nor  was  the  Chinese  Governor-General,  who 
lived,  it  appeared,  in  Suidun,  which  we  had  passed,  so 
that  we  should  have  to  see  him  on  our  way  back. 
The  next  on  our  list  was  Mr.  Paderin,  the  Russian 
Consul,  to  whose  house  accordingly  we  drove.  Here, 
again,  we  were  disappointed,  for  the  Consul  was  also 
at  the  frontier;  but  on  presenting  my  letter,  his 
secretary  saw  at  once  that  it  was  written  by  a  friend, 
and  begged  us  to  stay  at  the  Consulate.     The  praises 


222  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  AS/A, 

of  this  house  have  already  been  sung  by  Dr.  Schuyler 
and  Mr.  Ujfaivy,  both  of  whom  were  guests  therein 
when  it  was  occupied  by  Colonel  Wartmann.  The 
building  is  pleasantly  situated  in  a  garden  and  shrub- 
bery, and  its  spacious  rooms  were  furnished  with  such 
taste  as,  together  with  English  books  lying  about, 
made  one  long  to  converse  with  the  owner.  What 
advance  modern  conveniences  had  made  in  this  out-of- 
the-way  part  of  the  world  was  visible  in  the  drawing- 
room,  where  there  was  a  telephone  communicating  with 
a  distant  part  of  the  town. 

Mr.  Paderin  had  been  Consul  at  Urga,  in  Mongolia, 
and  when  transferred  to  Kuldja,  came  not  by  the  hum- 
drum way  of  the  post-road,  but  went  across  country, 
visiting  the  site  of  Karakorum,  the  ancient  capital  of 
Jinghis  Khan,  and  thus  deepened  his  knowledge  of 
Northern  Mongolia,  making  him  probably  the  first 
European  authority  upon  that  part  of  Asia.  An 
Imperial  order  had  been  published  in  the  previous 
March  that  a  consulate  should  be  established  at  Kuldja, 
with  annual  pay  to  the  consul,  in  silvery  of  5,000 
roubles  (;^75o);  secretary,  2,500  roubles  (;^375);  office 
allowance,  1,000  roubles  (;^i5o);  and  convoy  850 
roubles  (;^I2  7).  The  secretary's  office  and  quarters 
were  in  a  villa  in  another  part  of  the  grounds,  so  that 
we  were  to  be  lodged  in  the  great  house  alone,  save 
for  the  caretaker,  and  the  secretary  was  to  take  his 
meals  with  us. 

One  of  the  first  things  we  asked  to  be  allowed  to  do 
was  to  visit  the  Sibo  sumul,  or  encampment,  I  have 
referred  to  ;  and  finding  that  it  was  seven  miles  out  of 
the  town,  I  rather  foolishly  declined  to  go  on  horse- 
back, and  begged  that  we  might  drive  in  our  carriage. 
Horses  were  found  us,  and  a  Russo-Chinese  interpreter. 


A    SUNDAY  IN  KULDJA,  223 

and  off  we  started  at  the  dashing  pace  with  which  a 
Russian  coachman  thinks  it  proper  to  begin  and  end 
a  drive,  however  he  may  lag  in  the  middle.  Old,  or 
Taranchi,  Kuldja  was  founded  about  a  century  ago, 
and  is  a  rectangular  town  with  clay  walls,  30  feet  high, 
sufficiently  thick  for  two  carriages  to  be  driven  abreast 
on  the  top,  and  measuring  4  miles  in  circumference  ; 
the  work,  it  is  said,  of  2,000  Kalmuks,  driven  to  the 
task  by  the  Taranchis.  Two  large  streets  crossing 
each  other  divide  the  town  into  quarters,  which  are 
subdivided  by  smaller  streets  and  alleys.  We  made 
our  way  through  the  Taranchi  bazaar,  along  the  street 
of  which  runs  a  water-course  from  one  of  the  two 
rivulets,  Pensin-Bulak  and  Pilechi-Su,  that  water  the 
town. 

The  Taranchi  bazaar,  in  the  citadel,  has  shops  some* 
what  more  roomy  than  those  of  Central  Asia  generally, 
and  the  street  is  not  covered  from  rain  or  sun.  It  is 
paved  with  small  stones,  and  the  shops  are  kept  by 
stolid  Mussulmans.  Here  we  bought  our  first  ripe 
grapes  and  nectarines.  Apricots  ripen  at  Kuldja  at 
the  beginning  of  July,  and  we  were,  therefore,  too  late 
for  them,  but  of  late  peaches,  that  ripen  early  in  August, 
we  came  in  for  the  last,  flat  in  form,  about  an  inch 
and  a  half  in  diameter  and  half  an  inch  in  thickness. 
They  tasted  fairly  well,  but  there  was  little  flesh  on  the 
stone.  Most  of  the  Kuldja  fruits,  including  pomegra- 
nates, apples,  pears,  and  mulberries,  besides  those  I 
have  mentioned,  are  small,  since  the  trees,  through 
neglect,  may  be  said  to  be  almost  wild.  In  Suidun 
the  fruit  is  much  better,  so  that  after  the  arrival  of  the 
Russians  the  natives  of  Kuldja  began  to  graft  their 
stocks  with  Suidun  cuttings. 

As  we  drove  from  the  bazaar  towards  the  Hi  (J It 


224  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

means  a  river),  we  passed  through  the  Taranchi  gardens 
and  fields,*  to  find  a  swifi:ly-running  stream,  700  feet 
wide,  just  the  width  of  the  Thames  at  low  water  at 
London  Bridge  ;  and  when  I  saw  the  clumsy  ferry  into 
which  our  heavy  tarantass  had  to  be  lifted,  it  was  easy 
to  see  why  the  secretary  recommended  our  going  on 
horseback.  On  account  of  the  velocity  of  the  current, 
especially  when  it  is  windy,  the  process  of  crossing  is 
slow.  Usually  there  are  three  ferry  boats,  owned  by  a 
Russian  merchant,  and  at  the  time  we  crossed  there 
were  large  numbers  of  cattle  waiting  to  do  the  same. 
They  were  accordingly  tied  by  the  head  to  the  ferry, 
and  made  to  swim  after  it,  the  barge  being  filled  with 
vehicles  and  passengers.  Having  landed  safely  on 
the  opposite  side,  we  drove  across  a  low,  flat  country, 
almost  without  roads,  sometimes  through  ditcher,  and 
over  crazy  bridges,  that  kept  us  in  doubt  whether  or 
not  we  should  be  let  through  into  the  stream  below  ; 
but  having  at  last  reached  the  sumul,  we  inspected  it 
as  I  have  described  in  the  previous  chapter.  The  chil- 
dren thronged  around  us  full  of  curiosity,  but  people 
seemed  pleased  to  see  us,  only  that  our  interpreter  did 
not  speak  their  dialect  particularly  well ;  and  as  our 
ideas  passed  successively  through  English,  Russian, 
and  Chinese,  not  to  add  Sibo,  it  may  be  supposed  that 

♦  The  soil  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  town  is  sandy  clay,  and  very 
fertile.  This  is  characteristic  of  the  right  bank  of  the  Hi,  though  there 
are  parts  with  rich  mould,  and  extensive  marshes  overgrown  with 
jungle.  The  climate,  too,  is  suitable  for  gardening,  and  is  warm 
and  healthy.  The  summer  heats  go  up  to  106*^  in  the  shade,  but 
the  sultriness  is  considerably  reduced  by  summer  rains.  Thanks 
to  the  spring  showers,  grain  can  be  raised  about  Kuldja  without  the 
aid  of  irrigation.  Snow  lasts  for  about  six  weeks.  This  mild  climate 
is  accounted  for  by  the  sheltered  situation  of  the  valley,  the  Borokhoro 
range  protecting  it  from  the  north  winds.  The  prevailing  wind  is 
from  the  lowlands  of  the  Hi  on  the  west,  bringing  fogs  and  rain. 


A    SUNDAY  IN  KULDyA.  225 

we  conversed  with  difficulty.  Just  as  we  had  finished 
our  tea,  four  mounted  Cossacks  came  to  the  place, 
saying  that  the  Commandant  having  heard  of  our 
intended  visit  to  the  encampment,  though  he  did  not 
apprehend  our  being  harmed,  yet  thought  it  better  to 
send  us  a  guard,  and  they  had  arrived  at  the  Hi  just 
after  we  had  crossed,  and  so  failed  to  catch  us  up,  but 
that  they  were  now  ready  to  escort  us  back  when  we 
pleased.  We  therefore  started  speedily,  for  evening 
was  drawing  on,  and  we  did  not  reach  the  Hi  till  dusk. 
The  embarkation  from  this  bank  was  more  difficult 
than  it  had  been  from  the  other,  and  there  was  much 
ado  to  get  the  Cossack  horses  on  board,  for  they  had 
to  walk  in  the  shallow  water  and  then  jump  over  the 
side  of  the  barge.  One  little  horse,  at  a  word  from 
his  rider,  sprang  over  the  gunwale  with  the  agility  of 
a  cat,  although  the  others  had  to  scramble  up  in  a 
fashion  that  I  should  think  only  Cossack  horses  would 
do.  It  was  dark  before  we  reached  the  Consulate, 
but  we  had  spent  an  enjoyable  day,  and  were  quite 
ready  to  turn  into  bed,  for  this  had  not  been  vouch- 
safed to  us  more  than  twice  for  a  fortnight. 

The  morrow  being  Sunday,  I  had  thought  whether 
there  was  any  clerical  work  I  could  do.  The  Mussul- 
mans and  Buddhists  had  their  mullahs,  and  the 
Russians  had  their  priest.  I  heard  of  no  Protestants, 
but  I  had  both  heard  and  read  of  a  small  colony  of 
Chinese  Roman  Catholics  at  Kuldja,  amongst  whom 
Christianity  was  introduced  by  French  missionaries 
who  came  from  Peking,  some  say  a  hundred  years  ago, 
in  accordance  with  which  Mr.  Ujfalvy  states  that  he 
found  among  them  Latin  and  French  books  of  the 
last  century  and  beginning  of  the  present.  Mr.  Ashton 
Dilke  in  1873  stated  that  before  the  insurrection  these 

VOL.  I.  15

Christians  were  nearly  400  in  number,  but  that  300 
of  them,  including  their  priest,  Father  Thomas,  were 
then  massacred.  The  remainder  of  these  Christians, 
according  to  Dr.  Schuyler,  were  among  the  first  to 
welcome  the  advent  of  the  Russians.  The  Jews,  how- 
ever, have  no  dealings  with  the  Samaritans,  nor  have 
the  Greek  Catholics  with  the  Roman.  Consequently 
there  was  a  little  flock  surrounded  by  Russians,  Mussul- 
mans, Buddhists,  and  Pagans,  who  spoke  enthusiasti- 
cally to  Mr.  Dilke  of  their  murdered  priest,  and 
compared  Christianity  with  their  former  religion,  much 
to  the  disadvantage  of  the  latter,  still  holding  fast  to 
the  only  form  of  Christianity  they  had  ever  known,  yet 
doing  so  without  a  shepherd,  and  notwithstanding  that 
they  had  been  unvisited  by  one  of  their  missionaries, 
or,  so  far  as  I  could  learn,  had  any  communication  with 
head-quarters,  for  seventeen  years.  The  case  seemed 
to  me  both  interesting  and  pitiable,  and  I  wondered  if 
there  were  anything  I  could  do.  We  had  no  spoken 
language  in  common.  Mr.  Dilke  spoke  of  their  accent 
in  pronouncing  Latin  as  Italian,  but  said  that  some 
could  translate  it.  Dr.  Schuyler  thought  the  pronun- 
ciation **  at  least  singular,"  and  some  years  later  Mr. 
Delmar  Morgan  had  found  the  pronunciation  ''  wholly 
unintelligible  to  a  European  ear."  Mr.  Ujfalvy  men- 
tions, indeed,  that  some  of  them  could  read  Latin  and 
French,  but  then,  he  adds,  ''  without  understanding  it,'* 
so  that  it  seemed  clear  I  could  do  nothing  in  the  way 
of  preaching.  I  mentioned  the  matter  to  our  host  on 
Saturday,  and  begged  him  to  make  inquiries  of  the 
Roman  community  if  there  was  anything  I  could  do 
for  them.  The  secretary,  however,  did  not  see  his 
way  very  clearly  in  the  matter,  and  when  we  returned 
in  the  evening  he  had  another  plan  to  propose — namely, 


A   SUNDAY  IN  KULDJA.  '  227 

that  we  should  accompany  him  to  the  Russian  church 
in  the  morning,  and  visit  the  Romans  in  the  afternoon, 
and  to  this,  though  disappointed,  I  agreed. 

There  is  but  one  Russian  church  in  Kuldja,  and  that 
some  distance  from  the  Consulate,  on  the  outskirts  of 
the  town.  Two  Cossacks  came  to  ride  behind  the 
Consul's  carriage,  in  which  the  secretary  drove  to 
service,  and  when  we  reached  the  church  I  saw,  for  the 
first  time,  I  think,  a  Russian  church  that  departed 
from  the  usual  style  of  architecture,  and  that  was 
built  to  look  on  the  exterior  a  little  like  a  Chinese 
pagoda.  Inside  there  was  a  long  nave  with  aisles  and 
wooden  pillars,  and  the  building  approached  more 
nearly  in  form  to  the  interior  of  an  English  church 
than  anything  I  have  seen  in  Russia.  The  choristers 
were  soldiers,  as  also  those  attending  on  the  priest, 
and  the  full  congregation  appeared  to  comprise  the 
^lite  of  the  Kuldja  world.  After  the  service  I  gave 
some  Russian  tracts  to  the  Protoierea  (or  Dean) 
Bieloiarski.  As  we  returned,  the  military  band  was 
playing  the  national  anthem. 

At  lunch  the  secretary  had  invited  to  meet  us  a 
Polish  doctor,  who  inquired  if  I  would  baptize  his 
children.  I  was  somewhat  surprised  to  receive  such 
a  request  from  a  Roman  Catholic,  and,  that  there 
might  be  no  misapprehension  on  his  part,  asked 
whether  he  understood  that,  if  I  did  so,  according  to 
the  formularies  of  the  Church  of  England,  the  children 
would  be  regarded  as  Protestants  ;  to  which  he  replied 
it  were  better  even  so  than  for  the  children  to  grow 
up  heathens.  However,  he  said  he  would  first  consult 
with  his  wife,  and  also  let  me  know  whether  his 
family,  and  the  Chinese,  would  like  me  to  administer 
to  them  the  Holy  Communion  according  to  the  English 


228  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

service ;  for  my  opportunities  of  doing  anything  for 
them  seemed  shut  up  to  this,  and  knowing  the  exag- 
gerated, and,  as  I  think,  unscriptural  prominence  which 
Romanists  give  to  the  Lord's  Supper,  I  .thought  that 
after  such  long  deprivation  thereof  they  might  like 
to  join  in  the  celebration  of  this  sacrament,  even 
though  not  administered  according  to  their  own  form. 
The  doctor  returned  at  length  to  say  that  General 
von  Kaufmann,  when  in  Kuldja,  had  promised  to  send 
a  Roman  priest,  and  he  thought,  therefore,  it  might 
be  better  to  wait  for  the  baptisms,  but  that  they  would 
like  me  to  give  them  the  service,  for  which,  accord- 
ingly, I  prepared. 

We  found  the  chapel  in  the  outskirts  of  the  town, 
at  the  bottom  of  a  narrow  court,  where  I  think  most 
of  the  Chinese  Christians,  65  in  number,  were  living. 
They  received  us  with  a  smile  of  welcome,  appeared 
desirous  for  the  service,  and  conducted  us  to  a  room 
measuring  about  30  feet  by  20,  where  was  an  altar 
with  pictures,  candlesticks,  and  other  appurtenances, 
and  a  box  at  the  side  containing  some  of  the  minor 
vestments,  and  a  New  Testament  in  Chinese.  Here 
I  met  the  Polish  family,  whereupon  difficulties  arose, 
in  that,  as  Romanists,  they  would  not  partake  of  the 
cup,  and  next  they  remembered  that  as  they  were  not 
fasting,  but  had  dined ^  they  could  not  receive  the 
elements  at  all.  They  wished,  however,  to  be  present 
whilst  I  officiated,  and  so  remained  whilst  I  and  my 
fellow-churchman  communicated.  The  Chinese  per- 
ceived when  Mr.  Sevier  knelt  or  stood,  and  so  to  some 
extent  followed  the  service,  and  I  thought  perhaps 
they  would  have  communicated  when  they  saw  him 
do  so  ;  but  they  did  not  seem  to  comprehend  what 
was  expected  of  them,   and  I  proceeded  till,  coming 


A   SUNDA  V  IN  KULDJA .  229 

to  the  blessing,  I  lifted  my  hand  as  does  the  priest 
in  the  Greek  and  Roman  churches.  The  meaning  of 
this  they  perceived  at  once,  and  knelt,  thus  ending 
one  of  the  most  curious  passages  in  my  ecclesiastical 
experience. 

Could  I  have  seen  the  end  from  the  beginning, 
I  am  not  sure  that  I  should  have  acted  as  I  did, 
but  I  meant  it  for  the  best,  and  the  people  seemed 
grateful.  They  said  that  one  of  their  number 
occasionally  read  prayers,  and  the  Russian  priest 
sometimes  gave  them  a  **  benediction,"  but  I  think 
I  gathered  that  this  last  was  abnormal,  and  not  given 
with  very  good  grace,  so  that  they  had  no  other  public 
service.  I  did  not  gather  they  were  in  the  habit  of 
meeting  for  the  study  of  the  New  Testament,  and  I 
wondered  how  the  book  had  come  there,  for  though 
Messrs.  Dilke,  Morgan,  Schuyler,  and  Kostenko,  all 
speak  of  Latin  books,  and  Ujfalvy  adds  also  French, 
they  say  nothing  of  any  in  Chinese. 

I  had  brought  with  me  some  Chinese,  Mongolian, 
and  other  Scriptures,  and  was  willing  to  have  given 
them  several;  but  though  they  accepted  one  or  two 
copies,  they  did  not  appear  to  want  more.  They 
numbered  1 3  families,  of  whom  1 5  persons,  they  said, 
could  read.  I  asked  if  they  would  like  to  have  a 
missionary  sent  to  them,  to  which  they  replied  that 
they  had  not  discussed  the  question.  This  exchange 
of  ideas,  or,  perhaps  I  ought  to  say,  attempt  at  con- 
versation, was  attended  with  difficulty.  The  best 
interpreters  on  the  Consul's  staff  were  with  him  and 
the  Governor,  I  suppose,  on  the  frontier,  and  our 
interpreter  was  decidedly  feeble,  but  as  a  finale  the 
Chinese  brought  forth  tea,  grapes,  melons,  peaches, 
and   nectarines,   and   in   partaking   of  them    we  were 


230  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

joined  by  some  Russian  officers  who  had  heard  of  my 
conducting  the  service. 

Kostenko  says  that  as  a  rule  **  these  Kuldja  Catholics 
are  very  lax  as  to  the  essentials  of  their  religion.  They 
wear  crosses  round  their  necks,  and  read  prayers  in 
the  Latin  language,  and  they  made  a  request  (that 
is,  of  the  Russians)  that  they  might  be  permitted  to 
display  these  emblems  on  the  outside  of  their  dress." 
1  may  add,  however,  that  a  very  intelligent  Russian 
Protestant  in  the  region  told  me  that  among  their  own 
people  the  character  of  the  Chinese  Christians  stands 
high,  that  they  do  not  smoke  opium,  and  that  their  word 
can  be  relied  on.  The  persistence  of  this  handful  of 
Chinese  in  the  tenets  of  their  adopted  religion,  under 
such  unfavourable  circumstances,  reminded  me  of  my 
crossing  the  Pacific  in  1879  with  an  American  clergy- 
man who  had  laboured  as  a  missionary  among  both 
Chinese  and  Japanese,  and  who  regarded  work  among 
the  former  as  decidedly  the  more  hopeful.  The 
Japanese  he  allowed  were  more  readily  influenced, 
but,  like  children,  they  sometimes  drop  the  toy  that 
has  quickly  pleased  them,  whereas,  though  John 
Chinaman  takes  a  longer  time  to  be  convinced,  he 
is,  when  won,  more  easily  held.  I  have  since 
heard  that  three  Roman  missionaries  have  arrived 
in  Kuldja. 

After  bidding  the  Romanists  farewell  the  Russian 
officers  took  us  to  the  Buddhist  pagoda.  There  is 
only  one  in  Kuldja,  and  that  a  poor  one.  On  leaving 
the  street  we  passed  through  an  antechamber  into 
a  courtyard,  where  children  assemble  for  instruction 
in  the  tenets  of  Confucius,  each  pupil  holding  a  book, 
and  all  reading  together  as  in  Mussulman  schools. 
Crossing  the   courtyard   we   entered    the    joss-house 


232  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

and  saw  the  idols.  Against  the  wall  was  a  large  dais, 
with  various  eatables  arranged  thereon,  and  lamps  and 
vessels  for  incense.  Representations  of  dragons  are 
displayed,  as  well  as  suspended  banners  and  bells.  I 
did  not  see  any  adoration  performed,  but  Kostenko 
says  that  a  dirty  and  ragged  individual,  with  a  bundle 
of  lighted  joss-sticks  in  his  hands,  advances  and  recedes 
from  the  altar  with  endless  bowings  and  striking  of 
the  bells.  On  important  occasions,  instead  of  verbal 
prayers,  papers  with  petitions  written  thereon  are  burnt, 
in  the  belief  that  the  petitions  thus  dealt  with  will 
ascend  to  God  more  quickly.  I  did  not  observe  any 
prayer-wheel  such  as  I  saw  at  a  Buddhist  monastery 
near  Kiakhta  in  1879  ;  but  the  temple  at  Kuldja  was 
exceedingly  dingy,  dark,  and  dirty.  Here,  however, 
I  disposed  of  some  Mongol  and  Chinese  Scriptures, 
the  priest,  as  I  supposed  him  to  be,  or  attendant, 
thankfully  accepting  a  Bible,  and  two  other  men, 
apparently  poor,  each  purchasing  a  copy  for  £2. 

It  is  strange  that  the  Hindus  who  penetrate  through- 
out Turkistan  as  money-lenders  do  not  appear  to  have 
reached  Kuldja,  so  that  we  had  no  Hindu  temple  to 
visit ;  but  I  may  mention  two  other  religious  buildings 
we  saw  the  following  day.  One  is  the  Dungan  mosque 
near  the  Chinese  bazaar,  with  a  high  and  handsome 
minaret,  and  the  other  the  Taranchiy^w;;^^  (or  Friday) 
mosque  in  the  citadel.  The  latter  is  the  larger  and 
older  building,  restored  and  ornamented  under  the 
last  Taranchi  sultan,  Abil  Ogu.  Both  these  principal 
mosques  are  built  in  Chinese  style,  with  roofs  turned 
up  at  the  corners,  and  are  the  most  remarkable  build- 
ings in  the  town.  With  regard  to  educational  buildings, 
there  was,  in  1873,  a  '*  Kuldja  people's  school,"  with 
7  Russian,  i  Tatar,  i  Chinese,  and  25  Taranchi  pupils 


A    SU.YDA  Y  IN  KULDJA.  233 

There  were  likewise  13  Taranchi  elementary  schools 
and  2  medresses,  in  which  were  educated  314  male  and 
140  female  scholars;  also  i  Dungan  school,  with  20 
boys  and  g  girls,  and  2  Chinese  schools  with  20  boys. 
These  last  are  intellectually  the  best,  for  whereas  in 
the  Muhammadan  schools  nothing  is  taught  but  the 
Koran  and  Shariat,  the  Chinese  teach  arts  and  an 
extensive  literature. 


The  total  population  of  Kuldja,  according  to  my 
MS.  statistics  in  1878,  was  7,200  males  and  5,300 
females.  I  have  not  their  classification  at  that  date 
according  to  religious  professions,  but  in  1873  they 
existed  in  the  following  ascending  order  :  Protestants, 
Romanists,  Orthodox  Pagans,  and  Muhammadans ; 
whilst    the    various  races  at    the  same  date  prevailed 


234 


RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 


in  the  same  way  as  follows,  namely,  Dungans,   Sarts, 
Russians,  Chinese,  Taranchis.* 

In  the  vestibule  of  the  Buddhist  temple  lived  the 
Chinese  police-master,  upon  whom,  in  company  with 
the  Russian  officers,  we  called.  He  gave  us  pale 
yellow  tea,  with  oval  leaves,  about  i  J  in.  long  and  |  in. 
wide,  and  what  looked  like  blossoms  of  the  plant,  in 
the  cups.  It  was  no  doubt  thought  very  choice,  but 
for  me  had  little  flavour.  Looking  about  the  room, 
I  observed  a  guitar-like  instrument  with  three  strings, 
the  drum  being  covered  with  snake-skin,  such  as  I 
remembered   seeing  in   1879    in    Eastern    Manchuria.

There  was  also  in  the  police-master's  room  a  flute, 
about  two  feet  long,  with  ten  holes.  ,  Before  leaving  I 
offered  our  host  a  copy  of  the  Bible  in  his  native 
tongue,  which  he  accepted  ;  and  we  were  then  taken  to 
call  upon  another  Chinese  official,  an  officer  of  commis- 
sariat, who  welcomed  us  with  a  smile  to  his  rather 
dirty  house,  and,  when  asked  to  accept  a  Bible,  said  he 
had  heard  of  it  as  a  book,  the  reading  of  which  would 
do  a  man  good.  I  showed  him  my  Chinese  passport, 
and  he  said  it  was  well  that  I  had  it,  as  without 
it  I  might  be  liable  to  interference.  Looking  round 
his  room,  I  perceived  an  important-looking  package 
wrapped  up  in  yellow  silk.  I  learned  it  was  his  seal 
of  office  from  the  Emperor.  He  had  also  a  flat  box, 
two  inches  square,  with  a  compass  and  lid,  which, 
when  opened,  distended  a  string  intended  to  throw 
a  shadow  on  the  box,  and  thereby  act  as  a  pocket  sun- 
dial. The  officer  was  dressed  in  silk,  and  his  manner 
was  unusually  gay  for  a  Chinaman.  My  companions 
at  once  recognized  his  condition,  and  told  me  that  if 
he  took  only  a  little  wine  he  very  soon  became 
intoxicated,  but  that  the  cause  of  his  present  hilarity 
was  opium  smoking.  On  his  divan  stood  an  opium 
lamp  lighted,  so  that  our  visit  had  disturbed  him  before 
he  had  reached  oblivion.  One  object  we  had  in  calling 
upon  him  was  to  ask  him  to  inform  the  Chinese 
Governor-General  at  Suidun  that  I  hoped  to  have  the 
honour  of  calling  upon  him  on  my  return  journey  in 
two  or  three  days,  and  when  this  was  arranged  we 
returned  to  the  Consulate  to  dinner. 

We  had  now  visited  some  of  the  religious  buildings 
of  the  town,  and  I  had  distributed  my  books  and  tracts 
as  opportunity  served.  Mr.  Sevier  took  some  to  the 
Russian  hospital,  whither  I  did    not  accompany  him, 


236

and  I    heard  nothing  of  any  prison.*     This  was  the 
first  town  we  had  entered  where  Muhammadans  were 
so  numerous,  and  I  had  not  yet  forgotten  the  warning 
given  me  in  Omsk  as  to  the  danger  of  offering  them 
the  Scriptures.     Nor  did  I  know  how  such  a  course 
would  be  regarded  by  the  Chinese.     When  going  to 
the  bazaars  next  day,  howeyer,  I    took   in  the  chaise 
a  large  bag  filled  with  Scriptures,  and  whilst  looking 
here  and    there   for   curios   to    purchase,    I   presently 
offered  for  sale  a  copy  of  the  Gospels  in  Chinese  for 
5  kopecks.     It  was  bought  and  immediately  examined, 
with  the  result  that  others  came  to  buy,  and  those  to 
whom  I  had  sold  returned  to  purchase  more.     I  then 
offered  the  New  Testament  for  40  kopecks,  and  the 
Bible  for  60  kopecks,  and  was  amused  to  see  them 
comparing   the   size   of  the    Bible   with    that   of   the 
Gospels,  and  so  reckoning  what  ought  to  be  the  price 
of  the  latter  from  the  proportionate  thickness  of  the 
former.      I    was   now   besieged    by   purchasers,    who 
jumped  at  my  offers.     One  man  wished  to  buy  whole- 
sale, but  fearing  that  he  would  re-sell  them  at  exor- 
bitant prices,  I   preferred  to  dispose  of  them  myself, 
and  soon  came  to  the  end  of  my  Chinese  stock.     But 
the  Mussulmans  showed  equal  eagerness  to  get  Tatar

books,  and  my  remaining  Kirghese  New  Testaments 
were  fast  disappearing — one  Tatar  on  horseback  not 
only  paying  the  sum  demanded,  but  in  his  eagerness 
literally  snatching  the  book  from  my  hand.  Some  of 
the  Chinese  subsequently  came  to  the  Consulate  to 
purchase  more,  and  I  presented  some  Mongol  Scrip- 
tures to  the  interpreters  for  themselves  and  for  a 
school  of  which  they  told  me.  A  few  other  copies  of 
Mongolian  Scriptures  I  left  with  a  note  for  Mr.  Paderin 
to  distribute,  and  thus,  with  the  many  I  sold  and  others 
I  gave,  it  came  to  pass  that  I  emptied  in  Kuldja  my 
three  cases  of  books,  and  had  the  satisfaction  of  being 
the  first  salesman  there  of  the  Word  of  God.  This  I 
counted  a  greater  honour  than  to  have  marched  into  the 
city  at  the  head  of  an  army,  whether  it  were  the  half- 
wild  horsemen  of  Jinghis  Khan,  or  the  Cossacks  of  the 
Russian  Tsar.  The  latter  have  now  left  the  province, 
but  my  books  remain  as  seed  that  is  sown.  And  I  am 
content  to  wait  for  an  answer  to  the  question,  What 
shall  the  harvest  be  ?

ON  Monday  morning,  September  4th,  we  started 
early  with  the  Consul's  servant  and  an  interpre- 
ter to  the  Taranchi,  Chinese,  and  Sart  bazaars.  The  first 
was  noticeable  for  its  abundance  of  vegetables  and  fruit, 
large  melons  at  5  farthings  each,  and  the  best  apples — 
good-looking  but  tasteless  pippins — at  the  same  price, 
whilst  flat  peaches  sold  for  ^\d.  a  dozen.  These  prices 
for  local  produce  were  not  exceptional,  for  eggs  cost 
from  5^.  to  8^.  a  hundred,  and  fowls  from  \\d.  to  2\d, 
each.  Before  the  advent  of  the  Russians,  chickens 
cost  only  a  halfpenny  each.  Manufactured  goods  from 
Europe,  however,  were  dear,  and  even  Russian 
** family''  tea  cost  from  2s,  to  65'.  per  lb.*     I  secured 

*  The  following  are  fair  specimens  of  Kuldja  prices  at  ordinary  times : — 
Wheat  and  rice,  2S.  td,y  barley,  peas,  and  millet,  is,,  chaff,  4//.,  and 
clover,  3</.  per  cwt.  Mutton  and  beef  from  \d,  to  2</.,  butter  8^.,  and 
tallow  candles  4/f.  per  lb.  Russian  chintz  sells  at  *jd.,  and  ticking 
and  calico  at  iid,  per  yard;  fans  from  is.  to  lOi*.  each;  boots  from

some  Taranchi  rings  and  representative  jewellery,  and 
we  then  went  to  the  Chinese  bazaar,  where  among  the 
curious  things  exposed  for  sale  were  ready-made  coffins 
"  painted  and  all  complete  "  for  £\.  Throughout  this 
emporium  there  is  ceaseless  movement,  bustle,  and 
noise,  for  the  vendors  of  wares  scream  out  to  the 
purchasers,  and  amongst  the  inevitables  are  crowds 
of  children,  some  half  naked,  and  others  wholly  so, 
chasing  one  another  about  and  increasing  the  general 
hubbub  of  the  restless  scene.  Among  the  croiyds  of 
men  there  is  a  fair  proportion  of  Chinese  women,  in 
national  costume,  who,  owing  to  their  compressed  feet, 
sway  from  side  to  side  as  if  on  stilts. 

Trade  in  a  Chinese  bazaar  is  of  three  sorts :  first,  a 
regular  business  carried  on  in  shops  where  the  more 
expensive  articles  are  sold,  such  as  chintz,  tea,  sugar, 
iron,  etc.  ;  next,  a  casual  trade  done  at  a  stall  or  table 
in  cheaper  things,  such  as  common  soap,  mirrors, 
wooden  combs,  inferior  tobacco,  needles,  handfuls  of 
Russian  sweetmeats :  all  being  packed  each  night. 
Among  these  goods  we  observed  snuff  for  nose  and 
mouth — that  is,  for  sniffing  and  chewing.  It  was  done 
up  in  small  paper  packets  at  a  halfpenny  each.  Then, 
lastly,  there  is  the  hawking  trade,  carried  on  from  the 
familiar  basket,  or  it  may  be  from  the  hand,  selling 
eggs,  birds,  and  fruit.  I  could  see  very  few  Chinese 
curios  that  were  worth  buying.  Up  to  the  time  of 
the  Russian  occupation,  idols  could  be  bought,  and 
costly  objects  of  silk  and  porcelain  ;  but  their  purchase 

2S.  to  2ar.  per  pair.  A  cow  costs  from  30J*.  to  50^.,  a  horse  from 
£2  to  £ty  a  sheep  6i'.,  and  an  ox  from  50$".  to  £i^,  A  log  of  wood  14 
feet  long  and  14  inches  in  diameter  costs  4-$'.  A  plank  6  feet  long  and 
14  inches  broad  sells  for  2\d,,  but  the  same,  7  feet  long,  costs  \s.  Kiln- 
burnt  bricks  may  be  had  at  4^.  per  thousand,  but  sun-dried  bricks  for 
\od.  per  thousand  less.

by  the  Russians  has  sent  up  the  price,  and  now  they 
are  both  rare  and  dear.  I  secured  some  specimens  of 
Chinese  coinage  in  the  form  of  large  copper  money, 
with  Manchu  inscriptions  on  one  side  and  Chinese  on 
the  other.* 

The  Sart  bazaar,  called  in   Russian  Bazaar  ulitza. 


or  "  shop  street,"  we  found  inhabited  chiefly,  I  think, 
by  Dungans.  Here  it  was  amusing  to  see  how  every 
piece  of  old  iron  and  tin  was  saved  as  precious  and 

'  They  are  of  three  sizes,  the  largest  (equal  to  16  tachan  or  smal) 
coins)  called  Vrfunditackati  (or  2  lbs.  of  taohan],  the  medium  Yifun- 
ditachan  (or  i  lb.,  equal  to  8  tachan),  and  the  smallest  Ban/unditachan 
(or  J  lb.).  1  am  uncertain  whether  it  was  the  smallest  of  these  three, 
or  a  separate  coin  called  Yarmak,  which,  at  the  occupation  by  the 


TARANCHI  KULDJA,  241 

exposed  for  sale,  even  to  empty  sardine  and  blacking 
boxes.  They  positively  gave  me  \\d.  as  the  price  for 
an  empty  lobster  tin  !  In  this  bazaar  I  purchased  a 
pair  of  silver  hair-pins,  such  as  are  worn  among  the 
Dungans  by  married  women  only.  They  are  now  in 
the  British  Museum. 

A  feature  noticeable  to  a  European  in  the  Kuldja 
bazaars  is  the  native  restaurants,  where  those  who  can 
face  the  ordeal  may  be  satiated  for  6^.  The  variety  of 
dishes  in  the  restaurants  is'  great.  They  are  highly 
spiced  with  saffron,  but  it  is  not  whetting  to  the  appe- 
tite to  have  to  pass  through  the  kitchen  and  see  the 
cook  preparing  the  viands,  or  swinging  the  dough,  as 
we  saw  one  man  doing,  in  pendulous  fashion,  for 
making  long  twisted  loaves.  Chinese  bread,  though 
white,  is  unleavened,  badly  baked,  and  tasteless. 
Again,  it  is  not  pleasant  to  remember  that  the  Chinese 
eat  all  kinds  of  meat,  dogs  included,  so  that  it  is  wise 
to  give  charge  beforehand  as  to  what  shall  be  cooked. 
Chinese  butchers  sell  mutton  and  beef  without  bones. 
The  bones  form  a  separate  trade,  and  are  bought  by 
the  poor,  who  make  of  them  soup,  and  add  morsels  of 
meat. 

The  foregoing  description  of  the  bazaars  of  Kuldja 
does  not  give  a  lofty  idea  of  the  importance  of  its 
trade,  which,  in  fact,  is  very  small,  though  there  are 
650  shops  in  the  town.  Sarts  from  Tashkend,  Khokand, 
and  Kashgar,  together  with  Tatars  from  Vierny  and 
Kopal,  carry  on  the  best  trade.* 

Russians,  were  so  numerous,  and  of  so  little  value  (125  equal  a  farthing) 
that  they  were  exported  by  the  ton  to  Tashkend  to  be  used  in  the 
preparation  of  verdigris.  Of  other  Chinese  money  may  be  mentioned 
the  silver  Yamb,  weighing  about  66  ozs.  avoirdupois,  and  Sar-kumysh 
(value  4J.),  equal  to  10  miskal  {y^Syx^  5</.). 
*  In  1875  there  were  imported  into  the  town — glass,  iron,  and  manu-

242  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

We  were  taken  from  the  bazaar  through  an  oil-shop 
to  one  of  the  industries  of  Kuldja,  which  are  at  as  low 
an  ebb  as  the  general  trade.  In  this  oil  factory  pres- 
sure was  brought  to  bear  upon  the  linseed  and  mustard 
seed  softened  by  heat,  by  means  of  a  long  trunk  of 
timber  employed  in  a  most  clumsy  fashion.  The  oil 
is  used  'for  eating,  lubrication,  and  lamps,  whilst  the 
cake,  out  of  which  the  oil  has  been  pressed,  is  given 
as  food  to  oxen.  The  soap  they  make  is  of  the 
coarsest  quality,  and  smells  horribly.  There  are  no 
large  silk  or  carpet  factories  in  Kuldja,  though  silk- 
spinning  is  prosecuted  on  a  small  scale.  Cast-iron 
foundries  exist,  out  of  which  the  goods  come  for  the 
most  part  blistered  ;  also  a  large  room  where  paper  is 
made  of  hemp,  very  coarse  and  dark,  but  which  the 
Chinese  use  for  wTiting.  The  natives  are  fond  of 
vermicelli,  and  manufacture  it  for  id,  per  lb.  They 
have  also  a  factory  for  sweetmeats  made  of  rice,  boiled, 
and  then  allowed  to  ferment,  the  comfit  being  luscious, 
but  sticky   to  the    last   degree.     In    the   vinegar  dis- 

factured  goods,  khalats,  dried  apricots  and  raisins,  tea,  leather  and 
wooden  articles,  chintz,  nankin,  calico,  plush,  cloth  called  mata,  and 
felt,  together  with  horses  and  sheep,  to  the  value  of  ;^44,020,  the  mer- 
chandise coming  from  15  localities,  all  Russian,  except  Kashgar  and 
Bokhara.  There  should  also  be  mentioned  among  imports  from  the 
East,  gold,  silver  yambs,  and  nephrite,  or  jade,  which  the  Chinese  call 
**  Ztsc/iL**  This  stone  is  used  for  mouthpieces  of  pipes,  rings,  and 
amulets,  as  well  as  for  ornaments  for  the  hats  of  the  Kalmuks  and  Sibos. 
I  was  glad  to  secure  from  a  man,  on  my  visit  to  the  Sibo  encamp- 
ment, an  archer's  ring,  worn  on  the  thumb,  of  exceedingly  pretty 
jade.  The  stone  costs  from  one  shilling  to  eight  guineas  per  lb.  On 
the  other  hand,  there  were  exported  from  Kuldja  merchandise  to 
the  value  of  ;^24,oi6  to  8  localities,  6  of  which  were  Russian : 
the  articles  consisting  of  brick  tea,  oil,  flour,  raw  hides,  grain, 
fruit,  sheep's  fat,  tobacco,  Chinese  honey  and  vermicelli,  salt,  paper, 
dressed  lambskins,  horses,  sheep,  camels,  homed  cattle,  small  wares, 
iron  goods,  fox  skins,  and  deer  horns.  These  last  are  bought  up 
by  the  Chinese  at  Kiakhta,   and  are  said  to  be  used  by  them  as  a

tillery  they  allow  wheat  to  ferment,  which,  after  boiling, 
produces  a  sour,  green  essence,  ver)'  disagreeable  to 
European  taste,  but  appreciated  by  the  Chinese.* 

On  leaving  the  bazaars,  we  were  anxious,  if  possible, 
to  get  a  peep  at  the  Kalmuks.  On  our  way  to  the 
suburbs,  we  saw  a  Chinaman  in  the  street,  surrounded 
by  a  crowd.  He  had  a  drum  and  iron  clappers,  and 
was  entertaining  his  auditory  by  telling  stories.  On 
the  previous  day  we  had  seen  a  street  acrobat,  one  of 
whose  standing  or  walking  feats  was  to  raise  one  foot 
t6  his  breast  and  strike  the  sole  with  his  palm ;  a  second 
man  meanwhile  beating  a  gong.  On  reaching  the 
Kalmuk  tent  we  found  the  owner  absent,  though  his 
wife  was  at  home  with  some  small,  but  by  no  means 
bashful,  children.  We  looked  round  for  ethnological 
objects.  There  was  a  leather  kumiss  bottle,  but  this 
the  woman,  in  the  absence  of  her  lord  and  master, 
would  not  sell.  She  had  in  her  ears,  however,  silver 
rings,  with  stones  ;  and  as  she  confided  to  us  that  she 

medicine  in  cases  of  exhaustion  of  strength.  At  Kiakhta,  in  1877,  the 
Chinese  merchants  realized  a  profit  on  maral  horns  of  £^;ooo.  One 
Russian  firm  purchased  200  pairs  for  ;^  1,200,  and  Messrs.  Tokmakoff, 
of  whom  I  know  something,  bought  40  pairs  for  ;f  350.  These  prices, 
however,  were  unusually  high. 

•  There  were  throughout  the  town,  according  to  my  statistics  for 
1878,  3i30i  houses,  25  caravanserais,  i  school,  23  medresses,  i  Russian 
church,  57  mosques,  22  windmills,  and  4  stamping  mills  or  presses. 
The  total  number  of  industrial  buildings  in  1873  numbered  38,  pro- 
ducing manufactures  to  the  value  of  ;^3,ooo,  and  employing  131 
workmen.  The  number  of  handicraftsmen  in  the  town  at  the  same 
date  numbered  238  Taranchis,  5  Dungans,  and  66  Chinese,  concerning 
which  last  it  may  be  observed  that  they  knew  all  the  trades,  but 
neither  silversmiths  nor  tailors  were  found  among  the  other  natives. 
Carpenters  and  masons  earn  wages  at  the  rate  of  ij*.  a  day ;  labourers

not  much  prosecuted  by  the  inhabitants  of  the  town,  who,  in  1878, 
owned  300  camels,  6,000  horses  and  asses,  2,000  homed  cattle,  27,000 
sheep,  and  3,600  goats.

was  57  years  old,  and  had  received  them  on  her 
marriage,  I  perceived  these  could  be  of  no  Russian 
manufacture,  but  representative  of  Kalmuk  art  half  a ' 
century  ago.  I  therefore  pressed  her  to  sell  me  one. 
which  she  did,  and  it  is  now  in  the  ethnological 
department  of  the  British  Museum. 

Comparatively  little  is  known  in  detail  of  the  Kalmuk 
camping-grounds  at  the  eastern  end  of  the  IH  valley. 


The  most  renowned  of  Russian  travellers  who  have 
passed  that  way  out  of  the  valley  into  Mongolia  is 
Colonel  Prejevalsky.  In  1876  he  started  from  Kuldja, 
made  his  way  along  the  Hi,  and  its  upper  arm,  the 
Kungess,  until  he  reached  its  tributary,  the  Tsagma. 
This  brought  him  by  the  Narat  pass  to  the  Yuldus 
plateau,  described  by  the  Kalmuks  as  "  an  admirable, 
cool,  and  productive  country,  fit  for  gentlemen  and 
cattle  to  inhabit."  From  this  place  Prejevalsky  pushed 
his  way  to  Lob  Nor,  but  not  before  he  had  shot 
some  fine  specimens  of  the  Central  Asian  species  of 
mountain  sheep. 


TARANCHI  KULDJA.  J45 

I  saw  at  the  Kuldja  consulate,  as  also  at  Tashkend. 
specimens  of  the  skull  and  horns  of  this  remarkable 
animal,  which  is  bigger  than  a  donkey.* 

The  animal's  horn  is  more  than  four  times  the 
length  of  the  skull.  All  round  the  neck  there  is  a 
pure  white  mane,  and  the  light  greyish  brown  of  the 
sides  shades  off  into  white  towards  the  belly,  the  legs 
being  brown.      It  inhabits  high  hilly  plains,  and  runs 


with  great  speed.  The  Cossacks  say  that  the  wild 
sheep,  in  jumping  from  one  rock  down  to  another, 
alight  on  their  horns — a  statement  that  Dr.  SevertsofT 
thinks  improbable,  though,  since  the  head  and  horns  of 
one  he  shot  weighed  upwards  of  70  lbs.,  he  seems  to 

•  When  Marco  Polo,  600  years  ago,  told  of  the  enormous  sheep  he  had 
seen  on  the  mountains,  his  words  were  regarded  as  "  travellers'  tales," 
but  subsequent  explorers  have  proved  the  traveller  right,  and  the  largest 
variety  is  now  named  after  him,  Ovis  Polii.  Dr.  Severtsoff  gives  its 
length  as  6  ft.  9  in.  from  nose  to  tail ;  height  at  shoulder,  j  ft.  10  in. ; 
length  of  hom,  4  ft.  9  in.  ;  distance  between  tips  of  horns,  3  ft.  6  in.  ; 
length  of  skull,  i  ft.  2  in. 


246  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

think  It  just  possible  such  a  weight  might  cause  the 
animal  to  lose  its  balance.* 

Colonel  Prejevalsky  on  the  Yuldus  saw  herds 
of  30  or  40  of  the  Ovis  Polii,  and  gives  the  measure- 
ment of  the  horns  of  the  old  males  in  his  collection  as 
4  feet  8  inches,  with  a  thickness  of  18  inches  at  the 
base,  and  their  weight  about  36  poods. f  Mr.  Serge 
Alpheraky,  however,  another  traveller  from  Russia, 
who  has  penetrated  the  Kalmuk  camping-grounds,  and 
who  in  1879  followed  Colonel  Prejevalsky's  track  as 
far  as  the  Yuldus  plateau,  with  the  object  of  collecting 
butterflies  and  moths,  doubts  whether  any  other  species 

•  Dr.  Severtsoff  shot  an  old  ram  that  proved  too  heavy  for  a  strong 
mountain  camel  to  cany.  This  camel  required  four  hours  to  accom- 
plish three  miles,  and  was  obliged  to  lie  down  several  times  during  the 
journey.  At  low  elevations  a  camel  can  carry  600  lbs.  with  ease,  and 
on  lofty  plains,  where  the  air  is  rarefied,  400  or  450  lbs.,  so  that  the 
weight  of  this  specimen  was  estimated  at  about  600  lbs.  The  same 
authority  distinguishes  three  other  species  of  wild  mountain  sheep  in 
Turkistan  {Ovis  Karelini^  O,  Hetnst,  O.  Nigrimontana),  and  gives  an 
instance  of  the  strength  and  tenacity  of  the  Ovis  Karelini,  the  next 
largest  to  the  Ovis  Polii.  In  hunting  an  old  male  it  was  hit  by  him  five 
times,  each  time  with  a  good-size  bullet,  and  only  the  sixth  bullet 
brought  him  down.  The  first  bullet  hit  the  animal  between  the  hind 
legs  in  the  left  testicle,  the  pain  of  which  hindered  its  running,  though 
even  then  two  men  had  to  follow  it  for  an  hour.  Two  bullets  had  struck 
the  horns,  the  animal  each  time  falling  to  the  ground,  but  within  a 
minute  rising  again.  Neither  of  the  next  two  bullets  sufficed  to  stop 
the  creature,  though  one  of  them  penetrated  the  liver  and  the  other  the 
lungs,  and  it  was  only  on  receipt  of  the  sixth  bullet,  penetrating  the 
heart,  that  the  sheep  succumbed. 

t  Sir  Victor  Brooke,  who  has  studied  the  subject  closely  (Proceedings 
of  Zoological  Society  of  London,  1875),  mentions  the  following  mountain 
sheep  found  elsewhere  than  in  Turkistan,  but  which  he  is  disposed  to 
think  had  their  birthplace  in  the  Himalayas,  namely:  Ovis  Amman , 
O,  Hodgsoniiy  O.  Brookei^  O,  Nivicola,  and  some  others.  Nearly  allied 
to  O,  Nivicola  is  the  O.  Montana  of  North  America.  I  have  measured 
the  horns  and  skull  (weighing  32  lbs.)  of  a  very  fine  specimen  in  the 
collection  of  Mr.  H.  Seton-Karr.  It  was  shot  by  him  in  the  Rocky 
Mountains,  and  measures :  length  of  skull,  13  in. ;  of  horn,  38  in. ;  cir- 
cumference at  base,  16^  in.  ;  from  tip  to  tip  in  a  straight  line,  20^  in.

but  the  O.  Heinsii  inhabits  the  Yuldus.*  He  observed 
28  species  of  mammals,  6  of  fishes,  and  17  of  reptiles, 
etc.,  and  collected  specimens  of  the  greater  part  in 
series,  which  now  belong  to  the  Imperial  Academy  of 
Science  at  Petersburg.  Among  birds  of  the  Hi  valley 
may  be  mentioned  pheasants,  geese  and  ducks,  cranes, 
bustards,  grebes,  snipe,  plovers,  etc.,  sea  and  other 
eagles,  and  kites.

•  Mr.  Alpheraky  writes  to  me  that  he  brought  home  a  good  series 
of  the  species  of  Ovis  that  inhabits  the  Yuldus.  Both  Dr.  Strauch  and 
he  judge  them  to  be  O.  Heinsii,  He  says :  **  We  once  saw  a  herd  of 
2,000  of  these  sheep.  Herds  of  200  and  300  are  met  with  rather  often. 
My  13  specimens  are  now  at  the  museum  of  the  Imperial  Academy  of 
Science  at  Petersburg.  They  are  of  immense  size,  and  are  the  biggest 
of  the  rich  collection  of  Ovis  there.  I  have  also  given  to  the  Academy 
a  complete  skeleton  of  an  old  and  immense  ram  of  this  species."  Mr. 
Alpheraky  then  adds  a  list  of  vertebrata  observed  by  him  in  the  Kuldja 
district,  as  follows : — 

Mammalia.

The  Swallowtail  {PapHio  Machaon)  is  generally  distributed  through- 
out the  Kuldja  country,  and  differs  in  no  respect  from  the  form  that 
frequents  our  English  fens.  The  Wood-white  {^Leucophasia  Sina^is) 
occurs  in  Kuldja,  and  also  in  the  Ural  mountains.  The  Large  White 
{Pieris  Brassiccs),  so  destructive  to  cabbage  and  other  esculent  plants, 
does  not  appear  to  be  very  common,  one  or  two  examples  only  coming 
in  Mr.  Alpheraky's  way.  The  Bath  White  {Pier is  Dapiidice),  that  is 
such  a  prize  to  the  English  lepidopterist,  seems  moderately  common 
up  to  10,000  feet  in  the  Thian  Shan ;  and  the  Orange  Tip  [Anthocaris 
Cardatnines),  which  adds  somewhat  to  the  charms  of  English  lanes 
towards  the  end  of  spring,  is  also  found  near  the  Hi.  The  Silver- washed 
Fritillary  [Argynnis  Papkid)  is  as  common  on  the  Kungess  as  in  the 
New  Forest  in  Hampshire.  There  is  a  race  of  the  female,  which  is 
intermediate  between  the  type  and  the  aberrant  form  Valezina  (so  well 
known  to  those  who  have  taken  the  insect  near  Brockenhurst,  Hants). 
On  the  Kungess  it  quite  supplants  the  typical  female.  The  Dark-green 
Fritillary  {Argynnis  Aglaia)  is  found  along  the  course  of  the  Kungess 
up  to  8,000  feet,  and  even  on  the  Yuldus  it  is  said,  2,000  feet  higher, 
where,  however,  it  is  rare.  The  High  Brown  Fritillary  {Argynnis 
Adippe)  is  found  in  the  same  region,  as  also  the  Queen  of  Spain 
Fritillary  {Argynnis  Lathonia),  which  with  us  is  a  very  rare  visitant 
even  on  the  south-east  coast,  but  appears  to  be  widely  distributed  in 
Central  Asia,  though  nowhere  common,  occurring  up  to  an  altitude  of  .

the  Baratol  on  the  north,  is  Dr.  Regel  who  travelled 
to  Turfan  in  1879.  Of  the  two  Englishmen  who 
preceded  me  in  this  region,  Mr.  Ashton  Dilke  in  1873 
went  down  into  the  Baratol  valley  from  Sairam  Nor  to 
Ebi  Nor,  and  then  returning  to  Kuldja  he  ascended  to 

9,000  feet.  The  specimens  from  the  Thian  Shan  are  perhaps  pajer  than 
those  in  British  collections.  The  Glanville  Fritillary  {Melitcea  Cinxia) 
is  a  mountain  insect  in  the  Kuldja  district,  and  only  to  be  met  with 
here  and  there  at  an  altitude  of  4,000  or  5,000  feet.  The  specimens 
are  inferior  in  size  to  those  from  the  Isle  of  Wight ;  but  the  markings 
of  the  Asiatics  are  rendered  more  conspicuous  by  the  dark  ground 
colours,  and  especially  so  in  the  female,  in  which  the  yellow  colour  of 
the  underside  is  almost  entirely  replaced  by  a  grey  blackish  hue.  The 
Small  Tortoiseshell  (  Vanessa  Urticce),  though  not  so  abundant  in  Central 
Asia  as  in  England,  is  nevertheless  in  many  localities  a  common  butterfly. 
Hybemated  individuals  are  to  be  seen  in  early  spring  busy  in  securing 
a  succeeding  generation,  which  appears  in  the  winged  state  in  July,  and 
continues  abroad  till  the  frost  sets  in,  and  forces  it  to  retire  into  winter 
quarters.  Some  specimens  are  of  much  larger  size  than  ours,  and  the 
warmer  portion  of  the  coloration  of  these  giants  assumes  a  brilliant 
red-yellow  tint.  The  Central  Asian  peacock  ( Vanessa  lo)^  found  in 
August,  does  not  differ  from  our  own,  whilst  the  Camberwell  Beauty 
on  the  Hi  agrees  well  with  the  European  type,  and  specimens  fresh  from 
the  chrysalis  make  their  appearance  in  July.  The  Red  Admiral 
(  Vanessa  Atalanta)  was  seen  by  Mr.  Alpheraky,  but  the  Painted  Lady 
{Vanessa  Cardui)  was  scarce  in  1879.  The  Central  Asian  specimens 
of  the  latter  do  not  exhibit  any  appreciable  difference  from  our  insular 
form  so  abundant  on  the  southern  coasts.  The  Green  Hairstreak 
(Thecla  Rubt)  occurs  around  Kuldja,  but  not  so  commonly  as  with  us, 
and  the  Brown  Hairstreak  (7]4^f/fl  Behilai\  the  female  of  which  differs 
from  European  representatives  by  having  the  orange  blotch  on  the  fore 
wings  of  larger  size.  In  the  Thian  Shan  district  the  Small  Copper 
(Polyotnmatus  Phlceas^  becomes  a  mountain  species,  flying  at  8,000 
or  9,000  feet,  and  it  is  noteworthy  that  these  mountaineers  are  larger 
than  lowland  specimens.  The  Common  Blue  butterflies  {Lyccena  A  lexis) 
from  the  Kungess  are  generally  superior  in  size  to  English  ones,  the 
wings  of  some  measuring  from  tip  to  tip  36  millimetres.  With  regard 
to  the  Holly  Blue  {Lyccena  Argiolus)^  which  is  apparently  of  riparial 
habit  in  Central  Asia,  the  black  border  of  the  wings  in  the  female  is 
often  much  broader  than  in  the  form  taken  in  the  British  Isles.  \t 
also  occurs  earlier  than  with  us — so  early  as  the  end  of  March, — so  that 
possibly  in  the  Hi  valley  there  are  three  or  more  broods  m  the  course 
of  the  twelve  months.  The  Large  Blue  [Lyccsna  Arton)^  that  scarce 
English  butterfly  (all  but  extinct,  except  at  Bolt  Head,  Devon),  is  of

April.  I  am  indebted  for  these  comparisons  between  the  butterflies  of 
Central  Asia  and  of  England  to  the  Rev.  A.  E.  Hodgson.  For  further

SOMEONE  suggested  that  I  should  float  from 
Kuldja  westwards  on  the  Hi,  which  would  have 
been  pleasant  enough  but  for  my  tarantass,  if  one  may 
judge  of  the  velocity  of  the  stream  as  we  saw  it,  and 
which  Mr.  Alpheraky  says  is  three  times  as  rapid  as  the 
Neva  at  Petersburg.  Below  Kuldja  the  river  flows 
through  a  flat  inhabited  country  between  open  banks 
(the  right  steeper  than  the  left),  with  a  wide  and 
copious  stream.  The  banks  are  marshy  and  over- 
grown with  reeds.  These,  when  the  river  is  full,  are 
frequently  submerged,  and  then  there  are  no  fords, 
but  at  other  seasons  there  is  a  ford  at  Old  Kuldja 
2\  feet  deep,  and  another  near  the  ruins  of  Chinese 
Kuldja  2  feet  deep.  The  river  is  frozen  for  about 
60  days,  from  the  end  of  December  to  the  end  of 
February,  but  at  other  times  timber  is  floated  down 


252  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

from  its  upper  to  its  central  course.  The  stream, 
indeed,  is  called  navigable  from  50  miles  above  Kuldja 
to  400  miles  below  it,  where  its  waters  enter  the  Balk- 
hash. 

When  I  was  in  the  Hi  valley  the  Russians  had  not 
succeeded  in  establishing  steam  communication  on 
the  river,  but  since  my  return  I  have  heard  from 
Mr.  Gourdet  that  a  *'  Mr.  P.,"  an  engineer,  is  sanguine 
of  converting  the  Hi  into  a  means  of  commercial  com- 
munication between  Kuldja  and  the  Balkhash,  and 
even  of  passing  through  this  lake  to  the  Irtish  beyond, 
and  so  on  to  Siberia  and  Russia.  To  th^  realization 
of  this  project  a  small  steamer  of  20  tons  was  purchased 
in  England,  and  launched  at  Hisk,  near  Vierny,  in  1883. 
The  first  voyage  was  made  with  a  freight  of  corn,  but 
under  great  difficulties.* 

*  These  difficulties  are  mainly  connected  with  the  channel,  the  bottom 
of  the  river  being  of  shifting  sand,  of  which  Mr.  Gourdet  tells  me  he  has 
himself  seen  small  islands  form  and  disappear  again  in  the  course  of  a  few 
days.    Hence  the  water  is  not  deep  enough  for  craft  drawing  more  than 
two  or  three  feet,  and  although  this  particular  steamer  could  go  against 
stream  12  or  14  knots  an  hour,  it  could  not  sometimes  on  the  Hi  make 
more  than  a  few  miles  in  a  day,  and,  of  course,  had  to  stop  by  night. 
So  that  during  the  whole  season  50  tons  only  were  carried  instead  of 
300,  as  expected.     What  com  was  sold  brought  a  large  profit,  the  cost 
in  Vierny  being  4J.  or  5^.,  the  selling  price  at  Jarkend  on  the  Hi  le^s.  6d. 
and  i8j.  dd.  per  cwt.,  but  this  demand  was  exceptional  and  temporary, 
created  by  the  purchasers  being  Taranchis  and  Dungans,  emigrants 
whose  first  crop  was  not  yet  forthcoming.    The  ordinary  small  exchange 
to  the  annual  value  of  a  few  thousand  pounds  sterling  between  Vierny 
and  Ruldja  is  not  sufficient  to  support  regular  steam  navigation,  whi  h 
must  also  compete  with  land  carriage  by  horses.     Mr.  P.'s  commercial 
prospects  on  the  upper  portion  of  the  river,  therefore,  are  not  promising. 
As  for  the  project  in  the  opposite  direction,  Russian  goods  are   now 
brought  to  Irbit,  thence  up  the  Irtish  to  Semipolatinsk,  and  on  by  horses 
to  Vierny.    Mr.  P.'s  idea  is  to  diminish  this  land  carriage  by  taking  the 
goods  from  Semiyarsk  on  the  Irtish  across  the  Steppe  to  the  Balkhash, 
then  by  steamer  to  Hisk,  and  on  again  by  horses,  which  would  save 
285  miles  by  road,  at  a  cost  of  528  miles  by  water.     This  would  be  a 
doubtful  gain  as  to  time,  and  entail  great  expense.     Besides,  by  the 


FROM  KULDJA    TO  ALTYN-IMMEL.  253 

We  were  invited,  on  our  last  evening  in  Kuldja,  to 
visit  Colonel  Mayevsky,  who  was  living  some  distance 
beyond  the  market-place  in  a  house  that  formerly 
belonged  to  a  Taranchi  bek.  This  title  is  hereditary, 
and  the  young  boy  who  had  succeeded  thereto  was 
introduced  to  us.  The  house,  I  suppose,  might  be 
regarded  as  a  specimen  of  a  rich  native's  dwelling. 
Almost  all  the  native  houses  are  made  of  beaten  clay, 
have  thatched  roofs,  and  are,  externally,  low  and  ugly. 
The  courtyards  are  heaped  up  with  impurities,  and 
even  the  abodes  of  the  well-to-do  display  an  absence 
of  ventilation  and  light;  but  we  had  no  reason  to  com- 
plain on  this  last  score,  for  it  was  dark  before  we 
reached  the  colonel's  dwelling.  We  looked  over  the 
house,  and  perceived  an  attempt  at  ornamentation  of 
the  walls,  the  room  of  our  host  being  adorned  with 
carpets  and  rugs.  We  received,  moreover,  a  hearty 
welcome  from  the  colonel,  who  had  great  regard  for 

old  route  there  are  telegraph  wires ;  the  merchants  can  communicate 
with  their  caravans,  and,  in  case  of  anything  going  wrong,  provide  for 
its  reparation  ;  but  by  the  proposed  route  the  owners  would  lose  sight 
of  their  goods  for  six  or  eight  weeks,  as  well  as  increase  their  risks 
by  navigating  the  uncertain  and  sometimes  stormy  Balkhash.  Mr.  P. 
has  another  scheme,  Mr.  Gourdet  tells  me,  to  bring  the  goods  from 
Irbit  all  across  the  desert  through  Akmolinsk  to  the  Balkhash,  which 
looks  still  less  feasible,  though  in  January,  1884,  he  had  started  for 
England  to  buy  a  lake  steamer  and  iron  to  construct  barges.  In 
September,  1883,  ^^'  P-  explored  the  Lower  Hi,  taking  a  month  for  a 
voyage  of  500  miles,  experiencing  similar  difficulties  to  those  found  on 
the  upper  waters  of  the  river,  one  of  the  drawbacks  being  want  of  fuel ; 
for  though  coal  abounds  in  the  valley  away  from  the  river,  the  Russians 
continue  to  use  wood  for  fuel,  and  this  has  to  be  brought  to  the  river 
banks  at  considerable  cost.  One  more  difficulty  to  be  surmounted  is  that 
a  screw  steamer  with  a  keel  is  found  less  suitable  for  the  shallow  Hi 
than  would  be  a  flat  bottom  with  paddles,  and  to  make  such  alterations 
to  a  boat  in  the  heart  of  Asia  can  only  be  done  at  great  expense ;  but 
it  is  interesting  to  see  the  effort  of  Mr.  P.  for  opening  up  the  country, 
and  one  can  but  hope  that  the  result  may  prove  more  satisfactory  than 
it  now  appears. 


254  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

the  English,  speaking  of  them  as  rivals  in  Asia,  though 
not  as  foes.  He  allowed  that  our  infantry  were  better 
than  theirs,  but  thought  the  Russian  cavalry  better 
than  the  English.  He  spoke,  too,  regretfully  of 
having  to  cede  the  province  to  the  Chinese,  for  it 
made  so  excellent  a  frontier,  and  alluded  to  the  delicate 
position  in  which  the  Russians  were  placed  with  regard 
to  the  natives  of  Kuldja,  who  preferred  the  Tsar's  rule 
to  that  of  their  old  masters  the  Chinese.* 

When  it  was  decided  that  Kuldja  should  be  given 
back  to  the  Chinese,  the  inhabitants  were  told  that 
they  might  remain  or  cross  the  border  into  Russian 
territory.  When  I  was  there,  less  than  a  year  before 
the  evacuation,  numbers  of  the  inhabitants  were  already 
gone  ;  and  to  show  that  their  hatred  of  the  Chinese  was 
not  subsided,  I  may  add  that,  after  taking  everything 
out  of  their  houses  that  was  of  value,  they  set  fire  to 
the  remainder,  so  that  their  former  masters,  on  taking 
possession,  should  find  as  little  as  possible  to  appro- 
priate.    One  report,  probably  exaggerated,   said   that 

♦  The  preference  for  Russian  rule  of  the  Muhammadan  inhabitants, 
whatever  may  have  been  the  case  with  the  Buddhists,  was,  I  believe, 
undoubtedly  true,  which  need  create  little  surprise,  for,  if  Kostenko 
may  be  believed,  the  Chinese  Government  and  officials  of  old  were  wont 
to  show  their  intellectual  superiority  over  the  Westerns  in  a  very 
haughty  and  conceited  manner,  burdening  them,  moreover,  with  various 
imposts.  Besides  this  the  Hi  inhabitants  were  obliged  to  maintain  the 
numerous  herds  of  the  Bogdi-Khan,  or  Chinese  Emperor,  and  the 
property  of  the  people  was  never  safe.  If  any  article  pleased  a  Chinese 
official  he  would  take  it  without  parley,  and  it  was  the  same  thing  ii 
the  wife  or  daughter  of  a  Dungan  or  Taranchi  pleased  him.  In  addi- 
tion to  this  the  people  were  subjected  to  many  galling  humiliations. 
On  meeting  a  Chinese,  a  native  of  the  country  was  obliged  to  rise  if 
sitting,  or  to  dismount  if  riding.  It  was  a  course  of  such  offences, 
humiliations,  and  insults,  that  at  last  exhausted  all  patience,  and  made 
the  people  rebel.  Then  it  was  the  Russians  stepped  in  and  took 
possession  of  the  land  on  behalf  of  the  Chinese,  who,  when  they  had 
re-established  their  power  in  Kashgar,  called  upon  the  Russians  to 
restore  to  them  Kuldja.     The  Chinese  ambassador  went  to  Petersburg

nine-tenths  of  the  people  were  leaving.  Meanwhile 
the  Chinese  were  doing  their  best  to  prevent  this 
wholesale  emigration  by  promising  greater  liberty  and 
freedom  from  taxes  for  ten  years.  Such  persuasion 
they  could  not  attempt,  of  course,  openly,  but  we  heard 
that  when  possible  they  had  recourse  to  coercion,  way- 
laying and  maltreating  the  emigrants.  I  suspect  it 
was  something  of  this  kind  that  hindered  our  starting 
at  midnight,  as  I  intended  on  the  evening  we  saw 
Colonel  Mayevsky.  At  his  house  we  met  the  assistant 
to  the  Uyezdi  nachalnik,  and  he  kindly  arranged  for 
us  about  post-horses,  but  the  authorities  sent  to  say 
that  night  travel  was  not  safe,  and  advised  us  to 
wait  until  morning.  Only  the  night  before,  they  said, 
some  travellers  had  been  waylaid  and  an  ox  killed, 
but  I  did  not  learn  whether  it  was  a  case  of  high- 
way robbery  or  of  Chinese  intimidation.  Nothing  was 
said  of  danger  on  the  post-road  from  beasts  of  prey, 

to  negotiate  the  points  in  dispute,  and  the  terms  he  agreed  to  were 
these  : — The  Russians  offered  to  restore  Kuldja  on  condition  that  China 
defrayed  the  cost  of  the  war  in  which  they  had  assisted  them,  and  gave 
also  certain  commercial  privileges.  But  when  the  ambassador  returned 
to  Peking  he  was  thrown  into  prison  for  having  made  concessions  that , 
were  considered  derogatory  to  the  dignity  of  Chiba.  I  heard  the 
Russians  had  massed  in  Kuldja  15,000  men  at  the  time  war  was  on 
the  point  of  being  declared. 

War  was  happily  averted,  but  to  show  how  little  the  natives  wished 
for  a  recurrence  of  Chinese  rule,  I  may  mention  that  when  the  valley 
of  the  Borotal,  which  at  first,  under  the  Russians,  formed  the  third 
portion  of  the  Kuldja  rayon^  was  handed  back  to  the  Chinese,  and  when 
the  rumour  spread  that  Kuldja  was  also  to  be  ceded,  the  Dungans  and 
Taranchis  came  in  crowds  to  General  Kolpakovsky  in  1877,  handing  in 
memorials  from  both  the  inhabitants  of  Kuldja  and  the  surrounding 
villages,  expressing  their  unanimous  desire  to  remain  under  Russian 
rule.  The  General  gave  them  to  understand  that  the  matter  depended 
upon  the  will  of  the  Emperor,  that  Russia  would  keep  watch  over  the 
proceedings  of  the  Chinese,  and  protect  the  inhabitants  from  all  violence, 
and  he  added  that  those  who  desired  to  emigrate  would  receive  plots  of 
land  within  the  limits  of  Russian  Turkistan. 


FROM  KULDJA    TO  ALTYN-IMMEL,  257 

though  M.  Alpheraky,  further  up  the  valley,  lost  two 
horses  by  tigers,  which  kept  uncomfortably  near  the 
party,  and  some  idea  of  the  number  of  beasts  of  prey 
in  the  country  may  be  gathered  from  the  fact  that  in 
the  southern  portion  of  the  province  in  1877  the  wolves 
killed  7  camels,  657  horses,  249  horned  cattle,  and 
nearly  8,000  sheep. 

We  drove  out  of  Kuldja  at  half-past  five  on  Tuesday 
morning,  and  thus  had  the  opportunity  of  seeing 
certain  parts  of  the  country  by  day  through  which  we 
had  come  by  night.  We  passed  through  fields  and 
gardens,  wherein  are  grown,  besides  the  crops  I  have 
mentioned,  peas  and  Indian  corn,  also  pumpkins, 
carrots,  turnips,  radishes,  beet,  cabbage,  and  garlic, 
but  not  potatoes,  unless  it  be  for  Russian  consump- 
tion.* 

After  a  drive  of  some  hours  over  a  bad  road,  we 
arrived  before  noon  at  the  residence  of  the  Chinese 
Governor-General,  Tsin-Tsiang  Tsiun  (the  last  word 
being  his  name,  and  the  former  two  his  title),  at 
Suidun,  which  was  more  distinctly  Chinese  than 
Kuldja,  for  that  was  under  the  Russian  authorities, 
but  here  was  established  the  authority  of  the  Tsin- 
Tsiang.  In  speaking  of  the  **  Chinese,"  it  should  be 
remembered  that  this  term  in  the  Hi  valley  includes 
three  classes  of  people,  all  differing  in  language,  abili- 
ties, and  character.     There  are  the  Manchus,  who  hold 

*  R6clus  mentions  that  the  cultivation  of  the  poppy  has  been 
authorized  since  1878,  and  quotes  from  the  Turkistan  Gazette  of  1880 
the  area  under  cultivation  in  1874  as  7,650  acres,  and  the  value  of  the 
opium  exported  from  the  Kuldja  territory  into  the  Chinese  Empire  as 
;^33»235.  The  poppy  fields  extend  from  Suidun  up  the  valley  to  the 
confluence  of  the  Kash  with  the  Hi,  but  I  presume  there  must  be  some 
restriction  upon  the  manufacture  of  the  drug,  since  I  found  its  iinporta- 
tion  into  Ferghana  prohibited,  and  a  stick  or  two  of  opium  were  given 
me,  that  had  been  seized  as  contraband.

official  posts,  and  were  formerly  the  representatives  in 
the  Hi  valley  of  the  Celestial  Empire.  They  wear 
dark-blue  coats,  with  other  raiment  of  yellow  and  pink, 
or,  as  some  prefer,  black  and  blue.  Next  are  the 
Khambi,  who  came,  about  3,000  strong,  from  the 
south-eastern  provinces  of  China,  and  were,  for  the 
most  part,  labourers  and  soldiers.  And  lastly,  the 
Tchampani,  criminals  exiled  from  Southern  China, 
who,  after  a  term  of  hard  labour,  got  their  living  as 
best  they  could,  only  that  in  time  of  war  they  had  to 
serve  in  the  infantry.  All  of  these  three  classes  suffered 
terribly  in  the  rebellion,  and  a  few  only  were  left,  those 
living  more  especially  in  Suidun,  which  was  the  only 
large  town  in  the  province  that  outlived  the  events  of 
T  863-66 ;  but  others  had  come  since  the  promise  of 
the  retrocession  of  Kuldja,  and  more  were  expected  in 
such  numbers  that  I  heard  of  a  Russian  officer  purchas- 
ing house  property  in  Kuldja  with  a  view  of  selling  it  at 
a  premium.  From  a  letter  I  have  received,  however, 
I  gather  that  things  have  again  become  prosperous 
and  thoroughly  Chinese,  but  that  the  Russian  houses 
are  standing  empty. 

I  had  looked  forward,  with  some  degree  of  curious 
interest,  to  the  presentation  of  my  credentials  from 
the  Legation  in  London  to  the  Chinese  Governor 
at  Suidun.*  The  Russian  post-house  is  in  the 
suburbs,  and  not  wishing  to  take  up  our  heavy 
tarantass,  we  had  driven  into  the  town  in  another 
vehicle,  that  we  could  dismiss,  and    on   reaching  the 

*  According  to  my  statistics  for  1878,  Suidun  had  1,260  houses,  with 
a  population  of  2,700  males  and  2,300  females.  Of  these  4,300  were 
Dungans,  and  700  Chinese.  Divided  according  to  classes,  there  were 
18  clerics,  95  merchants,  31  mechanics,  4,400  farmers,  and  about  500 
labourers  ;  but  these  represent  the  town  under  Russian  government. 
There  must  since  have  been  added  several  Chinese  ;*uthorities.

principal  street,  I  sent  my  card  to  the  Governor- 
General.  We  were  asked  to  stay  where  we  were,  and 
having  done  so  for  some  minutes,  the  messenger  came 
back  to  say  that  his  Excellency  was  changing  his  robes, 
and   had   summoned   his   officers  of  state.     We  then 

went  down  a  narrow  street,  and  were  shown  into  an 

* 

entrance  chamber  with  many  attendants,  the  walls 
being  hung  with  English  and  American  muskets, 
rusty,  old,  and  apparently  worthless.  Dr.  Schuyler 
said  the  walls  of  Suidun  were  wide  enough  at  the  top 
to  serve  for  a  carriage  road,  and,  as  we  approached  the 
town,  labourers  were  increasing  their  thickness ;  but 
with  such  arms  within,  the  Russians  might  well  laugh, 
as  one  officer  did,  saying  that  a  company  of  their 
Cossacks  would  set  the  Chinese  flying. 

Whilst  waiting,  I  changed  my  dress  for  the  occasion, 
and,  when  all  was  ready,  crossed  a  yard  to  enter  a 
square  court.  At  the  opposite  side  stood  the  great 
man,  whilst  on  the  right  and  left  were  men  drawn  up 
in  martial  array.  The  effect  was  meant,  no  doubt,  to  be 
imposing,  and  it  certainly  was  curious.  My  host  saluted 
me  by  lifting  his  hands  in  a  '* lullaby-baby"  fashion, 
and  then  took  us  within,  and  invited  us  to  be  seated 
on  two  sides  of  a  table,  about  3  feet  square,  whilst 
he  occupied  a  third.  Opposite  the  Tsin-Tsiang,  on  a 
table,  was  the  Government  seal  of  office,  wrapped  in 
yellow  material,  together  with  a  scroll  containing  his 
credentials.  His  officers,  twelve  in  number,  with 
various  orders  and  feathers,  stood  behind  him,  perfectly 
silent,  one  of  them  fanning  presumptuous  flies  from  the 
grand  man's  head.  On  the  table  were  plates  with 
slices  of  apple,  grapes,  wafers,  and  some  honeyed  cakes, 
made  apparently  of  the  seed  from  which  oil  had  been 
pressed,  and  such  as  we  saw,  but  were  not  delighted 


26o  RUSSIAX  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

with,  at  the  Kuldja  oil  factory.  Our  host  then  pro- 
ceeded gravely  to  help  us  with  his  fingers,  placing  the 
eatables  a  few  at  a  time  on  our  plates,  first  wafers,  then 
grapes,  apples,  and  cakes.  At  the  same  time  was 
brought  tea  of  a  strong  jasmine  flavour,  called  red, 
but  pale  and  highly  aromatic. 

Tea  was  put  into  each  cup,  water  poured  thereon, 
and  covered  with  an  inverted  saucer,  a  little  smaller 
than  the  rim  of  the  cup,  and,  consequently,  keeping  in 
the  steam.  This  was  well  enough,  but  now  came  a 
feat  of  manipulation,  for  the  cup  had  no  handle,  but 
had  to  be  held  with  the  fingers,  whilst  the  thumb  was 
left  free  to  tilt  the  saucer  into  the  beverage,  in  such  a 
way  as  in  drinking  to  hold  back  the  floating  leaves 
from  entering  the  mouth.  We  succeeded  pretty  well, 
and  I  expressed  admiration  for  his  tea,  which  remark 
bore  fruit,  as  will  presently  be  seen. 

He  soon  opened  fire  upon  me  by  asking,  in  a  stereo- 
typed manner,  who  I  was,  and  whence  and  how  I  had 
come.  I  at  once  showed  him  my  map,  and  put  to 
the  test  his  Chinese  geography.  He  asked  whether 
Turkey  was  north  or  south  of  England,  and  how  far, 
respectively,  from  London  were  Paris,  Berlin,  and 
Constantinople.  He  inquired  how  long  I  had  been 
travelling,  and  whether  I  had  left  the  Marquis  Tseng 
in  London,  to  which  1  replied  that  he  had  sent  me  my 
letter  from  Paris.  I  invited  him  to  ask  further  ques- 
tions, whereupon  he  inquired  of  what  our  daily  food  in 
England  consisted.  When  my  host  had  finished  his 
queries,  I  began  by  asking  if  it  were  likely  we  should 
have  the  pleasure  of  seeing  him  in  London.  That 
depended,  he  said,  entirely  upon  the  Chinese  Govern- 
ment, as  to  whether  they  chose  to  send  him  ;  but  he 
did  not  expect  it.     \  assured  him  that  we  should  have 


FROM  KULDJA    TO  ALTYN-IMMEL.  261 

a  great  many  strange  things  to  show  him,  and  inquired 
how  soon  he  thought  they  would  have  railways  in 
China.  He  thought  *'  not  at  all "  ;  for  that  in  one 
instance  where  they  had  laid  down  a  line,  they  had, 
after  trial,  taken  it  up  again ! 

This  I  thought  was  *'  progress  "  with  a  vengeance, 
and  I  expressed  my  surprise.  Meanwhile,  after  drink- 
ing tea,  his  Excellency  began  to  smoke  a  pipe,  drawing 
the  cloud  through  water  placed  at  the  bottom  of  the 
bowl,  which  he  did  not  hold  continually  in  his  hand, 
but  took  one  long,  long  whiff,  and  then  the  bowl  was 
emptied  of  tobacco,  and  taken  away  by  an  attendant 
until  called  for  again.  This  suggested  my  asking  him 
if  the  smoking  of  opium  were  general  among  the 
Chinese.  He  replied  that  many  practised  it,  and 
when  I  expressed  a  fear  that  it  was  working  evil  in 
China,  he  replied  that  it  was  against  the  law,  the 
penalty  for  breaking  which  was  to  have  ones 
tongue  cut.  I  fancy,  however,  this  was  said  with 
a  wink,  for  in  Kuldja  (under  the  Russians,  it  is  true) 
I  saw  men  smoking  opium  publicly,  and  the  materials 
for  opium-smoking  appeared  easily  obtainable. 

I  then  offered  him  a  Chinese  Bible  and  a  Mongolian 
and  a  Buriat  New  Testament,  which  he  accepted,  after 
inquiring  what  they  were.  From  the  manner,  however, 
in  which  he  looked  at  them,  I  fancy  he  was  a 
Manchu.  After  the  gushing  reception  my  Petersburg 
letters  had  secured  me  at  the  hands  of  the  Russian 
governors,  I  had  thought,  perhaps,  this  good  man 
would  be  at  the  pains  to  ask  if  he  could  do  any- 
thing for  me,  or  show  me  anything,  especially  as  he 
said  he  had  received  official  notice  from  London  of 
my  coming.  But  he  seemed  not  to  dream  of  such 
a  thing,    nor   to   get   his   official    temperature   above 


262  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

freezing  point,  so  that  our  conversation  became  some- 
what dull,  especially  as  what  I  said  in  English  had  to 
be  twice  translated  into  Russian  and  Chinese  or 
Manchu,  and  vice  vexsd.  It  gave  time,  however,  for 
meditation  between  the  questions,  and  presently  finding 
that  he  had  nothing  to  propose  for  my  pleasure  or 
instruction,  I  asked  whether  I  might  go  and  see  the 
men  building  the  fortress,  and  also  visit  the  bazaar. 
The  first  of  these  trifling  requests  he  refused,  saying 
that  there  were  workmen  about,  and  disagreements 
might  arise.  He  asked  me,  therefore,  not  to  go,  but 
said  he  would  send  someone  with  me  to  the  bazaar. 

We  then  rose  after  this  formal  reception,  and  were 
dismissed  with  the  same  ceremony  as  when  we  came  in, 
and  taken  again  to  the  antechamber.  Here  I  offered 
some  Scriptures  to  the  attendants,  but  they  said  they 
did  not  dare  take  them  without  permission. 

One  of  the  first  things  that  attracted  my  attention 
in  the  bazaar  was  a  street  painter,  whose  pencil 
explained  to  me  the  want  of  perspective,  apparent  in  a 
certain  class  of  Chinese  paintings  ;  for  the  man  simply 
dipped  the  tip  of  his  finger  in  Indian  ink,  and  rubbed 
it  round  and  round  on  the  tablet  till  he  made  his  picture, 
and  only  then  touched  it  up  with  a  brush,  after  seeing 
which  I  marvelled  not,  as  I  had  hitherto  done,  at  the 
clumsiness  of  the  production,  but  that  in  such  a  manner, 
and  so  rapidly,  the  artist  should  have  been  able  to  pro- 
duce anything  so  good.  I  noticed  on  the  stalls  packets 
of  English  needles,  and  found  a  few  curiosities  to  buy ; 
and  then,  thinking  that  I  should  perhaps  get  on  better 
alone  in  distributing  my  few  remaining  Scriptures,  I 
intimated  to  our  cicerone  that  I  need  not  trouble  him 
further.  But  he  said  the  Governor  had  told  him  not 
to   leave    me,    so    that    he    was   probably   a   spy.      I 


PROM  KULDJA    TO  ALTYN-JMMEL.  263 

managed,  however,  to  give  a  few  Chinese  and  Mon- 
golian books,  and  then  prepared  to  return  to  the 
post-house. 

To  this  end  we  chartered  a  native  conveyance,  the 
most  uncomfortable  of  its  kind,  without  exception,  I 
ever  entered ;  a  two-wheeled  cart,  without  springs  or 
seat,  and  with  an  awning,  against  which  one's  head 
was  constantly  in  danger  of  striking.  It  served  us, 
however,  to  the  post-station,  and  we  were  driving  out 


of  the  town  when  a  Chinese  officer  and  interpreter  came 
dashing  up  to  our  carriage,  one  of  them  carrying  two 
small  canisters  of  tea,  and  saying  that  since  I  had  so 
appreciated  the  Governor's  tea,  he  sent  me  two  canisters 
for  a  present.  His  Excellency  had  apparently  thawed 
a  little  since  our  visit,  or  if  he  had  suspected  me  as  a 
spy,  he  seemed  to  have  by  this  time  changed  his  mind. 
Anyhow  I  thanked  him  for  his  gift,  but  was  at  first 
inclined  to  look  thereon  as  "a  white  elephant,"  for  I 
hardly   relished   the  trouble  of  carrying  two  canisters 


264  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

of  tea  a  distance  home  of  5,000  miles.  When  I 
reached  Vierny,  however,  I  was  told  that  this  yellow 
tea  was  of  so  choice  a  kind  that  it  is  reserved  in 
China  for  the  Emperor  and  great  personages;  that 
now  and  then  Chinese  generals  sold  it  to  Russian 
officers,  and  that  its  value  was  about  50^.  per  lb., 
whereupon  I  was  reconciled  to  bringing  it  to  England, 
but  only  to  give  to  my  friends  in  small  quantities 
as  a  curiosity,  for  my  poor  taste  is  not  sufficiently 
educated  a  la  Chinoise  to  appreciate  its  super-excellence. 

We  reached  Chinchakhodzi  by  night,  and  found 
the  one  room  of  the  post-station  occupied  by  a  doctor. 
We  were  recommended  not  to  proceed  in  the  dark, 
as  the  road  was  bad,  but  to  wait  for  the  rising  of  the 
moon,  which  I  did,  our  company  being  soon  increased 
by  an  officer,  his  wife,  wet-nurse  and  a  baby ;  so  that, 
rather  than  attempt  going  to  sleep,  I  sat  up  reading  and 
writing,  and  soon  after  midnight  we  sped  forward.  Early 
in  the  morning  we  crossed  the  two  or  three  streams  of 
the  Khorgos,  and  breakfasted  at  Ak-Kent.  The  next 
station  was  Jar-Kend,  that  has  now  become  colonized 
by  Dungans  and  Taranchis  who  have  left  the  Kuldja 
province  to  be  under  the  Russians,  rather  than  remain 
there  to  be  subject  to  the  Chinese.  A  wealthy  Taran- 
chi,  who  joined  Mr.  P.  in  the  steam  navigation  project 
of  the  Hi,  has  removed  from  Kuldja  to  this  place,  and  it 
is  here  that  corn  had  to  be  brought,  in  1883,  to  supply 
their  immediate  wants ;  but  M.  Gourdet  tells  me  that 
now  the  emigrants  are  quite  settled  on  their  new  lands, 
and  have  so  finished  their  irrigation  works  that  it  is 
expected  wheat  will  be  cheaper  in  this  neighbourhood 
than  at  Vierny. 

We  came  next  to  Borokhudzir.    We  had  succeeded 
well  aboiit  horses  thus  far,  but,  to  make  matters  still 


FROM  KULDJA    TO  ALTYN-IMMEL.  265 

better,  we  found  awaiting  us  here,  on  the  frontier  of 
the  uyezd,  the  secretary  of  the  Uyezdi  nachalnik,  who, 
through  General  Kolpakovsky's  kindness,  had  actually 
come  all  the  way  from  Kopal  to  accompany  us  for  the 
purpose  of  seeing  that  we  were  not  delayed  through 
lack  of  horses.  An  instance  of  greater  official  kind- 
ness than  this  I  had  never  met.  The  secretary  took 
us  over  the  nursery  garden  in  the  place,  and  we  then 
started  forward,  our  cicerone  preceding  us  a  little  so 
as  to  get  to  the  next  station  first,  and  have  fresh  horses 
in  readiness.  The  same  evening,  at  Konor-Ulen,  we 
came  again  to  the  station  where  was  the  sick  tele- 
graphist, whose  kindness  to  us  we  returned  by  leaving 
him  some  fruit.  Mr.  Sevier  attended  again  to  the 
Tatar's  tongue,  who  asked  this  time  what  were  the 
books  we  had  sold  him,  for  he  could  not  understand 
them.  After  this  we  reached  the  steep  incline  of 
the  pass,  up  which  we  had  six  horses  to  drag  us, 
before  descending  to  the  station  beyond.

IT  was  early  on  the  morning  of  the  7th  September 
when  from  Kuldja  we  arrived  at  Altyn-Immel. 
The  bulk  of  my  books  had  greatly  shrunk,  for  every- 
where the  post-masters  and  others  purchased  them 
readily.  Accordingly,  our  boxes  repacked,  we  started 
for  Vierny.  Altyn-Immel  station  is  4,000  feet  high, 
and  in  four  stages  we  were  to  descend  2,700  feet  to 
the  Hi  river.  Our  road  lay  over  the  round-backed 
spurs  of  the  Chulak  hills,  and  after  the  second  station, 
Karachekinsk,  across  immense  plains,  dotted  here  and 
there  with  Kirghese  yourts,  and  herds.  At  Chingil- 
dinsk,  the  next  station,  was  a  spring  of  water,  roofed 
over  in  the  post-house,  that  I  was  taken  to  see  as 
something  remarkable, — a  veritable  treasure,  I  suppose, 
in  such  a  region. 

Here  we  drank  tea,  and  posted  on  to  Ilisk,  defended 


FROM  ALTYN-IMMEL   TO   VIERNY.  267 

by  a  small  fort,  and  where  a  ferry  took  us  across  the 
Hi,  here  about  700  feet  wide.  Future  travellers  will  be 
able  to  cross  by  a  bridge.  It  was  to  be  opened  in  the 
spring  of  1884,  as  Major  Gourdet  wrote  me,  a  wood 
and  iron  one  built  on  the  American  Howe  system,  850 
feet  long,  at  a  cost  of  about  ;^20,ooo.  M.  Gourdet 
had  been  sent  to  Europe  to  order  the  ironwork  of  the 
structure  when  I  met  him  at  Moscow.*  At  this  river 
our  official  companion  reached  the  frontier  of  his  uyezd, 
and  having  now  conducted  us  rapidly,  and  shown  us 
every  attention  possible,  he  bade  us  adieu.  Mean- 
while, we  pushed  on  to  Kuntenta,  after  passing  which 
I  learned  the  use  of  sending  on  the  wagonette  ahead. 
I  had  insisted  on  this  after  our  former  mishap  ;  and 
at  about  two  o'clock  on  the  morning  of  the  8th  we 
overtook  our  vehicle,  out  in  the  cold,  come  to  an  utter 
standstill,  one  of  the  wheels  having  gone  not  a  little 
wrong,  but  having  fallen  entirely  to  pieces.  We  could 
only  trot  forward  in  the  tarantass  to  the  next  station, 
Kara-su,  where  the  good-natured  post-master  lent  us  a 
wheel  to  recover  the  broken-down  vehicle,  and  allowed 

♦  The  weight  of  iron  is  130  tons,  and  consists  of  160  tubular  pillars 
and  7,000  bolts.  M.  Gourdet  mentions  an  interesting  fact  about  the 
metal — namely,  that  a  rod  of  iron  of  120  inches,  with  a  section  of 
I  square  inch,  supported  an  elongation  of  12  inches  before  breaking 
under  a  weight  of  25  tons  ;  to  which  should  be  added,  that  on  account 
of  the  testing  machine  being  a  very  primitive  one,  the  tension  was  not 
made  in  the  plane  of  the  axis  of  the  bolt,  so  that  it  w^as  before  breaking 
bent  at  an  angle  of  about  15°.  It  was  just  at  the  bend  that  the  bolt 
broke,  showing  that,  if  the  tension  had  been  quite  vertical,  it  would  have 
borne  more  than  25  tons  weight.  The  pillars  are  made  of  f-inch  sheet- 
iron,  the  quality  of  which  may  be  estimated  from  one  of  the  sheets 
having  been  folded,  cold,  like  a  piece  of  paper,  i.e.,  at  180**,  without  the 
least  sign  of  cracking.  Holes  i  inch  in  diameter  have  been  punched  at 
a  distance  of  \  of  an  inch  from  one  another,  and  the  narrow  partition  is 
left  quite  clean  and  entire,  without  any  trace  of  breaking.  M.  Gourdet 
then  adds,  "I  do  not  suppose  there  is  much  iron  even  in  England  that 
can  rival  this  from  Nijni  Tagil."

US  to  take  it  on  loan  to  our  destination.  When  I 
offered  this  man  books,  he  inquired  whether  he  was 
obliged  to  purchase  them.  He  did  so,  however,  upon 
being  assured  that  he  was  a  perfectly  free  agent. 

We  now  set  off  on  our  last  stage  across  plains,  from 
which  we  could  see  Vierny  a  long,  long  way  distant 
among  trees,  and  behind  it,  rising  in  majestic  grandeur, 
the  snowy  peaks  of  the  Trans-Ili  or  southern  Ala-Tau, 
This  range  consists  of  two  long,  high,  and  parallel 
chains.     The    northern,    of  which    we    had    a    good 


distant  view  as  we  drove  along  the  plains,  presents 
an  uninterrupted  mountain  mass,  rising  to  an  average 
height  of  8.600  feet,  and  in  its  central  portion  to  the 
limits  of  perpetual  snow,  but  falling  somewhat  lower  at 
either  extremity,  and,  finally,  in  its  eastern  section, 
broken  by  the  gorge  of  the  River  Chilik,  and  afterwards 
by  the  Charin.  Tal-Cheku,  the  highest  peak,  has  an 
elevation  about  equal  to  that  of  Mont  Blanc,  and 
its  snows  are  visible  for  more  than  30  miles  ;  and, 
in  addition,  we  could  see  many  heights  with  snowy 
patches,  fully  entitling  the  range  to  its  name  Ala-Tau 


FROM  ALTYN'IMMEL   TO   VIERNY,  269 

or  the  spotted  mountain.  The  porphyritic  forelands 
are  small  in  comparison  with  the  height  of  the  ridge 
itself. 

Until  comparatively  recently,  not  only  the  slopes, 
but  also  the  lower  spurs  of  these  mountains  were 
covered  with  thick  forests.  Now  grass  alone 
grows  on  the  summits,  and  the  clear,  bright  emerald 
green  of  this  mingles  with  the  dark  green  of  the 
few  fir-trees  that  remain  on  the  hill-tops.  Rain 
often  falls  in  the  mountains,  causing  them  to  be 
veiled  in  dark  mists,  which,  as  they  rise  upwards, 
become  whiter,  taking  all  manner  of  quaint  and 
fantastic  forms,  and  finally  melt  away.  The  spectacle 
presented  by  the  lower  spurs  in  spring,  as  described 
by  both  Kostenko  and  Morgan,  is  said  to  be  very 
beautiful ;  especially  the  Almatinka  valley  when  its 
apple-trees  are  white  with  blossom,  mingling  with  the 
delicate  pink  of  the  apricot  bloom.  At  this  season, 
moreover,  the  nomads  set  fire  to  the  old  grass  in 
order  to  help  the  growth  of  the  new,  and  the  heavens 
become  red  with  the  glow  of  the  flames,  filling  the 
neighbourhood  with  waves  of  light.  Later  on,  the 
steep  declivities,  clothed  with  luxuriant  grass,  are 
stained  with  dark-red  beds  of  pseonies,  and  from  the 
ground,  coloured  with  purple  and  lilac  irises,  shoot  up 
tall  flower-stalks  of  lilies  and  hollyhocks.  This  chain 
is  crossed  by  five  passes,  of  which  three  are  higher 
than  the  Stelvio,  the  highest  in  Europe,  the  most 
elevated  being  that  of  Almata  at  10,900  feet,  from 
which  there  opens  to  the  traveller  s  view  the  southern 
chain  of  the  Ala-Tau,  with  an  average  height  of  8,825 
feet. 

Between  the  low  portions  of  the  northern  and 
southern    ranges,    north    of    the    Chilik    extends   the 


270  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Jelanash  plateau,  5,3CX)  feet  high.*  In  the  Ala-Tau 
mountains  fir-trees  are  most  abundant;  then,  in  lesser 
quantities,  apple,  apricot,  j'tday  ash,  juniper,  and  birch. 
Here,  then,  are  materials  to  justify  the  remark  of 
Kostenko,  that  however  beautiful  are  the  Ala-Tau 
mountains  as  seen  from  the  plains,  the  scene  in  the 
mountains  themselves  is  yet  grander  and  more  strik- 
ing. The  luxuriant  growth  in  the  valleys  and  gorges, 
the  streams,  as  they  burst  forth  seething  between  their 
rugged  banks,  the  paths  and  tracks  winding  like 
serpents  over  the  precipices,  all  combine  to  form  views 
changing  at  each  step  forward  as  in  a  kaleidoscope, 
and  each  prospect  appearing  more  striking  than  the 
one  preceding  it. 

The  Russians  built  Fort  Vernoe,  changed  afterwards 
to  Vierny,  but  at  first  called  Zailinsky,  in  1854,  on  the 
spot  where  in  the  Middle  Ages  stood  Almata.  This 
place  was  then  known  to  the  whole  trading  world,  and 
was  a  station  on  the  great  road  from  Central  Asia  to 
China.  Fort  Vernoe  was  at  first  the  centre  of  the 
administration  of  the  Ala-Tau  district,  but  subsequently 
became  the  provincial  town  of  Semirechia.  The  oldest 
name  of  the  place  was  derived  from  that  of  a  little 
stream  7  feet  wide  by  6  inches  deep,  the  Almatinka, 
so  called  because  its  mountain  sources  are  thickly 
clothed  with  apple  and  apricot  trees.     The  volume  of 

♦  Judging  by  the  geological  character  of  the  soil,  this  plateau, 
Kostenko  says,  was  at  some  time  an  enclosed  mountain  basin,  which  in  a 
long  period  of  time  was  gradually  filled  up  by  an  accumulation  of  sand, 
mud,  and  pebbles,  all  of  which  formed  a  weakly-cemented  conglomerate  at 
the  bottom  of  the  mountain  lake,  filling  the  basin.  Gradually  increasing 
accumulations  at  last  seem  to  have  raised  the  level  of  the  water  to  such 
an  extent  that  it  broke  through  its  mountain  enclosure,  and  found  an 
exit  where  the  Chilik  and  Charin  now  flow.  The  bed  of  the  lake  then 
formed  the  Jelanash  plateau,  the  soil  of  which  is  so  friable,  and  so  little 
firm,  that  the  rivers  Merke,  Kegen,  and  Kurkara,  that  flow  by  it,  have 
cut  themselves  beds  from  700  to  800  feet  deep. 


FROM  ALTYN'IMMEL   TO   VIERNY,  271 

water  in  the  stream  is  annually  diminishing,  partly 
because  of  the  destruction  of  forests  at  its  source,  and 
partly  because  the  waters  are  diverted  into  canals  for 
irrigation.  Two  other  small  streams  flow  through 
the  town,  and  with  the  Almatinka  empty  themselves 
into  the  Hi.  The  town  lies  at  a  height  of  2,500  feet, 
and  enjoys  a  warm,  healthy  climate.* 

We  had  heard  in  the  north  of  the  delights  of  Vierny, 
and,  as  we  drove  along  the  flat  and  painfully  uniform 
plain,  were  looking  forward  to  our  arrival  with  plea- 
sure. We  reached  the  town  before  midday  on  the 
8th  September,  and  drove  to  Aliken's  Hotel,  where, 
the  best  room  being  engaged,  and  the  remaining  one 
utterly  dirty  and  uninviting,  we  made  off"  to  another 
inn  to  inquire  for  quarters.  Here  we  heard  of  two 
French  gentlemen,  said  to  be  travelling  for  pleasure 
and  sport,  who  had  gone  to  Issik-Kul,  and  for  whom 
the  room  was  retained.  We  were  told  we  might  have 
it  on  condition  of  turning  out  when  the  Frenchmen 

♦  The  summer  heats  rise  to  +  99° "5  in  the  shade.  The  climate,  however, 
is  becoming  severer  every  year,  owing  probably  to  the  loss  of  forests. 
The  average  temperature  in  186 1  was  44° '6,  whilst  the  town  of  Marseilles, 
on  nearly  the  same  parallel,  has  an  average  temperature  of  +57°*42. 
Hence  cherries,  peaches,  and  oranges  ripen  there,  but  do  not  grow  at 
Vierny.  The  vine,  however,  has  been  introduced  with  some  success. 
Apples  ripen  in  the  beginning  of  August,  apricots  in  the  latter  half  of 
June,  and  barley  and  wheat  in  July.  The  prevailing  winds  are  north- 
west and  east.  The  former  comes  from  the  Balkhash,  and  raises  in 
clouds  the  sand  of  the  steppe,  bringing  also  fogs.  The  easterly  wind 
is  more  frequent  in  spring.  In  summer  the  heat  is  scarcely  bearable 
during  the  day,  but  the  proximity  of  the  snow-clad  peaks  ensures  cool 
evenings  and  nights.  The  sudden  changes  of  temperature  give  rise  to 
intermittent  fevers,  that  constitute  the  prevailing  sickness  of  the  place. 
During  the  summer,  bowel  complaints  must  be  added,  caused  by  the 
immoderate  use  of  unripe  fruit,  besides  which  all  kinds  of  filth  and 
impurity  are  either  allowed  to  remain  before  the  houses  or  are  thrown 
into  the  stream.  The  Kalmuks,  many  of  whom  live  in  the  town^and 
neighbourhood,  are  celebrated  for  their  extreme  want]of  cleanliness. 


2^2  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

returned ;  but  as  the  chamber  was  in  painful  proximity 
to  a  billiard-room,  from  the  noise  of  which  it  seemed 
likely  disturbances  might  come,  we  returned  to  the 
previous  hotel,  and  took  the  room  with  the  promise 
that  we  should  very  shortly  move  upstairs  when  the 
occupant  of  the  best  room  departed.  The  establish- 
ment had,  however,  one  good  feature  about  it — a 
Russian  bath,  of  which  we  availed  ourselves  imme- 
diately, and  then  proceeded  to  see  the  town  and  make 
some  calls. 

We  hired  a  droshky  at  the  very  moderate  tariff  of 
^\d,  an  hour,  and  found  that  the  town  straggles  over 
a  wide  area.  There  is  the  station  Almatinka,  forming 
the  old  part  of  the  town,  the  settlement  of  Almatinka, 
the  Tatar  suburb,  and  new  Vierny,  the  last  built  since 
1870,  and  to  which  we  drove  through  straight,  wide, 
and  fairly  level  streets,  bordered  thickly  on  either  side 
of  the  footway  with  double  rows  of  poplars.  The  older 
portions  of  the  town,  regularly  laid  out,  are  entirely 
built  of  red  fir  wood,  whilst  in  the  new  town  are 
several  houses  of  brick,  including  the  Governor's  and 
the  Archbishop's  palaces,  and  the  adjacent  ^»^«aj^,  all 
of  them  designed,  if  I  mistake  not,  by  M.  Gourdet,  a 
French  architect  in  the  Russian  service,  to  whom  I 
have  alluded.  The  Governor's  house,  with  its  offices 
and  gardens,  occupies  a  whole  **  quartal,"  or  square. 
There  is  also  outside  the  town  a  public  garden,  with 
greenhouses  and  flowers,  also  a  pavilion  for  music  and 
dancing,  supper  and  cards.* 

♦  According  to  Kostenko,  there  were  in  Vierny,  in  1863,  only  i  stone 
or  brick  house,  and  766  wooden  ones,  whereas,  in  1871,  there  were  239 
brick  and  1,456  wooden  houses,  of  which,  however,  only  4  brick  and 
9  wooden  domiciles  were  of  two  stories.  Thus,  during  8  years,  the 
number  of  houses  doubled,  and  in  similar  proportion  the  number  of 
inhabitants  increased. 


FROM  ALTYN-IMMEL    TO    VIERNY.  273 

The  great  diversity  of  the  population  is  more  strik 
ing  than  its  numbers,  and  gives  the  streets  a  curious 
appearance,  as  one  sees  Russian  women  driving  in 
carts  full  of  melons,  side  by  side  with  Kalmuks  riding 
on  bullocks,  or  Kirghese  on  camels,  and  bringing 
raspberries,  gathered  from  the  surrounding  hills,  to 
sell,  for  as  much  sometimes  as  6^.  a  day.  I  think  I 
never  met  in  a  public  square  so  many  types  of  coun- 


tenance. Cossacks  predominated — the  original  settlers ; 
then  followed  Little  Russians,  recent  arrivals,  who 
occupy  a  suburb  in  the  south  of  the  city,  and  among 
the  colonists  are  also  a  few  Chuvashi,  Mordvins, 
Cheremises,  and  other  peoples  from  the  Volga.  In 
addition  to  these  were  Tatars ;  Sarts  from  various 
towns  in  Turkistan  and  Kashgaria  ;  Kirghese  who  have 
adopted  a  half-settled  mode  of  life;  Kalmuks,  Dungans, 
and  Taranchis,  who  came  from  Kuldja  after  the

there  are  Jews  and  Chinese,  come  for  purposes  of

By  the  kindness  of  M.  Gourdet  I  had  been  furnished 
at  Moscow  with  an  introduction  to  M.  Vladimir  von 
Ghern,  the  Procurator  Fiscal,  or  examining  magistrate 
at  Vierny,  upon  whom  we  called  on  our  first  afternoon, 
and  received  a  hearty  welcome.  This  gentleman  had 
been  in  Central  Asia  for  some  years,  and  had  taken  an 
intelligent  interest  in  the  people  and  country.     He  was"

One  noticeable  feature  about  the  population  is  the  large  number  of 
males  in  excess  of  females.  In  1871  there  were  for  every  100  men  54 
women.  In  1863,  for  every  loo  men  there  were  only  43  women.  The 
number  of  births  and  deaths  among  the  Russian  population  for  187 1 
was  596  and  483  respectively,  the  excess  of  births  over  deaths  being  in 
the  case  of  tmales  45,  and  of  females  68.  These  are  the  latest  full 
statistics  within  my  reach,  but  according  to  a  census  of  Viemy  and  its 
suburbs,  taken  three  years  before  my  visit,  it  appears  that  the  popula- 
tion of  both  was  found  to  be  14,837,  exclusive  of  the  troops,  and  with 
these  added  the  figures  amounted  to  18,423  souls. 


FROM  ALTYN'IMMEL   TO   VIERNY,  275 

a  collector  of  Chinese  and  other  curiosities,  and  of  ob- 
jects of  natural  history.  He  had  some  Chinese  arrows 
of  state,  jade  ornaments,  and  Chinese  spectacles  of 
stone,  rubies,  and  other  gems.  He  not  only  gave  me 
a  great  deal  of  information,  but  also  presented  me  with 
some  skins  and  skeletons  for  the  British  Museum,  also 
with  an  old  Bokhariot  camel  whip,  made  of  maral  skin, 
woven  over  with  brass  wire  ;  a  Kara-Kirghese  knife 
of  native  manufacture,  and  some  Kirghese  threads, 
called  taramiss,  made  from  the  tendons  of  horses*  legs. 
When,  therefore,  we  had  dined  at  his  house,  and  learnt 
such  particulars  as  we  wished  to  know  concerning  the 
town,  we  returned  to  our  hotel  feeling  somewhat  more 
at  home. 

But  the  so-called  "hotel  "  was  a  sorry  place,  its  staff 
consisting  of  two  men — one  to  sell  spirits  at  the  bar, 
and  the  other,  who  had  been  a  soldier,  to  act  as  waiter, 
chambermaid,  and  factotum.  The  latter  was  of  Jewish 
nationality,  dirty  and  unkempt,  called  hither  and  thither 
by  day,  and  more  than  once  (what  is  very  unusual  in  a 
Jew)  muddled  by  liquor  at  night.  On  one  of  these 
half-drunken  occasions  he  confided  to  us  that  the  hotel 
had  been  built  and  was  owned  by  a  man  who  came  to 
the  place  a  private  soldier,  and  now  possessed  I  know 
not  how  many  thousands  of  roubles,  and  *'the  reason  he 
gets  on  so  well,"  said  he,  **is  because  he  doesn't  gamble 
and  drink";  and  then  he  stammered  out,  **No  more  do 
I,  and  that's  why  he  keeps  me."  Fortunately  for  us 
we  had  found  a  firm  friend  in  M.  von  Ghern,  who 
insisted  upon  our  coming  every  day  to  his  house  to 
dinner,  so  that  the  samovar  with  hot  water,  and  such 
things  as  we  could  purchase  in  the  town,  were  nearly 
all  we  had  to  trouble  our  waiter  for. 

Early  the  next  morni/ig  we  received  a  visit  from 


276  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

M.  Ivan  Ivlampivitch  Pargatchevsky,  a  tea  merchant, 
to  whom  1  had  an  introduction  from,  I  think,  his  former 
employer  at  Kiakhta.     He  seemed  honoured  by  the 
introduction,  and  nothing  could  exceed  the  old  man's 
eagerness  to  do  for  us  all  he  possibly  could.       He 
brought  me  white  bread,  sent  to  an  outlying  village 
to  procure  good  fresh  butter,  not  easily  obtainable  in 
Vierny,  and  so  entered  into  my  scheme  for  the  distri- 
bution of  .the  Scriptures,  that  he  begged  me  to  send 
him  five  pounds'  worth  to  circulate  as  widely  as  possible 
by  sale  at  catalogue  prices!     He  seemed  pleased  to 
meet  one  who  had  been  to  Kiakhta,  and  told  me  he 
was  the  first  to  propose  the  bringing  of  tea  up  the 
Amur,  and    across  the    Trans-Baikal    steppe,  instead 
of  over  the  Mongolian   desert.      Another  mercantile 
friend  whose  acquaintance  we  made  was  a  German 
named  Berg,  whose  cook  had  the  reputation  of  being 
the  best  maker  of  bread  in  the  town,  so  that  the  master 
appeared  before  me  in  the  character  of  a  baker,  though 
his  lawful  calling  was  that  of  a  watchmaker.     I   was 
also  informed    that,   being  a   Lutheran,    he    acted  as 
deputy  for  the  pastor  in  baptizing  Protestant  children. 
We  received  a  visit  likewise  from  the  police-master, 
who  came  to  take  us  to  see  the  prison,  and  afterwards 
to  the  cattle-market,  which  presented  a  lively  appearance 
with    men  for  the  most  part  mounted,  and  talking  I 
know  not  how  many  tongues,  where  also   I   took  the 
prices  of  sundry  animals.     For  camels  they  asked  from 
£S  ^o  £^y  ^^^  ^^^  horses  from  30^.  to  ;^io  each.    Sheep 
were  valued  at  from  7s.  to  10^. ;  a  four-year-old  cow  at 
2^.  ;  and  a  goat  at  5^.  6d.     Greenmeat  for  cattle  sold 
for  4^.  a  small  cartload.       Beef,  I  heard  from  Madame 
von  Ghern,  cost  from  id,  to  i^d.  per  lb.,  mutton  rather 
more,  and  veal  from  ^d.  to  $d.  per  lb.    Chickens  fetched 


FROM  ALTYN'IMMEL   TO   VIERNY,  277 

$d.  each,  and  ducks  i^.  3^.  a  couple.  Ascending  in  the 
scale,  servants  on  board-wages  received  from  los.  to 
12^.  a  month,  and  a  coachman  £1  ^  month,  whilst 
house  rent  was  exceedingly  dear.  So,  again,  for  things 
imported  from  Petersburg,  M.  von  Ghern  considered 
that,  if  they  paid  for  an  article  only  half  as  much  again 
as  it  cost,  it  was  not  dear.*  It  was  a  comfort,  however, 
to  the  Russian  inhabitants,  that  if  they  wanted  goods 
from  Petersburg,  from  which  they  were  distant  3,143 
miles,  they  could  have  them  sent  by  parcels'  post 
at  the  rate  of  9^.  per  pound,  or  by  heavy  transport 
at  the  rate  of  4  J^.  per  pound. 

As  we  approached  Vierny  we  overtook  many  cart- 
loads of  melons  making  their  way  to  the  town,  and  the 
number  of  melons  we  saw  in  the  market  was  surprising. 
M.  von.  Ghern  gave  us  a  water-melon  for  dessert  as 
big  as  the  largest  of  English  pumpkins,  and  he  said 
that  water-melons  had  been  brought  to  the  town 
weighing  as  much  as  36  lbs.  They  have  also  at  Vierny 
a  smooth  melon  raised  from  Kuldja  seed.  Melons  and 
water-melons  are  sold  for  the  moderate  price  of  6s. 
a  hundred,  and  can  be  kept  for  use  up  to  Christmas. 
In  the  market  we  also  bought  grapes,  and,  still  better, 
small  but  luscious  nectarines,  the  latter  for  a  halfpenny 
each,  of  which,  as  I  sat  over  my  writing  at  night,  I  ate

instincts  led  him  to  fear  for  the  consequences.  All 
went  well,  however,  and  I  held  with  him  a  medical 
consultation  as  to  whether  no  ill-effects  having  followed 
from  my  indulgence  was  a  good  or  bad  sign  ;  and  upon 
his  assuring  me  that  it  evidenced  a  good  digestion, 
I  never  stinted  myself  from  that  time  onward  from 
Central  Asian  fruit,  and  I  am  thankful  to  say  was  not 
once  inconvenienced  thereby. 

The  market  was,  of  course,  suggestive  of  the 
occupations  of  the  people,  of  which  the  principal  is 
igriculture.  They  cultivate  spring  and  autumn  rye, 
wheat,  oats,  barley,,  millet,  buckwheat,  and  potatoes. 
The  amount  of  grain  raised  just  serves  for  home 
consumption,  including  that  used  for  making  alcoholic 
drinks,  and  for  what  is  sold  to  the  Kirghese.  After 
agriculture  and  cattle  breeding  may  be  mentioned 
among  the  industries  of  Vierny,  wine  pressing,  distilla- 
tion of  spirits,  tanning,  and  brick-making.  Thanks  to 
the  favourable  position  of  Vierny,  between  roads  lead- 
ing from  Kuldja  to  Tashkend  and  Khokand,  and  from 
Kashgar  to  Semipolatinsk,  its  trade  has  developed  in 
a  remarkable  manner.  In  old  times  caravans  passing 
Vierny  did  not  stop  there,  but  now  they  discharge 
and  take  up  merchandise  for  sale  elsewhere.  Many 
merchants  from  Tashkend  and  other  parts  come  here 
expressly  to  carry  on  a  settled  trade.  There  takes 
place  yearly  a  considerable  trade  in  cattle,  the  animals 
being  purchased  from  the  Kirghese  not  only  to  supply 
Tashkend  and  Kuldja,  but  Petropavlovsk  also,  that  is 
more  than  800  miles  distant.  There  are  at  Vierny  at 
least  two  bazaars  :  the  Russian  one  of  the  ordinary 
type,  and  a  Sart  bazaar  that  we  visited,  as  well  as 
Dungan  and  other  native  eating-houses,  the  delicacies 
in  which  appeared  to  be  pilau  with  rice,  carrots,  and 


FROM  ALTYN'IMMEL   TO   VIERNY,  279 

raisins,  and  small  meat  puddings,  a  farthing  and  a  penny 
each  ;  also  Lasagne  bread  for  soup,  and  upstairs  in  a 
loft  were  small  tables  surrounded  by  mats,  on  which 
the  natives  sat  drinking  tea.  There  were  two  objects 
of  interest  I  was  able  to  secure  in  this  town,  the  one  a 
Dungan  bridle,  and  the  other  a  Kara-Kirghese  leather 
bottle  for  kumiss,  both  of  which  are  now  in  the.  British 
Museum. 

Vierny  is  the  centre  of  administration  for  the  chief 
of  the  Cossacks  and  the  police,  besides  being  the 
residence  of  the  Governor,  who  was  away  on  official 
business  during  our  stay.  We  called  upon  the  Vice- 
Go  vernor,  M.  Aristoff,  who  had  read  of  my  visits  to 
the  prisons  of  Siberia,  and  of  my  distribution  of  the 
Scriptures.  The  latter  met  with  his  hearty  approval, 
and  he  readily  undertook  to  carry  out  my  wishes 
in  the  five  hospitals  and  five  prisons  of  the  province, 
for  which  purpose  I  sent  him,  by  the  police-master,  80 
Scriptures  and  100  other  publications  on  the  following 
day. 

It  is  encouraging  to  see  that  education  has  been 
attended  with  some  success  in  Vierny.  I  think  it 
was  holiday  time  during  my  stay,  but,  according  to 
Kostenko,  there  are  now  in  existence  there  seven 
educational  establishments  *  and  a  library  founded  in 
1878  at  the  Military  Bureau,  of  2,000  volumes,  to 
which,  during  a  period  of  eight  months,  1,474  persons 
were  admitted,  and  to  whom  were  issued  2,749  books. 

There  are  in  Vierny  two  churches  and  a  mosque, 

*  I.  School  at  Almatinka,  with  175  boys  and  39  girls.  2.  Parish 
school  at  Almatinka,  with  45  boys.  3.  A  Mussulman  school  in  the 
Tatar  suburb  with  70  pupils,  under  a  mullah.  4.  An  industrial  school, 
with  21  pupils,  for  learning  trades.  5.  School  of  horticulture,  with  21 
pupils,  under  a  gardener  from  the  Crimea.  6.  An  academy  for  women.

and  the  foundation  of  a  cathedral  is  also  laid.  The 
bulk  of  the  people  are  of  the  orthodox  faith.*  On 
Sunday  afternoon  we  went  to  see  Alexander,  Arch- 
bishop of  Turkistan  and  Tashkend.  Opposite  his 
door  was  a  large  Buddhist  bell.  When  ushered  into 
his  Grace's  reception-room  I  was  fairly  taken  aback 
at  the  furniture,  the  number  of  curiosities  and  pictures, 
and  the  taste  with  which  they  were  arranged.  On 
the  wall  were  Italian  paintings ;  on  the  tables  photo- 
graphic albums  of  Rome,  and  curios  from  the  cata- 
combs and  Prague ;  from  China  and  Japan  coins  and 
talismans,  as  well  as  antiquities  from  Lake  Issik-Kul. 
But  what  was  more  remarkable  for  a  Russian  eccle- 
siastic, there  was  a  good  library,  and  in  it  Bibles  in 
Hebrew,  Greek,  and  Latin — such  a  thing,  I  was  told, 
as  was  possessed  by  no  other  priest  in  Turkistan.  I 
had  been  before  into  the  houses  of  Russian  priests  and 
bishops,  but  had  never  seen  anything  to  equal  this, 
and  the  Archbishop's  story  soon  showed  that  it  was 
due  to  foreign  influence.  His  grace  was  a  widower, 
who,  after  losing  his  wife,  had  become  a  monk,  and 
passed  through  the  academy.  He  had  served  as  priest 
in  Petersburg,  had  been  a  member  of  the  Russian 
Mission  at  Peking,  and  also  chaplain  at  Rome.  With 
great  glee  he  showed  me  some  rare  and  curious  books

against  Popes  and  Romanists  found  on  the  bookstalls 
of  Rome,  and  which  he  regarded  as  spoils  from  the 
Philistine's  camp.  He  spoke  Italian  fluently,  and 
Chinese,  but  French,  unfortunately  for  me,  he  had 
almost  forgotten.  He  had  a  splendid  collection  of 
Central  Asian  photographs,  and  gave  me  some  in  ex- 
change for  others  I  was  to  send  from  England.  These 
have  since  served  me  in  good  stead  for  engravings. 
It  must  not  be  imagined,  however,  that  the  Archbishop 
counted  his  income  by  thousands.  I  was  told  it  did 
not  probably  exceed  ;^300  a  year,  and  very  many  of 
the  things  I  saw  were  presents,  and  the  curios  had 
been  picked  up  in  odd  places  at  comparatively  little 
cost.  I  should  gladly  have  had  much  conversation 
with  him,  especially  about  the  Russian  Church,  con- 
cerning which,  from  having  seen  other  religious 
communities  abroad,  the  Archbishop  could  form  a 
better  estimate  than  many  of  his  confreres.  I  referred 
to  the  sad  lack  of  preaching  therein,  whereupon  he 
mentioned  the  harassing  regulation  that  a  priest  before 
preaching  a  sermon  must  write  and  send  it  for  approval 
to  the  censor,  but  he  thought  it  likely,  nevertheless, 
that  preaching  would  revive  in  the  Russian  Church  ; 
saying  that,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  many  priests  do  now 
expound  the  Gospel  for  the  day  in  the  churches  or  in 
private  houses.  The  old  gentleman  gladly  showed  us 
his  treasures,  and,  had  his  strength  and  our  time  per- 
mitted, he  would  have  entertained  us  longer,  but  we 
had  to  go  to  M.  von  Ghern's,  close  by,  for  our  last 
dinner  at  his  hospitable  board. 

My  host  was  delighted  to  see  the  Kirghese  New 
Testaments  I  had  brought.  He  had  some  doubt, 
however,  as  to  whether  the  translation  was  in  the 
pure  dialect  of  the  people,  though  he  did  not  think 


282  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

they  would  be  unable  to  read  it.  I  afterwards  had 
a  similar  opinion  given  me  by  some  of  the  Kirghese 
themselves,  who  said  it  contained  several  Tatar 
words.* 

I  could  hear  of  no  books  whatever  in  pure  Kir- 
ghese, and  was  told  that  a  translation  of  Scriptures 
and  the  simplest  of  tracts  for  the  Kara- Kirghese, 
estimated  at  upwards  of  250,000,  and  the  Kazaks 
would  be  highly  appreciated  ;  as  also  for  the  Taranchis 
and  Kashgarians,  estimated  at  from  perhaps  ^,000,000 
to  3,000,000,  and  of  whom  4,000  or  5,000  come  yearly 
as  summer  workmen  into  Semirechia.  On  my  return 
I  brought  the  matter  before  the  Committees  of  the 
Religious  Tract  and  the  British  and  Foreign  Bible 
Societies  ;  with  what  result  has  yet  to  appear. 

Thus  we  had  a  refreshing  rest  at  Vierny,  and  made 
some  pleasant  acquaintances,  and  when  we  left  next 
morning  I  felt  we  should  have  cause  to  look  back 
thereon  as  one  of  the  green  spots  of  our  journey. 

*  I  have  subsequently  learned  its  history  to  be  this  : — ^A  version  of 
the  Scriptures,  in  plain  Turkish,  was  published  in  Oxford  in  1666, 
having  been  translated  by  Mr.  Seaman,  chaplain  at  Constantinople. 
This,  however,  was  found  to  be  too  Constantinopolitan  to  be  readily 
understood  by  the  Tatars,  who  speak  a  purer  Turkish  without  the 
circumlocution  and  foreign  words  adopted  by  the  Turks  of  the  capital. 
Seaman's  version  served,  nevertheless,  for  a  basis  on  which  Mr. 
Bruntin,  a  Scottish  missionary,  prepared  another  version,  in  Turkish, 
restored  to  its  pristine  simplicity,  for  the  Tatar  tribes  about  the  Caspian, 
and  that  was  called,  from  the  place  where  it  was  printed,  the  Karass 
version.  So  well  acquainted  was  Mr.  Bruntin  with  the  language,  and 
so  pure  and  idiomatic  was  his  style,  th^t  the  Tatars  regarded  him  as 
a  renegade  Turk.  He  died  whilst  the  work  was  going  through  the 
press,  but  the  edition  was  finished  by  his  fellow-missionary,  Mr. 
Frazer,  in  18 13.  Five  years  later  Mr.  Frazer  accommodated  this 
Karass  version  to  the  idioms  and  spelling  of  the  Kirghese  at  Orenburg, 
the  Gospel  of  Matthew  being  printed  in  i8i8,  and  the  whole  of  the  New 
Testament  in  1820,  at  Astrakhan,  at  the  expense  of  the  Russian  Bible 
Society.  It  was  this  version,  I  believe,  that  I  took  with  me  as 
"Kirghese."

"1  TS  .^HEN  the  Russians  invaded  Siberia  at  the  end 
\  V  of  the  sixteenth  century  they  were  not  at  first 
troubled  by  the  Kirghese  Kazaks,  who  at  that  time 
were  united  under  one  khan  reigning  in  the  town  of 
Turkistan.  In  the  following  century  they  were  ruled 
by  Tiavka,  the  khan  to  whom,  Mr.  Howorth  thinks, 
may  most  reasonably  be  traced  the  threefold  division 
of  the  Kazaks  into  the  Little,  the  Middle,  and  the 
Great  hordes.  These  divisions  were  at  first,  perhaps, 
merely  administrative,  but  during  the  later  years  of 
Tiavka  the  hordes  became  more  or  less  independent 
tribes,  governed  by  their  own  princes,  and  this  disinte 
gration  became  the  more  complete  when  the  Sungarian 
khan  of  the  Kalmuks,  after  inflicting  upon  the  Kazaks 


284  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

several  defeats,  took  from  them  their  capital  of  Turki- 
stan,  and  to  a  large  extent  drove  them  from  their  old 
quarters.  So  early  as  1718  we  have  Tiavka,  Kaip, 
and  Abulkhair,  each  styled  "  khan,"  appealing  to  the 
Russians  in  Siberia,  and  offering  submission,  in  the 
hope,  no  doubt,  of  receiving  assistance  against  their 
inveterate  foes  the  Kalmuks.  Thirty  years  later  we 
find  the  Kazaks  coming  to  Semipolatinsk,  where  orders 
had  been  issued  not  to  take  from  them  customs'  dues 
on  account  of  their  herds,  brought  to  the  Upper  Irtish 
forts  to  be  bartered  for  corn.  So  long,  however,  as 
the  Kalmuks  dominated  the  Irtish,  the  Kazaks  seem 
to  have  kept  at  a  respectful  distance  ;  but  immediately 
after  the  slaughter  of  the  former  in  1758,  the  Kirghese 
hastened  to  appropriate  the  vacant  pastures,  dividing 
them  under  the  rule  of  sultans.  Thus  Sultan  Ablai 
settled  on  the  streams  Tchar-K urban  and  Kyltchatz, 
and  Abdul  Faiz  in  that  part  of  the  steppe  west  of  the 
Irtish,  known  later  as  the  districts  of  Kar-karaly  and 
Kokpety.  Others,  again,  wandered  between  Omsk 
and  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  some  of  whom,  in  1758,  made 
a  raid  on  the  Russian  frontiers,  and  carried  off  220 
Tatars  from  the  district  of  Kuznetzk. 

The  Sultan  Ablai,  chief  of  a  part  of  the  Middle 
horde,  coquetted  with  both  Russians  and  Chinese,  and, 
depending  now  on  one  and  now  on  the  other,  assumed 
the  title  of  khan,  and  gave  the  Siberians  some  little 
trouble  ;  but  Sultan  Abdul  Faiz,  in  1 760,  sent  ambas- 
sadors to  Petersburg,  promising  to  protect  caravans 
from  Central  Asia  going  to  Semipolatinsk,  asked  to  be 
taken  under  Russian  sovereignty,  and  for  permission 
to  trade  at  Semipolatinsk.  This  request  was  granted, 
and  for  the  Kazaks  was  built  the  new  exchange  10 
miles    above    the   old    fort.     It    was    surrounded    by 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  SEMIRECHIA,    285 

palisades,  and  had  a  guard-house  for  the  military,  near 
which  was  a  peculiar  signal  tower  on  four  high  posts, 
the  upper  part  being  filled  with  brushwood,  to  be 
ignited  as  a  beacon  fire. 

To  this  exchange  the  Kirghese  under  the  jurisdic- 
tion of  Abdul  Faiz  came,  in  1765,  to  the  number  of 
120,  thereby  fulfilling  one  object  the  Russians  had  in 
view  in  building  it,  namely,  to  checkmate  the  Chinese, 
who  opened  a  trading  depdt  in  Sungaria,  hoping 
thereby  to  attract  the  Kirghese  to  their  sovereignty. 
The  Russians  afterwards  transferred  the  whole  of  the 
town  of  Semipolatinsk  to  the  new  site,  a  portion  of 
the  traders  being  located  in  a  suburb  on  the  left  bar\k 
of  the  Irtish,  where  the  Tashkendians  and  Bokhariots 
were  lodged.  About  a  quarter  of  a  century  later,  two 
other  quarters  were  built  on  the  same  side  of  the  river 
for  the  Kirghese,  who  had  manifested  a  desire  to 
settle,  and  to  whom  was  granted,  in  1808,  10  years* 
freedom  from  taxes. 

Thus  the  Cossacks  found  the  Kirghese  more  peace- 
able neighbours  than  the  Kalmuks,  and  more  pliable, 
so  that  they  could  afford  to  adopt  towards  them  a 
policy  of  conciliation.  Supposing  their  n^vf  prot^g^s 
to  be  Mussulmans,  the  most  Christian  and  orthodox 
Russians,  in  1 784,  went  so  far  as  to  pay  mullahs  to 
spread  over  the  steppe  the  creed  of  Muhammad,  and 
three  years  later,  for  the  further  benefit  of  their 
Islamite  subjects,  ordered  the  Koran  to  be  published ; 
and  though  the  government  was  at  this  time  sending 
into  exile  dissenters,  like  the  Dukhobortsi,  who  dared  to 
differ  from  the  Church  on  the  subject  of  the  Trinity,  they 
yet  paid  ignorant  mullahs  to  proclaim  **  There  is  but 
one  God,  and  Muhammad  is  His  prophet."  Hand  in 
hand  with  this  inconsistent  propaganda  went  on  a  more 


286  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

or  less  systematic  reconnoitring  of  new  ground  for 
future  occupation.  The  Russian  merchants  gave 
credit  to  the  Kazaks,  who  came  to  Semipolatinsk, 
and  were  consequently  obliged  to  go  on  the  steppe 
to  collect  their  debts,  being  allowed  to  do  so,  how- 
ever, only  by  permission  of  the  chief  of  the  Siberian 
line,  who,  when  permitting  the  traders  to  go,  says 
Zemlianitsin,  '*  invariably  entrusted  them  with  some 
secret  inquiries  regarding  the  condition  of  the  steppe 
people." 

These  merchants  always  took  with  them,  if  only  for 
current  expenses,  an  inconsiderable  quantity  of  Russian 
goods,  which  helped  towards  the  growth  of  a  trade 
that  afterwards  developed  largely.  In  1807  ^^^  regu- 
lations were  issued  for  the  further  extension  of  export 
trade.  For  some  time,  however,  the  Semipolatinsk 
authorities  endeavoured  to  confine  the  barter  trade  to 
the  new  exchange,  opposing  so  strongly  the  going  of 
merchants  on  to  the  steppe  as  sometimes  to  take  away 
their  account-books,  declaring  also  that  the  continued 
stay  of  the  merchants  and  their  agents  afforded  oppor- 
tunities for  intrigues  with  the  Kirghese  women,  that 
led  to  quarrels  and  pillaging. 

In  Semipolatinsk  a  frontier  court  was  established  in 
1800  for  the  trial  of  cases  with  reference  to  the  plun- 
dering of  caravans  by  the  nomads,  where  sat,  side  by 
side  with  the  Russian  commandant,  Kazak  elders. 
This  court  either  cited  the  ojffenders  and  decided  the 
affair  leniently,  or,  having  seized  the  culprits,  exposed 
them  to  the  severity  of  the  Russian  criminal  laws. 
Thus  the  Russians  were  compelled  to  allow  their  new 
subjects  to  feel  the  weight  of  their  arm,  as  well  as  to 
taste  the  sweets  of  their  clemency.  Ten  Cossacks 
were  supplied  to  each  caravan  proceeding  southwards 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  SEMIRECHIA,    287 

through  Bukhtarminsk  or  Semipolatinsk ;  and  under 
the  command  of  General  Glasenap,  that  is  from 
1808-19,  ID  regiments  of  the  line  and  9  batteries  of 
field  artillery  were  employed  in  subduing  the  Kirghese 
marauders,  who  were  at  last  so  reduced  to  subjection 
that  not  only  caravans  but  even  solitary  travellers 
could  proceed  safely  through  the  country. 

Somewhat  later,  parts  of  the  steppe  west  of  the 
Irtish  began  to  be  brought  under  Russian  administra- 
tion. In  1827  Cossacks  were  stationed  in  Kokchetaf 
(17  years  before  the  formation  of  the  okrug  of  that  name) 
and  Karkaraly,  and  about  five  years  later  the  okrugs 
of  Akmolinsk  and  Baian-Aul  were  formed.  In  the 
latter  a  smelting  foundry  for  silver  was  built  in  1 849, 
but  things  did  not  proceed  to  the  permanent  satisfac- 
tion apparently  of  the  Tchubarpaly  clan  of  Kirghese, 
who  in  1855  wandered  away  from  Karkaraly  to  the 
mountains  of  Khokand,  whilst  in  1838  Akmolinsk  had 
to  be  vigorously  defended  by  fourscore  Cossacks. 

The  Russians  had  now  set  their  faces  aggressively 
towards  the  unknown  south — unknown,  that  is,  to 
Europeans.  As  far  back  as  1 793  a  ray  of  scientific  light 
had  been  thrown  on  the  mysterious  Sungarian  country 
by  the  Russian  botanist  Si  vers,  who  penetrated  to  the 
Tarbagatai  mountains,  whither  no  scientific  traveller 
followed  him  for  40  years.  About  the  same  time, 
however,  the  mining  engineer  Sn^ghireff  penetrated  to 
Chuguchak  searching  for  gold  ;  and  in  the  archives  of 
Omsk  are  said  to  be  preserved  documents  recording  a 
wonderful  journey  accomplished  by  a  gentleman  named 
Madatof,  who  left  Semipolatinsk  in  the  early  years  of 
this  century,  passed  Issik-Kul,  crossed  the  Celestial 
Mountains,  and  penetrated  safely  to  India.  In  1821 
Bubeninof,  a    merchant,  went  from  Semipolatinsk  to 


288  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

Kashgar;  and  so  again,  in  1826,  Mr.  K.  A.  Meyer 
reached  the  Arkat  mountains,  the  Chingiz-Tau,  and  the 
Karkaraly  district  of  the  steppe.  Two  years  later  the 
illustrious  Humboldt  came  to  this  region,  but  his 
utmost  limit  was  the  Chinese  picket  of  Baty  on  the 
Irtish,  and  did  not  embrace  Sungaria  at  all.  Humboldt 
collected  at  Semipolatinsk  several  itineraries  from  Asia- 
tic traders,  and  with  the  help  of  these,  and  materials 
derived  from  Chinese  sources,  was  able  to  make  some 
shrewd  guesses  respecting  the  geography  of  Central 
Asia,  concerning  which  so  little  was  then  known. 

In  1 83 1  the  Russians  founded  Ayaguz,  that  after- 
wards became  the  chief  town  of  an  uyezd,  and  the  name 
of  which  was  changed  to  Sergiopol.  It  was  about  this 
time  that  a  portion  of  the  Great  Horde,  under  Sultan 
Siuk,  son  of  Ablai  Khan,  gave  in  its  submission, 
which  helped  to  render  not  only  Lake  Balkhash,  but 
also  the  mountain  districts  of  Sungaria,  more  accessible 
to  travellers,  so  that  in  1834  the  astronomer  Federof 
was  enabled  to  reach  the  mouth  of  the  Lepsa,  and  to 
determine  its  geographical  position.  He  also  visited 
the  southern  shore  of  Lake  Zaisan,  and  made  a  trigo- 
nometrical survey  of  the  Tarbagatai. 

A  little  later  the  relations  of  Russia  with  the  Kirghese 
hordes  became  more  satisfactory,  and  in  1840- 1-2  the 
learned  travellers  Karelin  and  Schrenk  penetrated  to 
the  snow-clad  Sungarian  Ala-Tau.  Karelin  explored 
the  wild  valleys  of  the  upper  courses  of  the  Lepsa, 
Sarkan,  and  Baskan  rivers,  as  high  as  the  snow-line. 
An  account  of  the  plants  collected  by  him  was  published 
at  Moscow  in  1842.  Schrenk  revealed  to  science  the 
Ala-Kul,  crossed  over  the  Sungarian  Ala-Tau  to  the 
Chinese  side,  and  attained  to  the  upper  course  of  the 
Tentek.     His  limit  eastwards  was  Chuguchak,  and  in 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  SEMIRECHIA,    289 

Other  directions  the  hills  skirting  the  Koksu  river,  and, 
south-west  of  the  Balkhash,  the  River  Chu. 

The  voluntary  submission  of  the  remainder  of  the 
Great  Horde  in  1844  led  to  another  Russian  advance. 
In  1846  the  Governor-General  of  Western  Siberia, 
Prince  Gortchakoff,  founded,  on  a  fertile  plateau  at  the 
base  of  a  snow-capped  spur  of  the  Ala-Tau,  the  town 
of  Kopal,  and  in  the  following  year  14,0x30  peasants, 
inhabiting  42  villages  between  the  mountains  and  the 
Irtish  line,  were  constituted  Cossacks.  This  building 
of  Kopal  ensured  the  development  of  the  existing 
relations  of  Russia  with  the  neighbouring  Chinese 
province  of  Hi,  where  at  that  time  the  trade  suffered 
from  its  contraband  character,  the  Chinese  of  the 
west  being  able  to  have  dealings  with  the  Russians 
only  under  a  semblance  of  dealing  with  the  Kirghese. 
This  led  to  the  mission,  partly  diplomatic  and  partly 
geological,  of  E.  P.  Kovalevski,  accompanied  by 
Vlangali,  an  officer  of  mining  engineers.  The  ex- 
pedition skirted  the  northern  side  of  the  Sungarian 
Ala-Tau,  to  the  valley  and  upper  sources  of  the 
Koksu,  and  then  crossed  over  the  range  to  Kuldja. 
The  opening-up  of  the  western  Chinese  region  con- 
tributed largely  to  the  increase  of  our  knowledge 
of  the  geography  of  Asia,  inasmuch  as  it  involved 
the  sending  of  two  Russo-Chinese  scholars  (one  of 
them  M.  Zakharof)  to  these  towns  in  the  capacity 
of  consuls. 

Two  years  after  the  foundation  of  Kopal,  the  town 
was  visited  by  the  artist  Atkinson,  the  first  Englishman 
to  penetrate  to  these  regions,  who  did  so  with  his 
courageous  bride.  He  visited  many  valleys  of  the 
Sungarian  Ala-Tau,  Lake  Ala-Kul,  the  Tarbagatai, 
the   rivers    Narym    and    Kurchum    in   the   southern

Altai,  and,  he  says,  many  thousand  versts  of  Chinese 
Sungaria.* 

The  town  of  Kopal  was  supposed  to  be  built  for  the 
protection  of  the  majority  of  the  Great  Horde,  now  be- 
come Russian  subjects,  from  the  Buruts,  or  the  so-called 
Black  or  Dikokamenni  Kirghese,  who  frequented  the 
valley  of  Lake  Issik-Kul  and  the  neighbourhood  of  the 
sources  of  the  Hi.  Kopal  was  situated,  however,  on 
the  northern  confines  of  the  horde,  whose  southern 
boundary  beyond  the  Hi  was  quite  unprotected.  To 
remedy  this,  and  with  a  view  to  securing  the  left  flank 
of  the  Kirghese  steppe  by  making  it  conterminous 
with  the  peaceful  frontier  and  natural  snowy  boundary 
of  China,  General  Hasford  conceived  the  plan  of  occu- 
pying the  so-called  Trans- Hi  country,  extending  between 
the  river  and  the  snow-line  of  the  Trans- Hi  Ala-Tau, 
and  this  plan  was  carried  out.  In  1853  the  first  Russian 
detachment  was  despatched  beyond  the  Hi,  where,  how- 
ever, it  met  with  serious  opposition  from  a  strong  body 

*  Unfortunately  for  Atkinson's  reputation,  M.  Semenoff,  who  went 
over  a  large  part  of  the  ground  less  than  20  years  afterwards,  has 
thrown  some  polite,  but  very  ugly,  doubts  upon  the  veracity  of  this  fart 
of  his  predecessor's  story.  Mr.  Atkinson's  narrative  is  singularly 
wanting,  M.  Semenoff  complains,  in  data  that  a  critical  mind  can  lay 
hold  of ;  but  when  the  author  does  wish  to  communicate  something  a 
litUe  definite,  and  locally  characteristic,  M.  Semenoff  says,  he  falls  into 
numerous  incongruities,  such,  for  instance,  as  seeing  from  the  Tannu 
mountains  Bogda  Ola,  in  the  Thian  Shan,  which  is  about  750  miles 
distant !  But  a  more  serious  objection  is  that  of  his  4,000  versts,  said 
to  have  been  travelled  in  Chinese  territory,  accompanied  by  three  Narym 
Cossacks.  M.  Semenoff  could  hear  nothing  on  the  spot  to  confirm 
this  from  those  who  did  accompany  Atkinson  in  at  least  some  of  his 
journeys,  nor  from  the  ofl&cers  who  provided  him  escorts,  nor  was  there 
any  record  of  the  alleged  protracted  absence  of  the  Cossacks,  as  there 
ought  to  have  been,  in  the  official  archives  ;  besides  which,  M.  Semenoff 
was  convinced  of  the  utter  impossibility  of  this  part  of  his  alleged 
journey  from  then  existing  local  conditions  on  both  the  Russian  and 
Chinese  sides. — **  Semenoff' s  Dzungaria."  See  journal  0/  the  Royal 
Geographical  Society  for  1865,  p.  219. 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  SEMIRECHIA,    291 

of  Kirghese,  belonging  to  those  tribes  of  the  Great 
Horde,  who  remained  hostile,  having  for  their  base 
Fort  Tuchubek,  on  the  River  Kesken. 

But  in  the  following  year  the  whole  of  the  region 
was  occupied  by  a  force  under  Peremyshelski,  who 
razed  the  Kirghese  fort  to  the  ground.  After  this, 
more  of  the  tribes  submitted  to  Russia,  whilst  others 
still  inimical  fled  into  the  territory  of  Khokand,  and  to 
the  banks  of  the  Talas  and  Syr-daria.  The  Russian 
detachment  wintered  in  the  sheltered  valley  of  the 
Talgar,  and  in  the  ensuing  year,  1855,  General  Has- 
ford  founded  Fort  Vernoe. 

Thus,  within  a  quarter  of  a  century,  Russia  pushed 
out  her  advanced  posts  to  a  distance  of  600  miles 
beyond  Semipolatinsk,  which  continued  an  important 
centre  of  trade,  for  the  increase  of  which  several 
measures  were  proposed.  In  1821  the  merchant  Popoff 
had  attempted  to  re-open  caravan  trade  between  Semi- 
polatinsk and  Kashgar,  and  in  1847  another  merchant, 
Golubkoff,  printed  a  pamphlet  upon  the  advantage  to 
Russia  of  an  overland  trade  with  India ;  whilst,  seven 
years  later,  Tatarinoff,  the  consul  at  Chuguchak,  re- 
ported in  favour  of  establishing  a  line  of  steam-boats 
on  the  Irtish  to  the  Nor  Zaisan,  and  the  construction 
of  a  shorter  trade  route  to  Chuguchak,  through 
Kokpety  and  the  Tarbagatai  mountains. 

Meanwhile  the  civil  administration  of  the  Russians 
was  following  in  the  wake  of  their  military  proceed- 
ings. In  1854  there  was  formed  an  oblast  of  Siberian 
Kirghese,  with  its  chief  town  of  Omsk,  but  it  was  not 
till  1862  that  the  stanitza  of  Akmolinsk,  that  after- 
wards gave  its  name  to  the  oblast,  was  elevated  to 
the  dignity  of  an  okrug  town.  Concurrently  with  the 
formation  of  the  Kirghese  oblast,  the  town  of  Semipo- 


zQa  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

latinsk  became  the  capital  of  a  province,  and  vigorous 
measures  were  carried  out  for  connecting  therewith  by 
roads  the  new  outposts.  In  1846  the  Cossacks  had 
been  permitted  to  carry  the  post  between  Ust- 
Kamenogorsk  and  Kokpely,  and  two  years  later  they 
received  4,477  roubles  (say  ^670,  that  is  reckoning  the 
rouble  at  3^.  at  this  date)  for  doing  the  same  to  Kopal, 


and  a  like  sum,  six  years  later,  for  maintaining  the 
postal  service  between  Kopal  and  Vierny.  It  was  not 
till  1859  that  postal  communication  was  established 
between  Setgiopol  and  Urjar. 

It  was  about  this  time  that  measures  were  taken 
to  colonize  with  Cossacks  and  peasants  the  newly- 
acquired  country ;  Russia  illustrating,  in  so  doing,  her 
happy  facility  in  making,  as  just  before  she  had  done 
in   unmaking,   a   military   population.      In    1848   the 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  SEMIRECHIA.    293 

military  line  between  Biisk  and  Kuznetsk  in  Western 
Siberia  was  discontinued,  and  its  Cossack  population 
changed  into  peasants.  Six  years  later  an  Imperial 
ukase  went  forth  that  200  Cossacks  with  200  families 
of  peasants  and  exiles  should  emigrate.  The  Cossacks 
were  to  be  taken  from  Siberian  regiments,  those  wish- 
ing to  emigrate  being  first  invited  to  volunteer,  the 
remaining  number  being  made  up  by  lot.  The  first 
hundred  were  sent  out  in  1855,  and  the  remainder  in 
the  year  following.  Pecuniary  help  was  granted  to 
them  at  the  rate  of  100  roubles  each  to  the  officers, 
and  55  roubles  to  the  lower  grades,  whilst  for  the  first 
three  years  they  were  to  have  regulation  rations,  forage 
for  horses,  and  exemption  from  active  service,  with 
increased  pay.  They  were  also  supplied  with  accoutre- 
ments,  with  seed-corn,  returnable  in  three  years,  and 
an  order  was  given  that  house-keeping  utensils  should 
be  purchased  at  the  Irbit  fair,  and  supplied  to  them  at 
reduced  prices. 

The  peasants  likewise  came  from  Western  Siberia, 
Each  family  received  the  release  from  all  debts  to  the 
government,  3J  kopecks,  or  rather  more  than  \d. 
per  head  per  day,  money  for  guides  through  the 
steppe,  and  on  their  arrival  about  80  acres  of  land, 
with  seed-corn  returnable  in  four  years.  Being  enlisted 
into  the  Cossack  regiments,  50  roubles  was  granted  to 
each  family  for  settling  and  purchase  of  animals,  and  two 
years'  exemption  from  active  service.  In  this  manner 
was  conducted  the  colonizing  of  Lepsinsk  with  3,000, 
and  Urjarsk  with  1,000  souls,  as  also  of  Vierny,  the 
emigration  being  organized  and  superintended  by 
Colonels  Shanbine  and  Spiridonoff.  The  circumstance 
should  also  be  mentioned  that  the  sums  of  money 
allotted  to  the  settlers  were  drawn  in  a  manner  from 


294  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

the  Kirghese  steppes — partly  from  a  surplus  accumu- 
lated under  the  Governor  General  in  consequence  of  a 
short  complement  of  civil  officers,  and  partly  out  of  the 
revenue  on  the  metal  mined  in  the  district. 

It  was  only  natural  that  the  progress  of  the  Russians 
into  Central  Asia — a  country  that  had  been  so  long 
hidden  from  scientific  eyes — should  make  a  stir  among 
lovers  of  inquiry,  and  the  passion  for  geographical 
expeditions  was  so  stirred  thereby  that  in  1845  ^^ 
founded  the  Imperial  Russian  Geographical  Society, 
under  whose  auspices  and  at  whose  cost  M.  P.  P. 
Semenoff  was  sent,  in  1856,  to  explore  those  more  acces- 
sible portions  of  Central  Asia  that  had  previously  been 
little  visited.  To  him  belongs  the  honour  of  being  the 
first  scientific  European  traveller  to  ascend  the  Tengri 
Tag,  though  nine  years  previously  the  topographer 
Infantief  had  crossed  the  Ili,  and  compiled  an  enlarged 
chart  of  Issik-Kul,  and  of  the  roads  leading  past  it  to 
Kashgar  and  Uch-Turfan.  Also  the  destruction  of  the 
kingdom  of  Sungaria  had  led  to  that  country  being 
surveyed  for  the  Chinese  by  the  European  missionaries 
Felix  d'  Arocha  and  Hallerstein,  by  whom  trigonome- 
trical points  were  determined  not  only  in  the  towns  of 
Sungaria  and  Little  Bokhara,  but  also  at  the  foot  of  the 
Thian  Shan  or  Celestial  range,  and  on  the  southern 
shore  of  Issik-Kul. 

The  Russian  occupation  of  the  Trans- Ili  region 
had  the  effect  of  protecting  the  Great  Horde  from  the 
attacks  of  the  Buruts,  but  placed  the  nearest  tribes  in 
the  same  position  relatively  as  that  occupied  10  years 
previously  by  the  Great  Horde.  The  powerful  and 
numerous  tribe  of  the  Bogus,  who  occupied  the 
picturesque  valleys  and  the  tableland  between  the 
Celestial     Mountains     and     the    Trans- Ili    Ala-Tau, 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  SEMIRECHIA,    295 

received  neither  countenance  nor  support  from  the 
Chinese  (on  whom  they  were  nominally  dependent), 
in  resisting  the  fierce  attacks  of  the  Sary  Bogish  tribe, 
and  they  had,  at  the  same  time,  to  repel  from  another 
quarter  the  depredatory  incursions  of  some  of  their 
neighbours  of  the  Great  Horde.  Consequently,  soon 
after  the  Russian  occupation  of  the  Trans- Hi  district, 
the  high  Manap  of  the  Bogu  tribe,  the  old  Burambai, 
claimed  the  assistance  of  General  Hasford  against  the 
attacks  of  his  foes,  and  voluntarily  tendered  his  sub- 
mission to  Russian  government. 

This  led  to  the  despatch  of  the  first  Russian 
detachment  from  Vierny  to  Lake  Issik-Kul,  for  the 
purpose  of  pacifying  the  two  contending  tribes,  and 
making  a  reconnaissance  of  the  valley  of  Lake  Issik- 
Kul.  Unfortunately,  this  detachment,  in  consequence 
of  its  critical  position  amidst  the  marauding  mountain 
tribes,  the  animosity  of  one  of  which  against  the 
Russians  was  decided,  whilst  the  friendliness  of  the 
other  was  open  to  much  suspicion,  was  soon  recalled, 
and  the  surveying  parties  were  unable  to  penetrate 
into  the  interior.  Their  southernmost  point,  attained 
at  the  foot  of  the  Thian  Shan,  was  where  the  Zauku 
rushes  out  on  the  Issik-Kul  plateau. 

Two  months  after  the  visit  of  this  fore-mentioned 
expedition  to  Issik-Kul,  M.  Semenoff  set  out  from 
Vierny,  and  with  a  small  escort  of  12  Cossacks 
succeeded  in  reaching  the  eastern  extremity  of  the 
lake,  whence  he  returned  to  Vierny  for  an  escort  of 
40  Cossacks,  and  then  proceeded  through  the  wild 
Buam  defile  at  the  upper  course  of  the  Chu,  and 
emerged  on  the  base  of  the  Celestial  range,  near  the 
western  extremity  of  the  Lake  Issik-Kul.  Here  he 
came  upon  numerous  encampments  of  hostile  tribes, 


296  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

who  had  been  recently  chastised  by  the  Russians, 
which  caused  him  to  return  to  Vierny.  In  the  follow- 
ing spring,  however,  Semenoff  was  enabled  to  realize 
all  his  plans.  He  made  a  (Utour  of  Issik-Kul  from 
the  south  side,  and  reached  the  summit  of  the  imposing 
and  terrible  Zauku-Davan  pass.  He  also  succeeded 
in  gaining  the  sources  of  the  Narym,  belonging  to  the 
system  of  the  Jaxartes  or  Syr-daria.  Shortly  after 
he  penetrated  eastwards,  and  ascended  one  of  the 
most  elevated  mountain  groups  of  inner  Asia,  that  of 
the  Tengri-Tag,  21,000  feet  high,  crowned  with  a  circle 
of  Alpine  glaciers,  and  covered  with  a  dazzling  mantle 
of  eternal  snow.  M.  Semenoff*  was  accompanied  by 
the  topographers  Yanof  and  Varaksin,  who  worked 
out  the  survey  to  Issik-Kul. 

On  M.  Semenoff 's  return  to  Petersburg  in  1858 
the  Imperial  Geographical  Society  organized  a  new 
expedition,  under  Captain  Golubeff,  for  the  purpose  of 
determining  trigonometrical  points  in  Russian  Sungaria 
and  on  the  Lake  Issik-Kul,  in  the  execution  of  which 
he  was  able  to  fix  mathematically  the  geography  of 
the  country  north  of  the  Hi,  and  of  the  Thian  Shan 
near  Issik-Kul;  but,  owing  to  the  southern  shore  of 
the  lake  being  occupied  by  the  hostile  Sary-Bogish 
tribe,  he  was  unable  to  penetrate  into  the  interior  of 
the  Thian  Shan. 

This  was  effected,  however,  by  Captain  Valikhanoff, 
the  son  of  a  Kirghese  sultan,  who,  in  the  disguise  of  a 
Khokand  merchant,  joined  a  native  caravan  near  Kopal,

and  travelled  therewith,  in  1859,  even  to  Kashgar, 
in  doing  which,  and  returning,  he  twice  crossed  the 
whole  of  the  Thian  Shan  range  between  Issik-Kul 
and  Kashgaria,  passing  by  Lake  Chatir-Kul.  In  the 
following  year,  i860,  M.  E.  Veniukoff  surveyed  and 
mapped  the  whole  of  the  Issik-Kul  country,  including 
the  valleys  of  the  Chu  and  Koshkur,  and  did  good 
service  in  publishing  information  obtained  about  Lake 
Son-Kul,  whilst  Captain  Protzenko  made  additions 
to  Veniukoff*s  work  in  his  survey  of  the  country  to 
the  River  Narym  at  Fort  Kurtka,  which  he  destroyed. 

The  Trans- Narym  district  became  part  of  Russian 
■dominions  by  the  treaty  of  Peking  in  i860,  by  which 
treaty  the  frontier  line  with  China  was  fixed  east 
of  Lake  Issik-Kul,  along  the  southern  spurs  of 
the  Celestial  Mountains,  to  the  Khokand  territory,  so 
including  within  the  Russian  boundaries  nearly  the 
whole  of  the  mountainous  district  south  of  the  Issik- 
Kul,  which  was  formed  into  the  Ala-Tau  okrug, 
in  1862,  with  Vierny  for  its  chief  town. 

In  this  mountainous  region,  wherein  are  situated  the 
head-waters  of  the  Syr-daria  and  the  Alpine  lakes  of 
Son-Kul  and  Chatir-Kul,  there  yet  remained  an  unex- 
plored district  south  of  the  Narym,  along  the  road  to 
Kashgar.  To  the  examination  of  this  district  Colonel 
Poltoratzky  was  sent  in  1867.  Baron  Osten-Sacken 
accompanied  him,  and  the  two  proceeded  over  the 
Kastek  pass  almost  directly  south,  past  Lake  Chatir-Kul, 
to  Teshek-tash,  within  30  miles  of  Kashgar.*  Baron 
Osten-Sacken,  to  whom  I  referred  as  having  met 
him    in   Petersburg,  is  a    botanist,  and  brought  back

numerous    specimens    of   plants,    besides    mentioning 
many  others. 

Thus  the  land  occupied  by  the  Kirghese  was  being 
gradually  annexed  by  Russian  arms,  and  ruled  by 
Russian  administration.  In  1867  the  oblast  of  Semi- 
rechia  was  formed,  including  the  Ala-Tau  and  the 
Sergiopol  districts,  the  whole  constituting  the  most 
easterly  province  of  Turkistan,  and  in  the  following 
year  the  oblasts  of  Akmolinsk  and  Semipolatinsk 
were  readjusted  with  new  boundaries,  the  town  of 
Akmolinsk  being  made  into  a  provincial  capital, 
though  the  oblast  administration  and  all  the  chief 
administration  of  Western  Siberia  remained  in  Omsk ; 
and  so  things  remained  nearly  until  the  time  of  my 
visit,  just  before  which  Semirechia  had  been  detached 
from  Turkistan,  to  make,  with  the  two  Siberian  pro- 
vinces of  Akmolinsk  and  Semipolatinsk,  the  General 
Government  of  the  Steppe. 

After  the  subjection  of  the  Kirghese,  the  Russians 
had  to  meet  another  enemy  in  the  Khokandians.  In 
i860  troops  were  sent  from  Vierny,  under  Colonel 
Zimmerman,  to  seize  the  Khokandian  forts  of  Tokmak 
and  Pishpek,  160  miles  distant.  This  they  accom- 
plished, thereby  exasperating  the  enemy,  who  collected 
his  forces  to  an  estimated  number  of  40,000,  and  tried 
to  take  the  Russian  troops,  only  1,000  strong,  by 
surprise.  The  attempt  failed,  thanks  mainly  to  the 
skill  of  General  Kolpakovsky,  and  the  Trans-Ili 
country  was  henceforth  secured  to  the  invaders.  These 
engagements,  however,  with  the  Khokandians  from 
the  Irtish  line  bring  us  to  a  foe  the  Russians  had  long 
been  attacking  on  the  Syr-daria  line,  from  the  direction 
of  Orenburg,  which  opens  up  another  field  of  history 
to  be  treated  in  subsequent  chapters. 


CHAPTER  XXI. 

THE    KIRGHE  SE, 

Resemblance  of  Kirghese  nomads  to  Hebrew  patriarchs. — Primeval 
character  of  the  steppe. — Existence  there  of  Biblical  customs : 
whence  came  they  ? — Authorities  on  the  Kirghese. — Etymology  of 
name. — Their  sub-divisions,  habitat,  and  numbers. — Origin  of 
Kara- Kirghese  and  Kirghese  Kazaks. — ^Appearance  of  Kirghese  : 
their  physique,  diseases,  disposition,  and  character. — Their  con- 
scientiousness concerning  an  oath. — Their  distribution,  ranks,  and 
governing  authorities. — Kirghese  habitations  and  tombs. — Dresses, 
ornaments,  and  weapons. 

IT  was  with  keen  interest  that  I  approached  the 
tents  of  the  Kirghese.  As  a  Biblical  student, 
it  had  occurred  to  me  how  intensely  interesting  it 
would  be  to  witness  people  living  in  a  stage  of 
civilization  nearly  resembling  that  of  the  Hebrew 
patriarchs,  and  I  had  supposed  that  this  might  best 
be  accomplished  by  a  journey  up  the  Euphrates 
valley  to  Palestine.  But  I  came  to  the  conclusion, 
after  seeing  the  Kirghese,  that  in  them  I  had  met 
with  more  truthful  representatives  of  the  manner  of 
life  of  Abraham,  Isaac,  and  Jacob,  than  if  I  had  gone 
to  the  soil  those  patriarchs  trod,  because  the  elements 
of  change  have  been  less  busily  at  work  in  the 
Kirghese  steppe  than  in  the  Holy  Land.  Since 
Abraham's  day  the  Land  of  Promise  has  seen  the 
rise  and  fall   of  the   Jewish  nationality.      Later,   the 


300  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

country  has  been  conquered  by  Assyrians,  Egyptians, 
Babylonians,  Persians,  Greeks,  and  Romans ;  and 
now  the  features  of  its  Eastern  life  are  suggested 
rather  than  portrayed  by  Arab  sheikhs,  who  have 
long  had  contact  with  Turks  and  Franks. 

But  the  Kirghese  steppe  has  not  been  thus  in- 
fluenced by  foreign  conquerors  to  anything  like  a 
similar  extent,  for  it  lay  off  the  area  of  the  great 
battle-fields  of  Central  Asia.  Maveraunnehar,  or  the 
country  between  the  Oxus  and  Jaxartes,  with  the 
Zarafshan  valley,  has  been  conquered  again  and 
again  from  the  west  by  Persians,  Greeks,  Arabs, 
and  Turkomans,  and  from  the  east  by  Chinese, 
Mongols,  and  Turks ;  but  these  billows,  tremendous 
as  they  were,  did  little  more  than  burst  upon  the 
southern  shores  of  the  vast  northern  steppes,  of  whose 
history  in  early  ages  we  know  almost  nothing.  None 
of  the  armies  from  the  west  pushed  their  way  beyond 
the  Jaxartes,  which  represented  to  the  old  world  of 
Central  Asia  the  boundary  between  civil  and  savage 
life.  We  do  not  read  of  the  Chinese  generals  pene- 
trating there.  Even  the  creed  of  Muhammad  had 
failed  to  lay  hold  of  the  Kazaks,  when  the  Russians 
ascended  the  Irtish  to  meet  with  a  people  who  had 
never  seen  the  face  of  a  European,  whose  only  other 
invading  foe  perchance  had  been  their  neighbouring, 
perhaps  half-brother,  Mongols,  and  who  might,  there- 
fore, be  supposed  to  be  living  with  the  primeval 
manners,  customs,  and  laws,  handed  down  from  their 
forefathers.  It  should  be  remembered,  moreover, 
that  a  quarter  of  a  century  has  not  yet  passed  since 
the  Russians  could  with  safety  travel  to  all  parts  of 
the  steppe,  in  some  portions  of  which  still  they  number 
less  than  one  European  to  a  hundred  natives.     There 


THE  KIRGHESE.  301 

must  be  masses  of  these  children  of  the  desert  who 
as  yet  have  scarcely  seen,  much  less  lived  in,  a  town ; 
who  neither  speak  nor  have  heard  any  language  but 
their  own,  and  who  know  only  their  own  patriarchal 
usages  and  laws ;  so  that,  when  this  is  borne  in  mind, 
it  will  seem  probable  that  in  the  Kirghese  may  be 
witnessed  an  earlier  stage  of  pastoral  life  than  could 
be  seen  in  the  countries  made  familiar  to  us  by  the 
Scriptures.  I  have  been  the  more  engrossed  with 
this  thought  because  I  discovered  still  existing  in  the 
steppe  certain  laws  and  customs  that  obtained  not 
only  in  the  times  of  Moses,  but  in  those  of  the  great- 
grandchildren of  Abraham.  The  question  arises, 
then,  Whence  came  these  laws  into  the  steppe  ?  If 
from  the  Koran,  matters  will  be  simplified ;  but  even 
then  there  will  remain  a  further  question  whether  they 
are  due  to  Muhammadan  influence  only,  or  whether 
they  may  not  antedate  the  Koran  (which  has  many 
resemblances,  we  know,  to  the  Pentateuch),  and  come 
from  the  Abrahamic  times  of  which  Moses  wrote — in 
which  case  we  are  sent  back  to  a  very  remote  past 
that  is  full  of  both  Scriptural  and  ethnographical 
interest.  Apart  from  these  problems,  moreover,  there 
remains  the  fact  that  the  Kirghese  occupy  the 
largest  territory,  and  are  the  most  numerous  of  all 
the  peoples  of  Russian  Central  Asia,  It  will  there- 
fore be  proper  that  a  space  should  be  devoted  to 
their  consideration.* 

*  There  are  not  wanting  materials  from  which  information  may  be 
drawn.  Not  to  mention  the  few  Oriental  writers,  and  European 
mediaeval  travellers  who  allude  to  the  Kirghese,  there  is  first  the 
classical  work  of  Levshine,  much  of  which,  with  information  added  from 
other  sources,  appears  in  the  tomes  of  Howorth,  and  there  are  the 
simple  descriptions  of  Kirghese  customs  by  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Atkinson.. 
These  were  written,  however  (with  the  exception  of  Howorth),  before 
the  nomads  were  so  well  known  to  European  scholars  as  now,  and  are 


302  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

The  derivation  of  the  word  **  Kirghese,"  spelt  also 
Kirgiz,  Kirgeze,  Kirghiz,  and  pronounced  by  them- 
selves K^rg^z,  has  not  been  very  satisfactorily  ex- 
plained. Radloff,  whose  knowledge  of  their  language 
has  been  praised  by  M.  Ujfalvy,  derives  the  word 
from  Kyrk,  forty,  and  is,  a  hundred,  there  being  two 
tribes  so  called ;  but  a  commoner  etymology  is  that 
of  Kyrk,  forty,  and  Kyz,  maiden,  in  allusion  to  a  legend 
about  forty  girls  and  a  dog,  that  is  told  also  by  the 
surrounding  tribes,  and  by  a  Chinese  writer  as  far 
back  as  the  time  of  the  Mongol  supremacy.*  They 
belong  to  the  Turco-Tatar  or  Altai  race,  and  their  two 
principal  divisions  coincide  with  the  surface  of  their 
territory,  the  Kara-Kirghese,  or  Kirghese  proper,  as 
they  are  sometimes  called,  inhabiting  the  mountains, 
and  the  Kazaks  the  plains. 

The  Kara  (Black)  or  Dikokamenni  (Wild  Mountain) 
Kirghese,    called     also    by    Chinese    and    Kalmuks 

probably  within  reach  of  my  readers,  so  that  I  have  used  them  bvt 
little.  I  have  preferred  rather  to  seek  information  from  Russian 
authors,  who,  to  a  lar^e  extent,  have  drawn  their  inspiration  from 
personal  observation,  as  in  the  cases  of  Valikhanoff,  at  once  a  Russian 
officer  and  the  son  of  a  sultan,  who  travelled  as  a  native  among  the 
Kara-Kirghese ;  RoUo,  who  lectured  in  the  half  Kirghese  town  of 
Orenburg,  with  Kostenko  and  Mayeflf,  all  of  whom  wrote  on  the  spot 
for  readers  who  could  test  the  accuracy  of  their  statements  by  what 
they  saw.  M.  Ujfalvy* s  work  I  have  found  useful  for  its  anthropology, 
whilst  through  the  kindness  of  Mrs.  Telfer,  in  translating  for  roe  Kozloff 
and  Gotobitzky,  on  the  laws  of  the  Kirghese  and  the  characteristics 
of  their  songs,  I  have  become  acquainted  with  information  hitherto 
unpublished  in  English. 

*  It  is  curious  to  note  in  connection  with  this,  as  Dr.  Schuyler  points 
out,  the  story  given  by  King  Hethum,  the  mediaeval  traveller,  of  the 
people  living  beyond  Khatai — that  is,  east  of  the  region  inhabited  by 
the  Kirghese.  **  There  is,"  he  said,  "beyond  the  Khatai,  a  country 
where  the  women  have  the  shape  of  human  beings,  and  are  gifted  with 
speech  ;  while  the  men  have  that  of  dogs,  and  are  dumb,  large,  and 
hairy,  and  of  whose  progeny,"  he  adds,  *'the  males  are  bom  in  the 
shape  of  dogs,  and  the  females  like  women. 


THE  KIRGHESE.  303 

Buruts  (a  Mongolian  form  of  the  plural,  as  seen  in 
the  Yakut,  Torgut,  Tangut),  are  sub-divided  into  two 
wings,  ''On''  and  ''Sol,'' — that  is,  right  and  left — 
among  the  latter  of  whom  are  certain  tribes  whose 
names  we  met  with  in  conflict  with  the  Russians,  such 
as  the  Sarybaguish  and  Bogu.  These  wild  Kirghese 
roam  in  Semirechia,  Ferghana,  and  Kashgaria — that 
is,  in  the  valleys  of  the  Thian  Shan,  the  Alai,  and 
the  Pamir,  almost  to  Tibet  and  Hindustan. 

The  Kirghese  of  the  plains  call  themselves  (as  my 
friend  Mr.  Howorth  would  have  me  always  call  them) 
**  Kazaks,"  or  horsemen  (some  say  fugitive,  vagabond, 
robber),  whence  is  derived  the  Russian  word  **  Cos- 
sack." They  are  divided  into  the  Little,  Middle,  and 
Great  Hordes,  each  of  which  is  sub-divided  into  races, 
the  races  into  tribes,  the  tribes  into  clans,  and  these  into 
aulsy  or  groups  of  tents,  each  living  in  independence.* 

The  number  of  the  Kirghese  can  be  estimated  only 
by  calculating  5  persons  to  each  Kibitka  that  pays 
taxes.!     I  compute  them  at  two  and  a  quarter  millions. 

*  These  sub-divisions  of  the  Little  and  Middle  Hordes  are  ^riven  in 
some  detail  by  Levshine  ;  but  he  says  little  of  the  Great  Horde,  which 
in  his  day  (from  1820-30)  was  not  much  known  to  the  Russians,  though 
Valikhanoff  gives  a  short  account  thereof.  The  Little  Horde  occupies 
the  Orenburg  sleppe,  or  parts  of  the  provinces  of  Orenburg,  Ural,  and 
Turgai,  and  consists  of  three  races  broken  up  into  25  tribes.  The  Middle 
Horde  inhabits  the  provinces  of  Akmolinsk  and  Semipolatinsk,  and 
consists  of  4  races  or  37  tribes,  whilst  the  Great  Horde  nomadizes 
in  Semirechia,  south  of  Lake  Balkhash  and  Turkistan,  and  consists  of 
5  races,  or  19  tribes.  Besides  these,  M.  Ujfalvy  mentions  two  modem 
and  less-known  hordes — ^that  of  Boukei,  or  the  Inner  Horde,  near  the 
Caspian,  dating  from  1801,  and  the  Kazaks  of  Chinese  Turkistan.  The 
Inner  Horde  was  formed  by  about  7,000  of  the  Little  Horde,  led  by 
Bukeief,  grandson  of  Abul-Khair,  who  crossed  the  Urals  to  occupy  the 
land  left  vacant  on  the  flight  of  the  Torgout  Kalmuks. 

t  Thus  reckoned,  says  Dr.  Schuyler,  **  there  are  in  all  about  a  million 
and  a  half.  In  the  Great  Horde  there  are  about  100,000  of  both  sexes, 
in  the  Middle  Horde  406,000,  in  the  Lesser  Horde  800,000,  and  the 


304  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

The  origin  of  the  Kara-Kirghese,  Levshine  says,  is 
lost  in  the  night  of  fable  and  of  Turkish  history.  That 
they  are  one  of  the  ancient  peoples  of  Central  Asia  he 
argues  because  in  569  a.d.  a  Kerkhiz  or  Kirghiz  slave 
(if  this  do  not  mean  Cherkess  or  Circassian,  as  some 
think)  was  given  by  Dizabul,  a  Central  Asian  khan, 
to  a  Constantinopolitan  envoy  returning  to  Justin  II. 
Abul-Ghazi  mentions  the  power  of  the  Kirghese 
anterior  to  the  times  of  Jinghiz  Khan,  placing  their 
location  between  the  rivers  Selenga  and  Ikar- 
Mourane  *  Chinese  historians  of  the  seventh  century 
knew  them  as  Khakas,  inhabiting  a  wide  extent  of 
country,  and  in  intimate  relations  with  the  Chinese, 
Arabs,  and  people  of  Eastern  Turkistan.  In  the 
tenth  century  the  might  of  the  Khakas  declined,  and 
they  disappear  from  history.  It  is  not  improbable, 
Mr.  Howorth  thinks,  that  by  Khakas,  or  Hakas,  the 
Chinese  meant  the  Oghuz  Turks  of  the  Arab  geo- 
graphers, called  Odkhoz  by  the  Nubian  geographer. 
These  were  apparently  the  ancestors  of  the  Kazaks, 
and  were,  like  the  latter,  divided  into  three  Hordes. 

In  the  thirteenth  century  we  again  meet  with 
Kirghese,  called  by  the  Chinese  Kiluki-tsi,  The 
movements  among  the  nomad  tribes  between  the 
tenth  and  thirteenth  centuries  seem  to  have  cut  the 

Inner  Horde,  perhaps  150,000."  These  numbers,  however,  seem  to  me 
too  small,  for  according  to  Kostenko  and  the  numbers  I  gave  in  previous 
ch^ters,  they  stand  thus  : —

Klaproth,  Part  II.,  Chap,  i.,  p.  119,  upon  which  Valikhanoff,  p.  271, 
throws  further  light  in  treating  of  the  Dikokamenni  Horde,  whilst

THE  KIRGHESE,  305 

Kirghese  in  two,  the  greater  portion  being  where  the 
Kara-Kirghese  now  are,  and  the  remainder  in  Siberia, 
on  the  upper  waters  of  the  Yenesei.  This  latter  portion 
disappeared  apparently  in  the  eighteenth  century, 
partly  conquered  by  the  Russian  colonists,  and  partly 
cut  off  by  or  absorbed  into  the  Kalmuks.  At  the 
end  of  the  century  the  Kara-Kirghese  were  subject  to 
the  Chinese.  Subsequently  they  came  under  the 
dominion  of  Khokand,  but  in  1842  they  made  them- 
selves practically  independent  until,  as  I  have  shown 
in  a  former  chapter,  the  disputes  of  the  different 
tribes,  especially  those  of  Bogu  and  Sary-Bagysh, 
caused  them,  one  after  another,  to  ask  to  be  taken 
under  Russian  protection.  R6clus  gives  their  number 
at  from  350,000  to  400,000. 

Concerning  the  origin  of  the  Kazaks,  sometimes 
called  Kirghese-Kazaks,  Levshine  gives  no  less  than 
seven  traditions,  the  first  of  which  makes  them  emi- 
grants from  the  Crimea,  and  the  third  affirms  that 
their  ancestors  lived  on  the  banks  of  the  Euphrates. 

If  this  latter  were  true,  it  would  help  to  throw  light 
upon  Kirghese  customs  now  obtaining,  which  were 
known  to  the  great-grandchildren  of  Abraham.  From 
the  Euphrates  this  tradition  says  they  were  driven  by 
the  Turks  on  the  land  of  the  wild  Kirghese,  to  whose 
khan  they  submitted,  and  since  he  employed  them 
only  as  **  Kazaks"  for  fighting  his  enemies,  they 
got  the  name  of  Kirghese-Kazaks — i.e.,  Kazaks  of 
the  Kirghese  Khan.  Other  traditions  make  them 
descended  from  the  Turkish  tribes  of  Central  Asia 
and  Siberia,  that  is,  from  the  Ghuz  or  Oghuz  of  the 
Arabs,  of  whom  the  Comans  of  the  Russian  steppes 
and  the  original  unsophisticated  Turkomans  were 
branches,    which    is    the     explanation    favoured     by 

VOL.  I.  20 


3o6  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Mr.  Howorth,  who  says  that  in  the  second  half  of 
the  fifteenth  century  they  followed  Sultans  Girei  and 
Jani  Bek  to  the  neighbourhood  of  the  Balkhash, 
where  they  were  joined  by  others,  and  flourished 
into  a  community  known  among  their  neighbours  as 
Kazaks,  or  refugees  par  excellence.  Gaining  more 
and  more  strength,  they  conquered,  in  1598,  under 
their  khan,  Tevvekel,  the  provinces  of  Tashkend 
and  Turkistan,  which  latter  was  the  seat  of  the 
Kirghese  dynasty,  as  I  have  before  mentioned,  till 
they  were  dispossessed  by  the  Sungarians  in  1723. 
Rather  than  submit  to  the  Kalmuk  khan,  the  Middle 
and  Lesser  Hordes  made  a  despairing  movement 
westwards,  drove  out  the  Bashkirs  between  the  Sea 
of  Aral,  the  Caspian,  and  the  River  Ural,  and  thus 
became  the  immediate  neighbours  of  the  Russians, 
to  whom  they  gradually  submitted. 

In  appearance,  as  in  geographical  position,  a  Kir- 
ghese is  midway  between  a  Mongol  and  a  Caucasian. 
M.  Ujfalvy  corrects  M.  Girard  de  Rialle,  who  says 
that  the  Kara- Kirghese  have  all  the  characteristics 
attributed  to  pure  Mongols.  The  men  are  below 
rather  than  above  the  middle  stature.  The  women 
are  almost  all  short,  perhaps  accounted  for  by  the 
hard  work  to  which  they  are  subjected.* 

*  From  II  Kazaks  that  he  measured,  M.  Ujfalvy  obtained  a  mean 
of  5  feet  \\  inches,  and  for  25  Kara- Kirghese  5  feet  11  inches.  Of  these 
latter,  11  had  ample  beards,  15  scanty,  and  2  none ;  whilst  of  the  11 
Kazaks,  7  had  scanty  beards,  and  4  none.  All  the  Kazaks,  and  all  the 
Kara- Kirghese,  except  2,  had  the  skin  smooth.  The  head  is  not  very 
large,  the  cranium  round  or  pointed,  rather  than  flat,  and  the  cheek- 
bones stand  out,  though  not  so  sharply  as  those  of  Mongols  and 
Kalmuks  generally.  The  skin  is  bronzed,  yellowish,  sometimes  rather 
dark,  the  covered  parts  being  white,  especially  with  the  women.  Indi- 
vidual Kirghese  of  fair  countenance  are  met  with,  butonly  rarely.  The  hair 
is  usually  black,  sometimes  chestnut,  dark,  glossy,  and  even  stiff.  The 
narrow,  obliquely  diverging  eyes  are  brilliant  and  sharp,  and  in  colour 


THE  KIRGHESE,  307 

The  Kirghese  are  fairly  strong,  but  clumsy,  with 
slouching  gait  on  foot,  though  bold  riders,  excelled  in 
this  respect  only  by  the  Kalmuks.  Their  sense  of 
sight  is  so  keenly  developed,  that  on  level  ground 
they  can  see  small  objects  at  seven  miles'  distance  ;  and 
when  a  European  can  perceive  but  the  barest  outline, 
the  Kirghese  is  able  to  distinguish  its  details,  as  the 
•colour  of  a  horse,  etc.  Their  capacity  for  finding  their 
way  is  not  less  remarkable  ;  the  smallest  elevation  of 
ground  serves  a  Kazak  as  a  sign  he  never  forgets ; 
and  if  there  be  no  mark,  the  presence  of  certain  grasses 
and  the  direction  in  which  they  grow  often  show  him 
the  road.  Eye-witnesses  relate  that,  after  having  lost 
the  road,  a  Kirghese  has  been  seen  to  dismount,  tear 
up  a  handful  of  dry  grass,  and,  after  smelling  it,  quietly 
•change  his  direction.  These  qualities,  says  M.  Potto, 
make  them  useful  for  reconnoitring  duties,  but  their 
military  valour  and  courage  are  doubtful. 

They  are,  as  a  rule,  fairly  healthy.  In  the  3,111 
cases  (including  1,044  females)  attended  in  1881  by 
the  district  physicians  of  Semipolatinsk,  the  majority 
of  Kirghese  appeared  to  be  suffering  from  ague,  fever, 
catarrh,   and  diseases  of  the  stomach  and  intestines. 

brown,  grey,  and  sometimes  greenish.  The  nose  is  blunt,  short,  and 
wide.  Lips  nearly  always  thick,  and  slightly  turned  outwards  ;  teeth 
large  or  medium,  and  of  incomparable  whiteness  and  beauty.  The 
forehead  is  low,  Hat,  and  wide ;  the  protuberance  over  the  eyebrows 
little  marked,  and  the  depression  separating  the  nose  from  the  glabella 
is  wanting  ;  mouth  large  and  wide ;  chin  square  and  massive ;  aspect  of 
the  face,  as  a  whole,  is  wide,  flat,  and  angular;  ears  always  large,  and 
standing  out.  The  body  is  very  vigorous,  sinewy,  and  squared  ;  hands 
and  feet  small ;  muscles  strong;  calf,  almost  none ;  the  legs  curved  and 
slim  ;  waist  thick  and  short ;  trunk  vigorous ;  neck  short,  but  often 
strong.  A  still  fuller  description  of  the  Kirghese,  and  of  other  Central 
Asian  races,  is  given  at  the  end  of  M.  Ujfalvy's  volumes  in  his  Tables 
of  Anthropological  measurements,  ruled  with  63  columns  for  particulars 
of  each  person  measured.

They  suffer  also  from  scurf  and  skin  diseases  at  the 
roots  of  the  hair.  Some  suppose  this  proceeds  from 
want  of  cleanliness ;  but  M.  Ujfalvy,  and  Khanlkoff 
before  him,  attribute  it  rather  to  the  constant  wearing 
of  a  sheep-skin  hat.  I  cannot  say  who  is  right,  but  I 
have  a  vivid  recollection  how,  whilst  wearing  a  native 
hat  by  night  for  warmth,  when  crossing  the  desert,  my 
head  became  singularly  heated  and  the  skin  irritated. 

In     character    the     Kii^hese    is    unsophisticated, 
honourable,  and   brave,  until   he   sees  the  chance  of 


gain  ;  and  then  he  is  prone  to  thieving.  They  are  also 
revengeful.  They  like  to  look  as  if  they  had  control 
over  their  tempers ;  but  let  their  equilibrium  be  over- 
thrown, and  then  a  terrible  fury,  little  short  of  mad- 
ness, comes  over  them.  Their  capability  of  bearing 
physical  pain  is  remarkable,  and  renders  them  in- 
sensible to  the  sufferings  of  others,  though  it  should 
be  said,  to  the  praise  of  the  women,  that  many  an 
unfortunate  prisoner  has  been  indebted  to  them  for 
an  amelioration  of  his  fate.     The  men  work  hard  only 


THE  KIRGHESE.  309 

when  necessity  presses,  domestic  labour  being  inva- 
riably left  to  the  women.  Having  food  and  raiment, 
they  are  perfectly  content,  and  prefer  idleness  to 
work.  They  are  eminently  hospitable,  and  love  to 
hear  news,  which  they  are  great  hands  at  retailing. 
The  most  trivial  event  gives  a  Kirghese  a  favourable 
opportunity  for  riding  off  to  the  nearest  aul,  or  col- 
lection of  tents,  to  relate  his  khaber,  or  intelligence,  to 
be  in  possession  of  which  is  a  passport  to  gain  the 
bearer  admission  anywhere  to  eat  and  relate  his  story. 
Some  of  his  hosts  will  then  make  their  newly-gained 
knowledge  the  excuse  for  hastening  off  to  eat  yet 
more  at  a  neighbouring  aul,  and  this  explains  the 
rapidity  with  which  news  is  disseminated  on  the  steppe.* 
The  Kirghese  are  unevenly  located  through  Central 
Asia.  Thus  in  the  province  of  Semirechia  they 
amount  to  78  per  cent  of  the  population  ;  in  the  Syr- 
daria  province  to  62  per  cent. ;  in  the  Amu-daria 
province  to  only  29  per  cent.  ;  in  Ferghana  to  not 
more  than  1 7  per  cent.  ;  and  in  the  Zarafshan  district 
to  scarcely  0*2  per  cent.  Those  in  the  mountains  may 
be  called  *'  democrats,"  testified  to  by  their  name  of 
Kara,  or  Black,  Kirghese,  which  may  be  traced  to  the 

♦  M.  Ujfalvy  contrasts  the  Kazaks  favourably  with  the  Sarts  or 
settled  people  of  Central  Asia,  and  speaks  of  the  former  as  cheerful, 
frank,  intelligent,  and  honest.  They  appear,  at  all  events,  to  keep  a 
•conscience,  for  frequent  appeals  are  made  thereto  in  the  native  courts. 
Should  an  accused  person  not  plead  guilty,  and  should  there  be  no 
judicial  proofs  of  his  guilt,  the  judge  demands  that  a  relative  of,  and 
on  good  terras  with,  the  prisoner,  chosen  by  the  plaintiff,  should  come 
forward  and  free  the  defendant  by  taking  the  oath.  If  he  consent  to 
take  the  oath  the  accused  is  free  ;  but,  on  the  other  hand,  if  he  decline, 
the  defendant  must  pay  the  penalty.  Again,  in  the  calling  of  witnesses, 
•only  a  person  of  good  conduct  is  admitted  as  a  witness  on  oath  uncon- 
ditionally. A  notorious  thief  or  a  "frivolous*'  person  may  not  take 
the  oath,  whilst  a  false  swearer  is  supposed  to  be  expelled  from  the 
community,  and  may  receive  from  25  to  40  stripes  with  the  riding-whip.

undistinguished  origin  of  their  chiefs,  the  Manaps^ 
who,  according  to  native  phraseology,  do  not  spring  of 
the  ** white  bone"  of  the  sultans.  A  Manap,  how- 
ever, enjoys  great  power,  especially  when  he  is  like- 
wise a  Batyr — that  is,  a  brave  and  dashing  leader  of 
marauding  expeditions.  Beneath  the  Manaps  are  the 
common  people,  bukhara.  Among  the  Kazaks  the 
title  of  Khan  has  been  abolished,  but  there  are  several 
who  are  called  **  sultan."  The  people  are  said  to  be 
vainglorious  in  tracing  their  genealogies,  especially 
when  they  number  a  khan  among  their  ancestors. 
Anciently  the  sultans  decided  more  important  matters 
than  were  referred  by  choice  to  honourable  elders,* 
called  '' bzzSy'  beys,  or,  further  south,  ^^^^j.  This  last 
title  was  given  to  men  of  approved  honesty,  who  to 
their  other  abilities  added  a  thorough  acquaintance 
with  their  deep-rooted  national  customs.  Under  the 
Russian  administration  the  Biis  have  been  recognized 
as  judges,  and  are  elected  by  the  people ;  but  they 
make  poor  magistrates,  and  are  open  to  corruption 
The  Russians  do  not  believe  in  them,  nor  do  the 
people  themselves. 

Some  of  the  Kirghese  poor  in  winter  live  in  holes 
or  underground  huts,  where  children  and  cattle  sleep 
and  play  together.  Others,  as  a  protection  against 
the  cold,  endeavour  to  winter  in  sheltered  places,  in 
hollows,  or  among  reeds  or  sand-dunes.  They  conceal 
their  kibitkas  in  the  reeds,  and  throw  snow  over  them,, 
so  as  to  protect  them  from  the  winds  ;  but  they  are 
now  commencing  to  build  permanent  winter  dwellings^ 
usually  of  turf  plastered  with  clay,  or  of  stone  like  the 

*  Reminding  one  of  the  "able  men,  appointed  by  Moses,**  such 
as  fear  God,  men  of  truth,  hating  covetousness  ...  to  judge  the 
people  in  very  small  matters. — Exod.  xviii.  21,  22. 


THE  KIRGHESE,  311 

huts  of  the  Caucasian  mountaineers ;  in  some  places 
even  wooden  houses  are  met  with,  but  these  have 
belonged,  for  the  most  part,  to  former  sultans.  On  the 
first  approach  of  warmer  weather  they  remove  to  their 
ordinary  habitation,  which  is  a  conical  felt  tent,  called 
a  kzbitka  or  yourt,  that  is  easily  taken  apart  or  put 
together,  and  so  light  that  a  camel  can  carry  it. 
Hence  the  nomads  wander  from  place  to  place, 
carrying  their  residence  with  them,  and  it  is  not  until 
a  rich  man  dies  that  his  body  has  for  its  habitation  a 
stone  or  earthen  building,  with  some  little  pretence  to 
architecture.  The  tomb  of  the  poor  consists  of  little 
more  than  a  funereal  mound,  but  for  the  well-to-do  is 
erected  an  edifice  surmounted  by  a  cupola,  the  wall 
•  of  the  principal  fa9ade  being  raised  above  the  rest, 
and  ornamented  with  a  battlement.  These  tombs  are 
frequently  met  with  on  the  open  steppe,  generally 
standing  alone,  and  sometimes  enclosed  by  a  wall. 
Levshine,  however,  mentions  cemeteries  where  several 
persons  are  buried,  and  R^clus,  quoting  Noschel,  says 
that  the  Kirghese  prefer  to  bury  their  dead  on  hill- 
tops, and  leave  on  the  graves  various  eatables,  and 
money.  I  saw  many  tombs  on  high  places,  but  none 
with  such  things  as  these  left  thereon,  or  on  Muham- 
madan  graves  further  south.  I  well  remember, 
however,  finding  sweetmeats,  and  coins,  in  Eastern 
Siberia,  on  the  graves  of  the  Buriats,  and  the  thought 
therefore  suggests  itself  whether  these  offerings  left 
on  certain  Kirghese  graves  are  not,  as  they  are  with 
the  Buriats,  remnants  of  Shamanism,  the  old  religion 
of  the  Mongols.  These  tombs,  and  the  ruins  here 
and  there  of  small  towns,  constitute  all  there  is 
of  Kirghese  antiquities,  few  of  which  present  any 
points   of  interest.      Levshine   mentions   upwards   of 


312  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

twenty   ruins   in   Central   Asia,  but   does  little  more 
than  specify  their  localities. 

The  Kirghese  dress  like  the  other  natives  of  Central 
Asia.  Nowadays,  those  who  are  at  all  well  off  have 
shirts,  but  the- poor  continue  to  wear  next  the  skin  their 
chapan,  as  they  call  it,  or  khalaty  closely  resembling  a 
loose  dressing-gown,  over  which  as  many  other  like 
garments  are  worn  as  the  weather  requires.  Com- 
monly the  khalat  is  made  of  cotton,  or  armiachina — 
that  is,  a  mixture  of  cotton  and  silk ;  but  for  the  rich 
they  are  made  of  silk  of  gaudy  colours,  or  even  velvet, 
which  for  grandees  is  embroidered  with  gold  and 
silver.  Some,  again,  are  of  fur — one  I  bought  in 
Bokhara  being  lined  with  jackals*  skins.  Their 
trousers,  both  for  men  and  women,  are  of  buff  or 
reddish  leather,  immensely  wide  and  baggy,  called 
chimbar,  which  are  found  to  be  so  suitable  to  the 
climate  that  the  Turkistan  soldiers  wear  them.  The 
shaven  head  of  the  Kirghese  is  first  covered  by  a 
skull-cap  called  tibetet,  and  over  this  in  summer  a 
conical  felt  hat  slit  at  the  two  ends  for  convenience  in 
turning  up  the  brim.  On  certain  occasions  the  men 
wear  tall,  steeple-crowned  hats  with  the  brim  turning 
up  in  two  immense  horns,  made  of  felt  or  of  velvet 
embroidered  with  gold.  The  foot  coverings  are 
slippers  in  summer,  and  leather  boots  in  winter,  for 
both  sexes,  those  for  women  being  coloured. 

A  Kirghese,  however,  is  proudest  of  his  girdle, 
often  richly  covered  with  silver,  and  from  which  hang 
bags,  and  wallets  for  money,  powder,  bullets,  knife, 
and  tinder  box,  or  flint  and  steel,  the  whole  apparatus 
being  called  kalta. 

The  women  dress  much  like  the  men,  except  that 
the    under-garment    resembles    a    close-fitting    shirt. 


THE  KIRGHESE,  313 

Above  this  they  wear  a  khalat.  The  poor  women 
swathe  their  heads  with  calico,  forming  a  compound 
turban  and  bib  ;  but  the  rich  wear  a  square  head-dress 
of  huge  proportions,  enveloped  in  a  white  veil  trimmed 
with  gold.*  The  hair  is  plaited  in  small  braids,  and 
adorned  with  coins  and  tinkling  ornaments.  To  these 
may  or  may  not  be  added  necklaces,  bracelets,  etc. ; 
but  there  is  one  thing  rarely  omitted  from  female 
costume,  which  is  a  silver  amulet,  hanging  from  the 
neck  in  the  form  of  a  kernel,  cylinder,  or  triangle,  and 
containing  Muhammadan  writing,  or  perhaps  prayers, 
g;iven  by  the  husband  at  the  time  of  marriage. 

The  arms  of  the  Kirghese  continue  of  a  primitive 
character,  though  contact  with  the  Russians  has  opened 
their  eyes  to  the  value  of  percussion  instead  of  flint 
muskets.  Bows  and  arrows  are  gone  out  of  use. 
Their  national  weapon  is  a  straight,  thin,  pointed 
lance,  called  a  nditay  that  on  account  of  its  length  and 
fragility  is  not  very  dangerous,  though  they  handle  it 
not  unskilfully.  To  these  weapons  may  be  added  a 
thick,  heavy  whip,  with  a  blade  or  lash  about  an  inch 
in  diameter,  a  blow  from  which  on  the  head  at  the 
hands  of  a  Kirghese  is  enough  to  kill  a  man  or  beast. 

Thus  far  it  will  be  seen  I  have  described  the  per- 
sonal characteristics  of  the  Kirghese  ;  in  the  next 
chapter  I  purpose  to  treat  of  their  social  relations. 

•  The  Kirghese  women,  I  believe,  are  never  veiled  closely,  as  with 
the  Salts,  but  they  sometimes  so  far  cover  the  face  as  almost  to  screen 
it  from  observation.  This  half-and-half  plan  seems  to  have  prevailed 
amongst  the  women  mentioned  early  in  the  Old  Testament.  Thus 
Abraham  said  to  Sarah,  "  Behold  now  I  know  that  thou  art  a  fair 
woman  to  look  upon**  (Gen.  xii.  11),  from  which  we  may  suppose 
that  Sarah  did  not  usually  wear  a  veil ;  nor  Rebekah,  when  at  the  well 
she  met  Abraham's  servant,  though  when  about  to  meet  her  future 
husband  **  she  took  a  veil  and  covered  herself**  (Gen.  xxiv.  16,  65).

THE  Kirghese  are  essentially  a  nation  of  shepherds 
and  breeders  of  cattle,  and  think  it  a  "  come- 
down "  in  life  when,  by  force  of  circumstances,  they 
are  compelled  to  resort  to  settled  occupations.  In 
such  an  extremity  they  settle  near  towns  or  villages, 
let  themselves  out  for  labourers,  as  in  the  Kalbinsk  and 
Altai  mines,  or  flock  to  the  peasant  villages  in  hay- 
time  and  harvest,  where  they  are  in  request  as  cheap 
and  energetic  workmen,*  one  result  of  which  is  that 
in  a  generation  or  two  they  become  civilized,  dress 
like  Russians,  and  call  themselves  Christians.     Others

seeking  work    near  home    or    in    the  neighbouring  government    of 
Tomsk,   29,392   passports,   varying  as  to  their  length  of  absence  as 
follows: — 17,151  for  a  month,  1,675  for  2  months,  1,873  for  3  months,.* 
7,054  for  6  months,  1,635  ^^r  a  year,  and  4  for  2  years. 


THE  KIRGHESE,  315 

turn  their  attention  to  agriculture.  These  poorer 
Kirghese  are  called  JginchdSy  and  may  be  said  to  form 
the  settled  element  of  the  Kirghese  population.* 

The  Kirghese  carry  on  their  agriculture  by  irriga- 
tion, and  it  is  worthy  of  remark  that  in  the  province 
of  Semipolatinsk,  in  1881,  the  average  harvest  gathered 
by  them  yielded  four-and-a-half  times  more  than  was 
sown,  whilst  the  Russian  agriculturists,  trusting  to 
rain  for  moisture,  reaped  in  that  year  rather  less 
than  a  three-fold  harvest.  It  should  be  remembered^ 
however,  that  the  natives  sow  large  tracts  of  millet, 
which  generally  gives  a  more  abundant  increase  than 
other  grain,  and  yielded  that  year  an  eight-fold  crop. 
The  Dikokamenni  Kirghese,  many  of  whom  are  em- 
ployed in  agriculture  at  the  eastern  extremity  of  the 
Issik-Kul,  have  rich  land,  from  which  they  get  har- 
vests yielding,  according  to  Valikhanoff,  for  millet 
seventy  and  wheat  eighty-fold.  They  cultivate  a  kind 
of  millet  (kupock),  and  distil  therefrom  a  spirit. 

Besides  the  absolutely  settled,  there  is  a  considerable 
number  of  natives  partially  settled,  whose  fields  are 
usually  at  a  distance  from  their  summer  camps  and 
winter  quarters.  These  people,  having  sown  the  land,, 
wander  away,  leaving  the  watering  and  care  of  the 
fields  to  a  few  poor  Iginchi,  often  without  family  or 
cattle,  and  at  harvest  time  return,  to  store  the  grain 
in  furrows  near  their  winter  quarters,  but  only  in 
the  quantity  necessary  for  maintenance  throughout  the 

•  In  the  Syr-daria  province  there  are  124,325  kibitkas,  or  more  than 
50,000  communes  of  these  Iginchas  engaged  in  agriculture,  their  entire 
number  throughout  Turkistan  and  Semirechia  being  reckoned  at 
300,000  souls.  In  the  province  of  Semipolatinsk,  in  1881,  the  agricul- 
turists were  nominally  16,956,  that  is  15  per  cent,  of  the  Kirghese  popu- 
lation, but  really  far  less,  since  that  number  includes  not  only  those 
immediately  engaged  in  cultivation,  but  those  also  who  help  in  harvest,, 
even  to  the  extent  of  advancing  on  loan  money  or  seed ! 


J i6  R USSIAN  CENTRAL  A  SIA . 

year,  and  for  seed,  the  surplus  being  sold,  usually  very 
cheaply,  on  the  threshing-floor.  They  cannot  retain 
any  important  reserves  of  corn  near  their  winter 
habitations,  because,  for  two-thirds  of  the  year,  the 
buildings  are  uninhabited  and  unguarded.  As  a  pre- 
caution, therefore,  against  wholesale  starvation  in  case 
of  failure  of  crops,  public  corn  stores  are  erected,  such 
as  those  in  several  volosts  in  the  Zaisan  and  Ust- 
Kamenogorsk  districts.  In  the  provinces  of  Akmolinsk 
and  Semipolatinsk,  in  1880,  there  were  91  and  69 
stores  respectively,  one  containing  27,897,  and  the 
other  6,366,  quarters  of  com.  The  poorer  Kirghese 
are  held  down  by  the  Russian  shopkeepers,  who  lend  on 
interest,  and  their  example  is  only  too  closely  followed 
by  the  rich  Kirghese,  whose  usury  is  enormous ;  not 
less,  according  to  M.  Ujfalvy,  than  cent,  per  cent,  per 
annum,  and  that  at  compound  interest;  so  that  the 
loan  of  one  sheep  has  to  be  repaid  next  year  by  two, 
or  the  next  year  four,  or  the  next  eight,  and  so  on. 

Cattle-breeding,  however,  as  I  have  said,  is  the 
normal  occupation  of  the  Kirghese,  some  of  whom  are 
said  to  possess  hundreds  of  camels,  thousands  of  horses, 
and  tens  of  thousands  of  sheep  and  goats.  They 
own,  likewise,  horned  cattle,  but  not  in  such  large 
numbers.  The  Kara-Kirghese  are  not  so  rich  as  their 
confreres  of  the  Great  and  Middle  Hordes.  Very  few 
of  the  Dikokamenni,  for  instance,  possess  as  many 
as  2,000  horses,  or  3,000  sheep.  Thd|^  keep  fewer 
camels,  but,  on  the  other  hand,  haTe  an  excellent 
breed  of  oxen,  employed  for  traversing  the  mountains. 
Their  cows  are  large,  but  yield  little  milk,  and  then 
only  just  after  calving.  Yaks,  which  they  call  Kudos, 
are  kept  by  them  instead,  since  they  yield  more  milk. 

Speaking  generally  of  the  horned  cattle  of  the  steppe.

which  are  said  not  to  have  been  introduced  amopg  the 
Kirghese  before  the  middle  of  the  eighteenth  century,. 
Dr.  Finsch  considers  that  they  contrast  favourably 
with  those  raised  in  Siberia,  since  they  are  stronger, 
and  more  imposing  in  appearance,  and  are  recognized 
among  others  by  short,  tolerably  erect  horns,  with 
small  development  of  the  belly.  In  their  colour,  as 
also  is  the  case  with  the  horses,  there  is  no  pecu- 
liarity. One  meets  with  specimens  of  sheep  black, 
white,  and  also  variegated,  whilst  a  fourth  class- 
varies  from  a  bright  to  a  dark  shade  of  cinnamon. 

The  sheep  of  the  steppe  belong  to  the  fat-tailed, 
or  rather  fat-rumped,  race,  for  the  very  short  tail 
proper  is  hidden  in  the  cushion  of  fat,  formed  below 
the  tail,  spreading  like  a  bag  over  the  upper  half 
of  the  hind  le^s.  Seen  from  the  rear,  this  lump  of 
fat  is  pear-shaped,  and  acquires,  when  the  animal  runs, 
a  trembling,  **  wobbling*'  motion  that  presents  a  comical 
appearance.  As  in  time  of  famine  the  hunch  of  the 
camel  almost  disappears,  so  it  is  with  the  fat  tails  of 
the  Kirghese  sheep.* 

More  stately  than  the  sheep  is  the  Kirghese  goat, 
which  occasionally  presents  quite  a  grand  appearance. 
The  goats  are  large,  well-built  animals,  with  short 
heads,  long  beards,  and  a  strong  development  of  chiefly 

*  It  is  quite  an  error,  Dr.  Finsch  says,  to  suppose  that  this  pecu- 
liarity of  race  disappears  by  transplantation,  for  instance,  to  Russia, 
for  it  does  so  only  by  cross-breeding  with  ordinary  sheep.  The 
Kirghese  sheep  are  of  large  size,  powerfully  built,  rather  long  legged, 
with  a  roundly  bent  nose,  and  pendent  ears.  They  attain  a  weight  of 
from  150  to  180  lbs.,  of  which  the  fat  "tail**  alone  does  not  exceed 
40  lbs.  The  fleece  is  coarse,  and  the  hairy  wool  is  therefore  less 
employed  for  spinning  than  for  making  felt.  The  horns  of  the  wether 
are  moderately  developed  with  a  bend  downwards  and  inwards,  but 
sometimes  they  assume  a  spiral  form.  The  ewes  generally  give  birth 
to  twin  lambs  in  spring,  by  which  season  the  snow  is  oif  the  ground.

white  hair,  that  falls  to  the  knee,  and  on  the  brow 
covers  the  eyes  like  a  mane.  As  with  the  sheep,  the 
ears  are  pendent.  These  goats,  however,  are  peculiar 
as  to  the  formation  of  their  horns,  which  usually  stand 
erect,  with  their  points  either  bent  inwards  towards 
each  other,  or  else  slightly  inclining  backwards.  It  is 
from  these  goats  that  the  Cossack  women  about  Troitzk 
comb  the  fine  hairs  for  making  the  kozy  pookhy  or,  as 
they  are  commonly  called,  ** Orenburg  shawls." 

Considering  the  ample  extent  of  the  Kirghese 
pasture  lands,  one  might  suppose  that  cattle-breeding 
would  be  to  them  a  highly  profitable  business,  since  it 
claims  incomparably  less  labour  than  agriculture.  It 
is,  however,  exposed  to  great  risks.  For  the  support 
of  a  nomad  family  for  a  year  are  required  1 1  head  of 
large  and  lo  of  small  cattle;  and  to  provide  hay  for  the 
winter  consumption,  even  of  this  number,  exceeds  the 
working  powers  of  one  household.  When  the  snow 
lies  loosely  and  is  not  deep,  the  larger  beasts,  and  the 
smaller  ones  behind  them,  can  get  at  the  grass ;  but 
if,  in  consequence  of  unseasonable  rains,  the  grass  is 
covered  by  a  thick  layer  of  frozen  snow  and  ice,  or  if 
the  snow  be  too  deep,  then  the  beasts  either  cannot 
obtain  food,  or  obtain  it  with  so  much  difficulty  as  to 
exhaust  them. 

Then  commences  what  the  Kii^hese  call  a  joot, 
at  which  time  a  cattle  owner  is  ready  to  give  the 
Cossacks  half  his  herd  for  as  much  hay  as  will  feed 
the  remainder  until  the  spring.  The  first  thing 
attempted  is  to  drive  the  herds  to  more  favourable 
localities,  however  distant,  or  to  put  the  beasts  to 
graze  in  the  peasant  villages.  Should  this  not  suffice, 
because  of  the  "  joot ''  extending  over  a  large  area,  the 
animals  have  to  be  slaughtered,  and  sold  for  a  song. 


THE  KIRGHESE.  319 

the  nomad's  prosperity  then  taking  wings  for  a  con- 
siderable time.  But,  in  addition  to  the  *'joot,"  the 
buran,  or  terrific  winter  snowstorm,  is  a  source  of 
very  serious  danger.  It  scatters  the  cattle,  and  then 
many  fall  down  ravines,  or  break  through  the  ice 
on  the  salt  lakes,  and  perish.  Helmersen  tells  of  a 
**buran"  in  January,  1827,  in  which  the  Middle  Horde 
lost  10,500  camels,  280,000  horses,  30,000  horned 
cattle,  and  1 20,000  sheep. 

The  Kirghese  erect  rough  sheds  of  wattle  and  daub 
for  their  cattle  in  winter,  but  even  under  the  most 
favourable  conditions  this  season  tells  heavily  on  the 
herds,  as  up  to  the  spring  they  scarcely  move  their 
legs,  and  become  so  weakened  that  many  perish  ere 
the  disappearance  of  the  snow,  and  notwithstanding 
the  growth  of  fresh  grass.* 

The  mode  of  life  of  the  Kirghese  is  necessarily 
affected  by  their  cattle-breeding,  which  requires  con- 
stant moving  about  to  find  pasture.  Nomadizing 
generally  begins  in  early  spring,  and  continues  all  the 
summer,  the  wanderers  returning  to  their  winter  camps 
in  late  autumn. 

Ordinarily  they  wander  in  small  auls,  or  collections 
of  kibitkas,  numbering  up  to  10  in  the  Orenburg 
region,  but  often  of  15  or  more  further  east.  Their 
route  depends  on  the  time  of  year  and  the  state  of  the 

♦  Valikhanoff  remarks  of  the  cattle  of  the  Kara- Kirghese  that  they 
are  never  subject  to  epidemics,  the  only  disease  attacking  them  being 
the  sarfuy  or  dry  rot,  by  which  they  generally  lose  their  hoofs.  In  the 
report  of  the  Semipolatinsk  province,  however,  it  is  said  that,  soon  after 
being  housed  for  the  winter,  the  herds  become  susceptible  of  epidemic 
disorders ;  and  although  the  year  1881  was  reported  as  generally  favour- 
able to  cattle-breeding,  yet  the  total  number  of  casualties  from  sickness, 
want  of  food,  and  snowstorms,  amounted  to  3,100  camels,  15,000 
horses,  7,600  homed  cattle,  and  70,400  sheep,  besides  56,000  cattle 
destroyed  by  wolves,  so  that  the  total  loss  was  152,000  head,  or  rather 
more  than  2  per  cent,  of  all  the  cattle  in  the  province. 


320  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

grass,  but,  generally  speaking,  up  to  the  middle  of 
the  summer,  it  is  further  and  further  from  the 
winter  quarters,  to  which  they  return  by  stages  in 
autumn.  The  winter  pasturages  are  often  by  the 
shores  of  lakes,  from  which  the  herdsmen  are  driven 
in  April  or  May  by  the  drought  and  insects.  They 
then  ascend  the  rich  mountain  slopes  with  their  flocks,, 
leaving  the  camels  behind  to  shift  for  themselves, 
unwatched,  feeding  on  the  salt  soil  herbage.  We  saw 
several  apparently  thus  left.  In  July  or  August  the 
men  descend  to  gather  their  crops,  and  then  pay 
another  visit  to  the  mountains  before  winter,  to  gather 
the  later  harvest  there.  In  the  Orenburg  district,  if 
the  grass  is  good,  the  summer  nomads  are  distributed 
pretty  equally  over  the  whole  steppe  ;  but  if  there  is 
drought  in  the  south,  then  masses  of  Kirghese,  in 
their  search  for  grass  and  water,  proceed  to  the 
extreme  north  of  the  steppe,  a  distance  of  600  or  700 
miles  from  their  winter  quarters  on  the  Syr-daria. 

These  wanderings  the  Kirghese  call  perokochevka^ 
and  they  are  thus  conducted.  The  pasture  in  the 
neighbourhood  being  exhausted,  first  by  the  camels 
biting  off  the  tops  of  the  grassy  stems,  followed  by  the 
horses,  which  gnaw  the  grass  closer,  and  the  sheep, 
which  nibble  it  down  to  the  roots,  one  or  two  of  the 
mounted  young  men  are  sent  from  the  aul  to  select  a 
suitable  spot  for  a  new  encampment,  and  to  clear  out 
the  wells.  This  done,  the  women  pack  the  kibitkas, 
the  head  of  the  household  merely  looking  on,  whilst 
the  other  men  form  the  cattle  into  droves.  The  camp 
is  packed,  and  starts  before  dawn,  the  good  woman  of 
the  family  riding  in  front.  We  met  one  old  lady  in 
this  honourable  position,  mounted  astride  a  bullock, 
and  looking  anything  but  graceful.  After  her  came  the

.Other  women ;  one  young  girl,  I  remember,  sitting  on  a 
horse  covered  with  a  gay  saddle-cloth,  and  wearing 
her  best  clothes,  as  is  usual  on  such  occasions.  On 
the  camels  are  packed  carpets,  samovars,   tents,  etc., 


the  whole  being  made  to  wear  a  festive  aspect.  Since 
all  the  cattle  do  not  move  at  the  same  pace,  the  herds 
soon  straggle,  so  that  a  moving  aul  may  occupy  a 
ler^th  of  several  miles.     Generally  speaking,  the  men 


322  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

during  a  march  ride  somewhere  off  the  road,  or  go 
hunting.  The  length  of  a  stage  is  from  13  to  17 
miles,  having  done  which  they  rest  awhile,  as  also  on 
summer  afternoons,  for  an  hour.  The  aul  then  again 
moves  forward,  traversing  about  25  miles  in  24  hours. 

When  stationary,  the  herds  are  milked  in  the  early 
morning,  and  are  driven  to  their  pasture  by  mounted 
shepherds,  who  bring  them  back  in  the  evening. 
Cows,  sheep,  and  goats  are  milked  morning  and 
evening  only,  but  mares  three  times  a  day,  or  oftener, 
in  which  latter  case  only  a  small  quantity  is  given  at 
each  time.  The  lambs  and  kids  are  sometimes  penned 
in  extempore  folds,  or  wander  near  the  auly  guarded 
by  children,  who  not  unfrequently  make  companions 
of  them  inside  the  tents  also. 

Among  the  Kirghese  the  practice  of  polygamy 
obtains ;  but  since  the  maintenance  of  wives  and  the 
money  given  to  parents  for  their  purchase  are  burden- 
some, the  poorest  Kirghese  usually  restrict  themselves 
to  one  wife.  Some  have  two  or  three,  and  the  rich 
four.  Generally  the  eldest  brother  of  a  family  has 
more  than  one.  The  first  wife  is  mistress  of  the 
household,  and  is  called  baibicfie.  To  her  are  subject 
not  only  her  husband's  other  wives,  but  also  all  the 
other  females  of  the  family.  The  head  of  a  household 
will  often  send  a  portion  of  his  herds  several  hundreds 
of  miles  away  under  the  care  of  this  wife,  whilst  he 
himself  will  either  remain  with  his  other  wives  about 
the  grazing  ground,  or  go  and  encamp  somewhere  by 
himself.     In  winter  the  family  comes  together  again. 

The  manifold  circumstances  connected  with  marriage 
among  the  Kirghese  are  somewhat  formidable.  It  is 
a  custom  for  men,  even  before  they  are  fathers,  to 
strengthen  the  bonds  of  friendship  by  agreeing  to  a 


THE  KIRGHESE,  323 

marriage  between  their  future  offspring,  so  that  many  a 
couple  are  **  engaged  "  before  they  are  born,  though  it 
frequently  happens,  of  course,  that  such  arrangements 
are  broken  through.  Fifteen  is  the  marriageable  age, 
and  preliminaries  are  commenced  by  the  parents  of  the 
bridegroom  selecting  from  three  to  ten  kinsmen,  or 
friends,  as  matchmakers,  called  kouda4usser,  who  pro- 
ceed to  the  parents  of  the  bride,  offering  presents,  and 
among  them  a  dish  specially  prepared  for  the  occasion 
of  liver  and  mutton  fat,  called  konyruk-baour,  which 
signifies  that  they  "  mean  matrimony,"  after  which  the 
compliment  is  returned  by  presents  and  a  similar  dish, 
sent  by  the  girl's  parents  to  those  of  the  bridegroom. 
These  gifts  are  called  kiet.  The  bride's  father  then 
calls  together  his  kinsmen,  to  decide  the  kaltm,  or 
gross  amount  to  be  paid  for  the  bride.  Also  a  mullah 
should  be  present  to  ask  three  times  of  the  parents  or 
relations  contracting  the  union,  **  Do  you  consent  to 
unite  your  children  ?  *'  and  then  to  read  prayers  for 
the  happiness  of  the  future  couple  in  the  presence  of 
witnesses,  or  of  umpires,  chosen  to  settle  differences, 
should  any  arise  between  the  parties  making  the  con- 
tract. The  kalim  may  be  40,  60,  or  120  sheep,  or 
9>  I7»  27,  37,  or  47  head  of  cattle,  according  to  the 
means  of  the  bridegroom  or  kouladar,  Levshine  men- 
tions in  his  day,  for  the  poor  5  or  6  sheep,  and  even 
less ;  but  with  the  rich,  up  to  200  horses,  and  from  500 
to  1,000  sheep,  also  cattle,  valuable  effects,  and  some- 
times male  and  female  slaves.  Besides  the  kalim,  the 
bridegroom  has  to  give  presents  called  bash-yakshi 
(good  head),  and  ayak-yakshi  (good  feet),  that  is,  either 
nine  camels,  or  one  camel,  a  horse,  a  cow,  and  a  fire- 
arm ;  or,  if  the  man  be  poor,  the  bash-yakshi  takes  the 
form   of   I    or  2  camels,  with  a  horse,  and  the  ayak- 


324  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

yakshi  of  a  horse,  cow,  and  k/talats.  These  things 
settled,  the  bride^s  father  sends  to  the  bridegroom's  aul 
for  the  kalim,  or  two-thirds  of  it,  and  one  of  the  yakshi, 
after  which  the  bridegroom,  having  fed  the  bride's 
messengers,  takes  the  other  yakshi,  generally  the  bash- 
yakshi,  that  is  called  the  '' ilu^'  and  goes  to  see  the 
bride  for  the  first  time.  The  delivery  of  the  ilu  has 
great  importance,  in  that  it  virtually  closes  the  bridal 
contract — so  securely,  indeed,  that,  should  the  bride- 
groom die  thereupon,  the  girl  has  to  go  to  his  parents. 
In  some  places,  before  the  bridegroom  starts,  his 
father  gives  a  family  feast,  clothes  the  youth  with  a 
rich  robe,  mounts  him  on  a  good  horse^  with  the  best 
of  saddles  and  harness,  and  sends  him  away  after  a 
mullah's  prayers  for  the  traveller  s  safety.  Arrived  at 
the  bride  s  aul,  the  young  man  states  his  business,  and 
asks  permission  of  her  father  to  pitch  his  white  tent. 
This  he  does  for  about  three  days,  during  which  he 
gains  over  the  women  by  presents  to  procure  for  him  a 
private  interview  with  his  betrothed.  The  two  now 
see  each  other  for  the  first  time,  perhaps ;  but  since 
the  kalim  and  the  ilu  have  been  paid,  the  contract  is 
virtually  closed,  and  neither  can  draw  back  without 
some  little  difficulty.  The  interview  is  commonly  by 
night,  and  supposed  to  be  kept  secret  from  the  parents, 
to  whom  the  bridegroom  gives  more  presents  for  the 
right  of  visiting  his  betrothed  by  day.  That  to  the 
bride's  mother  in  return  for  some  milk  is  called  sut-uk, 
that  to  the  father,  tui-ntal,  this  latter  including  what  is 
necessary  for  the  marriage  feast,  and  among  the  rich 
amounting  sometimes  to  fifty  or  a  hundred  horses, 
which  are,  however,  on  the  completion  of  the  marriage, 
returned  to  the  bridegroom  as  the  present  of  the  bride. 
After  this  first  visit  the  custom  of  some   localities  is 


THE  KIRGHESE.  325 

for  the  bridegroom  to  keep  his  white  tent  at  the 
bride's  aul  for  his  courting  visits,  which  of  course 
are  turned  into  festive  occasions.  In  other  localities 
he  may  not  return  until  the  kalim  is  paid  and  the  mar- 
riage is  agreed  upon.  Hence  the  period  of  betrothal 
is  sometimes  prolonged  to  a  year  or  more. 

If  during  this  period  the  betrothed  girl  should  die, 
her  parents  are  bound  to  give  instead  their  next 
-daughter,  or,  in  default  of  one,  to  return  the  kalim, 
and  pay  also  a  fine  of  one  or  two  horses  and  khalats, 
or  furs.  So  also,  if  the  girl  should  refuse  to  marry, 
which  she  may  do  on  account  of  a  suitor's  ill-health,  his 
bad  conduct,  or  poverty,  or  even,  as  allowed  in  some 
localities,  her  personsJ  dislike.  If  the  bridegroom 
or  bride  should  die,  inquiry  is  made  as  to  whether 
between  the  betrothed  there  had  been  improper  inti- 
macy. If  so,  in  the  first  case,  only  half  the  kalim  is 
returned,  and  in  the  second  case,  when  the  first  daughter 
has  died,  and  the  next  is  provided,  the  bridegroom  has 
to  add  to  the  kalim.  Should  their  conduct,  however, 
have  been  irreproachable,  four-fifths  of  the  kalim  are 
returned,  the  girl's  parents  retaining  from  four  to  nine 
horses.  Yet  another  custom  is,  that  if  the  bridegroom 
die,  or  refuse  to  marry  the  girl,  his  parents  are  bound 
to  take  her  for  their  next  son,  paying  a  fine — usually  a 
camel — in  case  of  refusal.  Should  there  be  no  brothers, 
the  kalim  has  to  be  returned,  subject  to  the  limitations 
just  alluded  to.  In  cases  of  double  marriages,  where 
brother  and  sister  marry  sister  and  brother  respectively, 
the  kalim  is  omitted. 

When  the  prescribed  period  of  betrothal  is  at  an 
end,  the  bridegroom,  dressed  and  mounted  at  his  best, 
goes  with  friends  to  the  aul  of  the  bride,  where  a 
kibitka  has  been  prepared  for  his  reception.    Through-

out  the  ceremonies  of  betrothal,  the  bride's  brother  has 
the  right  of  pilfering  from  the  bridegroom  whatever  he 
pleases.  But  now  the  bride's  relations  come  and  take 
as  presents  almost  everything  he  has  :  his  coat,  hat, 
girdle,  horse,  saddle,  etc.,  pleading  that  they  are  for 
the  education  of  the  bride — a  seizure  that  is  afterwards 
balanced  by  the  relations  of  the  bridegroom  on  the  visit 
to  their  aul  of  the  relations  of  the  bride.  The  bride  & 
parents  are  bound  to  give  up  the  bride  when  the  kalim 
is  paid,  giving  her  in  dowry  a  kibitka,  a  camel,  or 
riding-horse,  and  cattle,  also  a  bride's  head-dress,  called 
saoukeU,  or,  if  poor,  another  kind,  called  jaoulouk^ 
besides  a  bed,  crockery,  and  a  trunk  of  wearing  appareL 
Whilst  this  **trousseau"  is  in  preparation,  the  brides- 
maids gather  towards  evening  to  dress  the  bride  and 
to  sing  songs,  and,  all  being  ready,  the  happy  couple,, 
richly  clad  when  possible,  are  led  into  their  tent  for  the 
final  ceremony.  The  mullah  places  them  in  the  midst^ 
puts  before  them  a  cup  filled  with  water  and  covered 
with  a  cloth,  and  begins  the  prayers.  Then  he  asks 
the  contracting  parties  if  it  is  with  their  full  consent 
they  engage  themselves  in  the  bonds  of  matrimony,  and 
gives  them  three  times  the  water  to  drink,  offering  the 
remainder  to  the  bystanders,  or,  if  they  are  numerous,, 
sprinkling  them  therewith.*  Some  mullahs  put  in 
the  water-vessel  an  arrow,  with  a  tuft  of  hair  tied 
to  it  from  the  mane  of  the  bride's  horse, f  or  one  of 
her  ribbons  ;  others  dip  therein  a  paper  of  written 
prayers.    This  ceremony  over,  for  the  girl's  head-dress, 

*  With  this  may  be  compared  the  custom  at  the  marriage  ceremony 
in  the  Russian  Church  of  the  bride  and  bridegroom  draining  alter- 
nately a  cup  of  wine  or  water. 

t  This  has  a  resemblance  to  Shamanism  as  practised  by  the  Buriats,. 
who,  if  they  have  nothing  better  to  leave  on  a  grave  they  pass,  cut 
off  and  fasten  near  a  piece  of  their  horse's  tail.

worn  thus  far  by  the  bride,  is  substituted  that  of  a  woman, 
her  friends  singing  the  while.  In  some  districts,  the 
husband  then  comes  on  horseback  to  the  door  and  asks 
permission  to  enter.  This  being  refused,  he  obtrudes,  as 
it  were,  by  force,  and  takes  her  away  to  a  private  tent* 
The  happy  completion  of  a  marriage  is  followed 
among  the  Kirghese  by  feasting  and  games  ;  and  when 
the  newly-married  are  about  to  depart,  the  whole  aul 
assembles;  the  father  puts  his  daughter  on  her  horse, 
which  he  leads  to  the  side  of  her  husband,  and  they 
depart,  amid  women's  tears  and  men's  farewells,  with 
the  camels  carrying  the  trousseau,  and  the  portion  of 
his  wealth  which  a  father  gives  to  each  of  his  daughters 
on  her  marriage.  On  arriving  at  the  husband's  aul,  his 
father  gives  a  feast.  Close  at  hand  is  pitched  the 
new  wife's  tent,  wherein  are  displayed  all  the  articles 
of  her  trousseau.  These  are  seized,  according  as  they 
please,  by  her  new  relatives,  who  are  greedy  of  presents, 
they  giving  others,  but  usually  of  less  value,  in  return. 
The  bride,  having  thus  made  her  ddbut,  if  she  wishes 
to  show  her  activity,  rises  very  early  during  the  first 
few  days  after  her  arrival,  to  uncover  the  top  of  the 
tents  of  her  husband's  parents.  She  retains  her  own 
tent  t  and  trousseau  :  and  even  her  cattle  brought  in 

*  In  other  districts  the  bridesmaids,  after  the  ceremony,  lead  the 
bride  to  the  same  white  tent  where  she  first  saw  her  husband,  leave  her 
there,  and,  later  on,  fasten  to  the  tent  a  gaily-saddled  horse  and  a  robe. 
In  the  morning,  the  happy  husband,  under  ordinary  circumstances,  dons 
the  robe,  springs  on  the  horse,  and  hurries  triumphantly  to  receive  the 
felicitations  of  his  father-in-law  and  friends  ;  but  if  the  wife  has  proved 
unchaste,  he  has  the  right  to  kill  the  horse,  to  tear  the  robe,  and  to 
hack  the  tent  with  his  sword,  after  which  he  may  exact  from  the  father 
either  the  kalitn  or  another  of  his  daughters  without  further  payment. 
This  custom,  Levshine  says,  half  a  centur>'  ago  was  dying  out,  but  it 
may  be  compared,  in  passing,  with  the  law  of  the  Hebrews  recorded  in 
Deut.  xxii.  13 — 21.

dower  a  wise  husband  does  not  mix  with  those  of 
his  other  wives,  because  they  descend  to  her  children 
only,  and  not  to  other  children  of  the  husband. 

Thus  it  will  be  seen  that  marriage  a  la  Kirghese  is, 
if  committed  only  once,  a  somewhat  expensive  business, 
whilst  for  each  repetition  of  the  process  the  amount  of 
the  kalint  rises  higher.  The  whole  affair  has  much  of 
the  nature  of  a  civil  contract,  of  which  I  imagine  the 
woman  generally  gets  the  worse.  Equality  of  position 
is  sought  by  the  parents,  rather  than  suitability  as  to 
age  and  temperament ;  and  "  woman's  rights  *'  cfiez  les 
Kirghese  are  few  enough.  In  some  districts,  it  is  true, 
a  woman,  when  she  attains  the  age  of  twenty-three, 
may  marry  a  husband  of  her  own  choice ;  but  at  that 
period  of  life,  in  the  steppe,  she  is  considered  to  have 
passed  the  flower  of  her  age.  Again,  in  case  of  ill- 
treatment  by  a  husband,  a  wife  may  complain  to  a  Biy 
who  will  probably  get  the  man  to  promise  to  keep 
the  peace,  or  condemn  him  to  be  flogged. 

Marriage  among  the  Kirghese  may  be  dissolved 
in  two  ways:  by  separation  or  divorce,  either  of 
which  usually  raises  the  kalim  as  a  bone  of  con- 
tention. For  separation,  the  following  are  admis- 
sible causes — (i)  Mutual  agreement.  The  husband 
permits  his  wife  to  marry  another  man  on  condition 
that  he  receives  a  kalim  and  costs.  The  document 
drawn  up  for  this  agreement  is  called  talag-kagaz,  a 
**  paper  of  separation."  (Like  the  fiiPXiov  dirooTaa-LoVy 
or  **  bill  of  divorcement  of  Isaiah  1.  i  ;  Mark  x.  4.) 
Should  the  wife  return  to  her  parents,  the  father  is 
bound  to  return  to  the  husband  half  the  kalim  paid  for 
her,  and  the  other  half  on  the  moment  of  her  marrying 

Sarah's  tent,"  and  how  Laban  entered  Jacob's  tent,  and  Leah's  tent, 
and  Rachel's  tent  (Gen.  xxiv.  67,  and  xxxi.  ^t^.

again.  (2)  For  a  certain  sum  paid  to  him,  or  her 
dowry,  the  husband  may  give  a  paper  of  separation 
at  the  wife  s  request.  So,  likewise,  (3)  the  husband, 
ceasing  to  care  for  the  wife  (as  in  Deut.  xxiv.  i),  may 
give  her  to  another  man  for  a  kaltm.  This  looks, 
according  to  Kozloff,  as  if  the  woman's  consent  were 
not  necessary  ;  but  I  was  told  further  south,  in  Bokhara, 
that  a  man  could  not  ordinarily  put  away  his  wife, 
-except  by  her  consent.  (4)  Should  no  kaltm  have 
been  paid  for  her,  a  wife  is  at  liberty  to  leave  her 
husband.  (5)  Disrespect  on  the  part  of  a  wife  justifies  a 
husband  in  sending  her  away,  after  having  supplied  her 
with  a  portion  of  her  dowry,  and  a  khalat,  and  mount- 
ing her  upon  a  horse.  (6)  So  in  the  event  of  the 
wife's  adulter)',  in  which  case  the  man  retains  the 
•dowry.  Should  a  wife  appeal  successfully  to  a  Kirghese 
court  for  permission  to  leave  her  husband,  the  judges 
usually  grant  her  thirty  days  in  which  to  marry 
another.  Failing  to  do  this  she  is  bound  to  return 
to  her  husband. 

The  marriage  contract  may  be  terminated  by  divorce, 
•on  the  plea  of  poverty,  minority  of  the  parties,  the 
husband's  cruelty,  or  physical  incapacity ;  in  which 
<:ases  the  wife  may  marry  her  brother-in-law,  or  whom 
she  pleases,  and  retain  her  dowry,  but  her  future 
husband  must  pay  a  kaltm  to  the  first.  In  former 
days  the  Kirghese  were  strict  in  their  observance 
of  what  the  Jews  called  yebamotk^  or  levirate 
marriage,  that  if  a  man's  brother  die,  and  leave  a 
widow,  his  eldest  brother  should  take  the  widow  ; 
but  nowadays  the  custom  is  dying  out,  and  though 
the  widow  remains  with  her  husband's  relations, 
she  is  no  longer  compelled  to  marry  one  of  them,  or 
indeed  to  remarry  at  all.     I  remember  seeing  a  Kir- 


330  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

ghese  widow  come  in  a  supplicating  manner  to  a  Russian 
civil  authority,  begging  that  she  might  not  be  forced 
to  marry  her  brother-in-law,  to  which  she  was  averse  ; 
but,  then,  so  was  she  also  averse  to  giving  up  the 
kalim ;  the  Kirghese  law  being,  in  such  a  case,  that 
if  she  were  childless,  and  wished  to  remain  single, 
she  could  retain  only  a  portion  of  her  husbands 
property,  though  if  she  had  children  she  might  keep 
the  whole.  Should  a  widow  marry  a  man  in  her  late 
husband's  tribe,  other  than  her  brother-in-law,  the  man 
has  to  pay  her  brother-in-law  a  fine,  varying  from  a 
horse  and  khalat  up  to  nine  head  of  cattle,  for  the  slight 
done  him  by  her  preferring  another  to  himself;  and  in 
the  event  of  her  marrying  a  stranger,  she  loses  her 
dowry,  which  her  deceased  husband's  relatives  retain, 
and  her  children  are  left  as  wards  of  the  said  relatives^ 
who  are  also  bound  to  look  after  her  cattle. 

This  brings  us  to  the  Kirghese  laws  concerning 
inheritance,  that  are  said  to  have  caused  formerly  much 
contention  after  a  father's  death.  A  father  now  divides 
his  inheritance,  as  a  rule,  during  life*  amongst  his 
grown-up  sons,  either  on  their  marriage  or  soon  after, 
care  being  taken  that  the  children  only  receive  the 
portion  that  comes  to  them  from  their  own  mother, 
and  not  that  of  the  other  wives.  Such  a  division  is 
made  verbally  in  the  presence  of  dignitaries,  or  it  may 
be  confirmed  by  a  signature  witnessed  by  them,  f 

I    have  thus  entered  somewhat  fully  into  the  Kir- 

*  As  did  Abraham  (Gen.  xxv.  5,  6). 

t  It  is  not  necessary,  moreover,  that  only  children  inherit  a  man's 
property,  for  faithful  servants  may  be  included,  who  have  looked  after 
the  cattle,  or  watched  the  interests  of  the  family.  Abraham  said :  '*  The 
steward  of  my  house  is  this  Eliezer,  of  Damascus  ,  .  .  and  lo,  one  bom  in 
my  house  is  mine  heir"  (Gen.  xv.  3,  4).  When  the  division  is  made, 
the  wife  receives  one-fourth  of  the  fortune,  with  the  warning  that  she  is 
not  to  squander  it,  since  at  her  death  it  reverts  to  her  husband.     Should 


THE  KIRGHESE,  331 

ghese  laws  respecting  marriage,  family  rights,  the 
relation  between  man  and  wife,  inheritance  and  division 
of  property,  partly  because  I  have  not  seen  them 
treated  elsewhere  so  systematically  and  so  fully  in 
English,  and  partly  because  these  customs  of  the 
steppe  illustrate  at  so  many  points  the  pastoral  life 
of  the  Hebrew  patriarchs,*  under  which  latter  I  shall 

she  outlive  him,  however,  she  keeps  this  share.  As  a  rule,  a  father  will 
leave  his  real  property  to  his  eldest  son,  but  his  doing  so  is  quite 
optional.  A  childless  widow  receives  one-eighth  of  the  property  on  her 
husband's  death,  the  residue  going  to  his  brothers  or  other  relatives 
down  to  the  fifth  generation  ;  but  if  the  man  leave  children,  the  property 
is  divided  amongst  them,  the  daughters  receiving  the  seventh  part,  and 
the  sons  the  residue. 

•  Thus  in  Gen.  xxiv.  we  see  the  eldest  servant  of  Abraham's  house 
acting  the  part  of  what  the  Kirghese  would  call  a  kouda-tnsser ^  or 
matchmaker,  in  seeking  for  Isaac  a  wife,  and  taking  with  him  ten 
camels,  a  portion  certainly  of  whose  burden  consisted,  if  not  oi^  kalintf 
yet  of  presents  of  silver  and  gold,  and  clothing,  which  he  gave  not  only 
to  the  bride,  but  also  to  her  mother  and  brother.  So  again,  in 
Gen.  xxxiv.,  the  Hivite  prince,  Hamor,  acts  a  similar  part  on  behalf  of 
his  son  in  proposing  a  marriage  with  Dinah  the  daughter  of  Jacob. 
Further,  the  young  man  Shechem  recognizes  the  propriety  of  a  kalitn 
and  presents,  saying,  "Ask  me  never  so  much  dowry  and  gift" 
(|FID^  nrfO),  the  former  word,  in  each  of  the  three  cases  where  it  occurs 
n  the  Old  Testament,  being  always  used  in  connection  with  marriage, 
and  the  latter  word  for  a  gift  generally.  The  custom  obtained  also  at 
the  time  of  the  promulgation  of  the  law,  in  which  we  read  (Exod.  xxii.  17), 
of  **  the  dowry  of  virgins,"  and  which  evidently  had  not  disappeared  in 
the  days  of  David,  who,  thinking  too  humbly  of  himself  to  become  a 
king's  son-in-law,  was  told  "the  king  desireth  not  any  dowry."  So 
again,  one  thinks,  of  course,  of  the  question  of  the  Sadducees  (Mark  xii. 
19,  and  Luke  xx.  28):  "Master,  Moses  wrote  unto  us.  If  any  man's 
brother  die,  having  a  wife,  and  he  die  without  children,  that  his  brother 
should  take  his  wife,  and  raise  up  seed  unto  his  brother."  But  though 
Moses  wrote  this  (in  Deut.  xxv.  5),  the  custom  had  existed  as  far  back 
as  the  days  of  Judah,  the  great-grandson  of  Abraham,  whose  two  sons, 
Er  and  Onan,  were  successively  husbands  of  Tamar,  who  afterwards 
waited  for  a  third  son,  Shelah.  The  interesting  question  therefore  arises, 
whence  this  custom  was  introduced  among  the  Kirghese  ?t  A  somewhat 

t  The  practice  is  common  enough,  I  believe,  among  Muhammadan  peoples  ;  but  if 
the  Kirghese  received  it  from  the  Koran,  one  would  expeci  to  find  them  observing 
other  laws  from  the  same  source,  regulating  intercourse  between  the  sexes.    In  many

now  be  able  to  point  out  further  illustrations  in  things 
that  came  under  my  own  observation. 

bold  suggestion  has  presented  itself  to  my  mind,  which  I  put  forward 
not  as  a  theory,  but  as  a  suggestion  only,  that  when  Abraham  dismissed 
his  wife  Keturah's  sons  (Gen.  xxv.  i — 6),  giving  them  gifts,  and  sending 
them  away  from  Isaac  **  eastward  unto  the  east  country,"  they  may 
very  well  have  taken  the  custom  to,  or  learnt  it  in,  the  land  of  Chaldea, 
whence  Abraham  came,  and  from  whence  it  might  have  spread  further 
east  beyond  the  Oxus  and  Jaxartes  to  the  north  of  Central  Asia.  The 
distance  from  the  Ur  of  the  Chaldees  to  the  Jaxartes  would  be  easily 
covered  in  two  summers*  wanderings.  Whether  this  suggestion  involves 
any  anachronisms  or  contradictions  I  know  not ;  but,  if  true,  it  seems 
to  confirm  my  idea,  that  in  the  Kirghese  steppe  one  sees  perhaps  the 
type  in  the  present  day  most  nearly  resembling  the  oldest  pastoral  life 
recorded  in  the  pages  of  history. 

cases  of  assault  upon  women,  under  the  Jewish  law,  the  offender  or  offenders  were 
put  to  death ;  and  such  is  the  punishment  to  this  day  for  prostitution  and  adultery 
in  Bokhara,  where  the  Muhammadan  law  is  in  full  force  ;  whereas  among  the  Kirghese 
this  class  of  offences  is  punished  by  fine  only.

I  EXPRESSED  to  the  authorities  in  Semirechia 
my  wish  to  visit  a  Kirghese  aul,  whereupon  M. 
Troitzky,  the  Pomoshnik-uyezdi-nachalnik,  or  assistant 
chief  of  the  Vierny  district,  kindly  promised  to  further 
my  wishes  if  I  would  meet  him  a  day's  journey  in 
the  wilderness  at  Suigati,  where  he  was  to  hold  a 
meeting  of  Kirghese  representatives  assembled  to 
elect  their  bis  or  judges.  On  our  arriving  there  the 
smiles  of  the  post-master  told  us  we  were  expected, 
and  we  made  for  M.  Troitzky's  tent.  It  was  an  un- 
usually grand  one,  measuring  9  paces  in  diameter, 
with  the  roof  supported  by  1 20  rods.  This  the  reader 
will  better  appreciate  if  I  describe  how  a  Kirghese 
tent  is  erected.  I  chanced  in  the  Hi  valley  to  see  a 
woman  begin  to  put  up  her  tent,  and  so  interested  was 


334  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

I  that  I   would  not  stir  from  the  spot  till,  note-book 
in  hand,  I  had  witnessed  the  whole  operation. 

The  component  parts  of  a  kibitka  are  felt  and 
matting,  wherewith  to  cover  a  framework  that  consists 
of  a  lintel  and  side-posts  for  a  door,  and  pieces  of 
trellis-work,  surmounted  by  poles  fastened  to  a  central 
corona.  A  piece  of  the  trellis-work  {called  kiriga,  as  I 
took  down  the  name  phonetically  from  the  woman's 
mouth)  resembles  a  pair  of  lazy-tongs,  or,  better  still, 


an  English  child's  toy  on  which  he  moves  his  little 
company  of  soldiers,  the  wooden  laths  or  poles  forming 
the  trellis  being  fastened  with  a  leather  thong  where 
they  cross.  Four  of  these  kiriga,  tied  together 
and  expanded  so  as  to  stand  about  4  feet  high, 
made,  with  the  doorway,  a  circle  about  6  paces  in 
diameter,  and  the  whole  was  girded  by  a  broad  band 
of  worsted.  Then  was  hoisted,  perhaps  9  feet  high, 
over  the  centre,  a  wooden  hoop,  called  chunrukh, 
to  serve  as  chimney   ventilator,  and  window,  into  the 


THE  KIRGHESE,  335 

holes  of  which  were  thrust  the  ends  of  long  wooden 
staves  called  ookh,  the  other  ends  being  tied  to  the 
trellis- work,  so  that,  when  the  woman  had  tied  55 
of  these  ookh,  the  framework  of  her  small  tent  was 
ready.  Huge  pieces  of  felt  were  then  hoisted  to  the 
top  on  poles,  and  drawn  to  their  position  by  two  bands 
called  bau,  and  afterwards  fastened  ;  the  covering  for 
the  doorway  being  hung  from  the  lintel  like  a  curtain. 
The  felts  did  not  quite  reach  the  ground,  fresh  air  on 
this  occasion  being  a  desideratum  ;  but  there  were 
placed  on  the  grass  two  pieces  of  reed  matting  called 
tchi,  fastened  inside  and  encircling  the  tent  to  the 
height  perhaps  of  4  feet,  a  binding  line  being  tied 
round  to  keep  all  taut.  Besides  this,  ropes  made  of 
horses'  manes  hung  from  the  hoop  or  corona  inside  to 
keep  the  tent  down,  and  outside  a  stake  was  driven 
into  the  ground  to  windward  for  similar  security.  The 
floor  was  strewn  with  felts,  a  space  being  left  in  the 
centre  for  the  fire. 

A  small  tent  such  as  that  I  saw  erected  would  cost, 

when    new,  from    50J.    to   60^.,   and   one  of  ordinary 

size  about  ;^5.      In  this  case  it  was  being  put  up  for 

hire   at    \2s.  a  month.     A  large   show-tent,  such   as 

that  provided   for    M.    Troitzky,     would    cost ';^  100; 

for   this    last    was    12    feet   high   in   the   centre,    the 

felt    was    lined    with    silk,    and    the    floor   and   sides 

strewn  and  hung  with  carpets.      It  was  the  property  of 

Nogai  Bi,  one  of  the  judges,  who  had  provided  it  for 

the  occasion.     I  have  said  that  in  the  roof  were  1 20 

poles,  or  staves,  each  of  which  I   was  told  in  Vierny 

represented  a  sapling  from  the  forest,  and  not  merely 

a  piece  cut  from  a  block  of  timber.       M.  von  Ghern, 

in    fact,  said   that    the   Kirghese  take    for    making    a 

yourt  from  200  to  400  young  saplings,  and  since  in 


336  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

the  district  of  Vierny  alone  there  are  40,000  yourts^ 
it  is  not  matter  for  surprise  that  the  country  is  bare  of 
wood. 

But  we  were  to  be  conducted  to  an  aul  to  see  a  tent 
in   working   order.     They   mounted  us  on   Kirghese 
horses,  the  first  peculiarity  of  which   I  discovered  to 
be  that  to  stop  my  steed  I  pulled  one  rein  instead  of 
two.     We  set  off  with  perhaps   a   score   or   two   of 
natives,    who   seemed  to    be    coming  for    the  fun   of 
the  thing,   our  way  lying  along   a  valley   flanked  by 
low   undulating  hills,  on  which  there  was   not  to  be 
seen   a   tree   of  the  smallest   dimensions.     **  What  is 
that }  "  said  I,  pointing  to  a  pile  of  stones,  heaped  on 
an   eminence.     **Oh!''   said    they,    **  a   notable   man 
recently   died,  and  when  a  large   number  of  people 
were  gathered  at  the  feast  that  followed  his  funeral^ 
we  raised  the  heap  on  that  day  to  his  memory."  * 

Arrived  at  the  aul,  we  entered  the  first  tent,  the 
owner  of  which  made  me  welcome,  and  I  began  to 
make  note  of  my  surroundings.  On  the  trellis-work 
were  hung  all  sorts  of  suspendible  things — basins^ 
bags,  harness,  firearms,  leather  bottles,  skins,  clothes, 
and  a  Kalmuk  bass,  or  box  in  which  to  put  cups  and 
basins,  to  be  slung  on  the  back  of  a  camel.  Behind 
me  were  rolls  of  felt,  cushions,  carpets,  and  trunks 
full  of  effects,  one  box  of  Russian  manufacture,  with 
a  good  deal  of  metal  thereon,  being  pointed  out  as 
something  worthy  of  remark,  the  like  to  which  is 
found  only  in  the  tents  of  the  rich.  In  the  middle 
of  the  tent  a  huge  open  saucepan  does  duty  as  the 
principal,    if    not    the    only,    cooking   utensil,    whilst 

*  A  living  illustration,  I  thought,  of  patriarchal  times,  when  Laban 
and  Jacob's  brethren  made  a  heap  of  stones  for  a  memorial  between 
them,  and  ate  thereon ;  or  when  Joshua  pitched  twelve  memorial  stones 
in  Gilgal  (Gen.  xxxi.  46,  and  Josh.  iv.  20). 


THE  KIRGHESE,  n: 

around  this  stand  kurgans  or  ewers  of  metal  some- 
thing like  an  English  coffee-pot,  and  curious  pails  made 
of  leather,  sometimes  having  a  spout.  I  caught  sight, 
moreover,  of  a  curious  staff,  the  size  of  a  broom- 
handle,  inlaid  with  brass  and  steel,  with  an  ornamented 
top,  2  spans  long  and  i^  round,  that  was  used  to  stir 
the  kumiss. 

Some  of  this  drink  was  offered  us  in  a  basin,  and 
for  the  first  time  I  tasted  soured  mares'  milk.  My 
teetotal  conscience  led  me  to  ask  first  whether  it 
was  intoxicating,  and  I  was  told  **  No."  On  the  other 
hand,  I  certainly  have  read  that  a  certain  alcoholic 
drink  is  prepared  from  mares*  milk.  Perhaps  it 
becomes  so  when  distilled,  or  when  old  and  further 
fermented,  in  which  last-mentioned  condition  they 
said  it  acquired  astringent  properties,  whereas  when 
new  it  is  aperient.  I  detected  nothing  alcoholic  in 
its  taste,  and  liked  it  fairly  well.  Sevier  pronounced 
it  much  the  same  as  Scotch  buttermilk.  I  can  imagine 
a  thirsty  traveller  in  summer  coming  in  from  the  steppe 
enjoying  a  basin  to  quench  his  thirst ;  but  it  was  not 
nice  to  sip.  Moreover,  the  fact  that  one  is  not  accus- 
tomed to  drink  i  mares'  milk,  and  the  thought  that  the 
beverage  had  possibly  been  in  the  dreadful  leather 
bottle,  that  is  said  never  to  be  washed,  was  not  appe- 
tizing to  an  English  palate.  Besides  kumiss,  they 
brought  another  drink  called  airan,  or  curdled 
milk  of  cows,  ewes,  and  goats,  with  water — mixed,  I 
presume,  for  economy's  sake,  since  they  said  that  the 
rich  drank  cows'  milk  alone.  They  likewise  offered 
dough  nuts,  made  of  flour  and  mutton  fat,  but  no 
bread,  for  they  live  upon  the  flesh  of  their  animals, 
fresh  or  smoke-dried,  in  winter,  and  on  their  milk  only, 
generally  fermented,  in  summer.     They  make  also  a

kind  of  cheese,  called  irimtchik,  from  cows'  and  ewes' 
milk. 

How  little  corn  is  consumed  by  the  nomads  may  be 
judged  from  the  Semipolatinsk  report  for  1 88 1 ,  which 
states  that,  whilst  every  settled  agricultural  family  in 
the  province  raised  22  bushels,  each  nomad  family 
raised  only  4  bushels.*  Sometimes  they  boil  meal 
and  salt,  sometimes  butter  and  fat,  in  their  tea,  and 
they  showed  me  in  the  tent  a  small  seed  called /r(;^(7, 
that  is  made  into  gruel,  or  bruised  and  eaten  when 
milk  fails  in  winter,  and  upon  which  the  very  poor 
were  said  to  live  entirely.  They  make  of  this  grain 
likewise  a  sort  of  beer,  called  buza^  the  effect  of  which, 
Dr.  Schuyler  says,  is  immediately  to  stupefy  and  deaden 
the  senses  rather  than  to  inebriate ;  but  they  told  me  in 
the  tent  that  it  not  only  made  the  consumer  drunk  at 
once,  but  that  the  same  result  followed  on  his  drinking 
water  the  next  day. 

I  am  not  aware  that  the  Kirghese  have  any  stated 
hours  for  meals.  They  can  go  without  drink  for  a 
whole  day,  and  without  food  for  several  days,  and 
then  love  to  gorge  themselves  to  repletion.  At  their 
great  feasts  they  indulge  in  horse  flesh,  but  their  usual 
meat  is  mutton.  Some  of  the  extravagant  Russian 
officers,  who  go  to  Central  Asia  to  repair  their  fortunes, 
and  are  supposed  to  have  been  accustomed  to  the  best 
cuisines  in  Petersburg,  declare  that  nothing  can  excel 
the  Kirghese  cooking  of  mutton,  which  I  can  so  far 
confirm  that,  when  we  entered  a  second  tent  in  the 

•  The  Kirghese,  however,  chiefly  those  in  Karkaralinsk  and  Pavlodar, 
bought  besides,  from  the  provinces  of  Tomsk  and  Semirechia,  14,187 
tons  of  wheat  and  rye.  When  they  do  use  com  food  it  is  almost 
exclusively  in  the  form  of  gruel,  prepared  by  boiling,  in  milk  and  water 
unground  com  till  it  is  soft.  This  method  continues  even  in  localities 
where  Kirghese  agriculture  is  well  developed. 


THE  KIRGHESE.  339 

aul,  and  they  brought  us  a  dish  of  this  meat  boiled, 
we  found  it  very  good. 

It  was  much  greater  fun,  however,  to  be  spectators 
than  partakers  of  the  feast.  We  had  entered  the 
second  tent  a  numerous  body,  and  had  placed  ourselves, 
as  I  supposed,  anyhow.  But  it  was  pointed  out  to  me 
that  I  had  been  seated  in  the  place  of  honour  opposite 
the  door,  whilst  my  vis-d-vis,  a  few  feet  off,  was  my 
host,  who  had  for  the  occasion  taken  the  position  of 
her  who  would  have  been  his  wife  in  attendance,  had 
he  been  dining  en  famille.  On  my  left  sat  a  sultan 
{who  formerly  had  been  chief  in  these  parts),  and  four 
others  of  note  ;  on  my  right  were  seven  bis,  and  in 
front  some  aristocratic  youths;  whilst  in  the  outer 
circle,  *'  below  the  salt "  and  standing,  was  a  crowd  of 
lookers-on.  Accordingly,  when  the  meat  was  brought, 
the  dishes  were  put  before  us  according  to  our 
supposed  rank  ;  one  to  myself,  Mr.  Sevier,  and  the 
Russian  officer ;  another  to  the  sultans*  party  ;  a  third 
for  the  judges  ;  and  so  on.  I  heard  nothing  of  **grace 
before  meat,"  but,  dishes  placed,  I  never  saw  anything 
to  exceed  the  alacrity  with  which  they  were  cleared. 
Hands  were  knives,  and  fingers  were  forks,  the  meat 
being  torn  from  the  bones  as  by  the  teeth  of  hungry 
dogs.  On  such  occasions  as  this,  it  is  a  piece  of 
Kirghese  politeness  for  a  superior  or  an  elder  to  take 
a  handful  of  pieces  of  meat  from  his  dish  and  stuff 
them  into  the  mouth  of  an  inferior  or  younger  guest 
— an  elegancy  I  saw  practised  on  another,  but  which, 
I  suppose,  my  position  precluded  being  exercised  on 
myself. 

After  the  meal,  as  also  before,  an  attendant  brought 
round  a  basin  and  ewer  for  all  to  wash  their  hands  ; 
and  although  there  was  room  for  doubt  whether  one's 


340  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

fingers  were  the  cleaner  before  or  after  using  the 
grimy  cloth  intended  for  a  towel,  yet  remembering 
that  in  the  New  Testament  times  forks  were  not 
invented,  and  that  equals  then  ate  with  their  fingers 
out  of  one  and  the  same  dish,  I  confess  that  seeing  the 
custom  in  the  Kirghese  tent  led  me  rather  to  sympa- 
thize with  the  Pharisees,  to  a  degree  I  had  not 
previously  done,  in  their  observance  of  the  custom 
when  they  came  from  the  market,  of  not  eating  except 
they  had  first  washed  their  hands  (Mark  vii.  3  ; 
Luke  xi.  38).* 

Dessert  in  the  desert  comes  before  instead  of  after 
meat,  and  on  this  occasion  consisted  of  apples,  dried 
apricots,  pistachio  nuts,  raisins,  and  walnuts.  Feasting 
over,  I  continued  to  apply  myself  to  getting  informa- 
tion. My  inquisitiveness  in  the  first  tent  led  me  to 
ask  what  was  behind  some  straw  matting  I  saw,  and 
I  was  told  **a  store  closet,''  and  a  similar  inquiry 
in  the  second  tent  as  to  what  was  behind  a  curtain 
elicited  the  fact  that  it  was  the  husband's  sleeping  place, 
that  was  shared  with  him  by  one  of  his  wives,  the 
wife  or,  wives  left  out  in  the  cold  sleeping  on  the 
opposite  side  of  the  tent.  This  brought  on  the  tapis 
topics  matrimonial,  in  the  discussion  of  which  it 
transpired  that  my  host  had  two  wives,  the  sultan 
on  my  left  had  three,  and  the  one  next  him  four, 
whilst  they  informed  me  that  some  had  five  or  six  ; 

*  Our  location  in  the  tent  likewise,  and  serving  of  classes  apart,  was 
so  far  reminiscent  of  Joseph  dining  with  his  brethren,  that  they  set  on  for 
him  by  himself,  and  for  them  by  themselves,  and  for  the  Egyptians  by 
themselves.  They  set  also  before  him  the  firstborn  according  to  his 
birthright,  and  the  youngest  according  to  his  youth.  Also  Joseph's 
sending  messes  to  his  hroiYvers  from  before  him  is  something  like,  but 
an  improvement  upon,  the  delicate  attention  of  superior  to  inferior  to 
which  I  have  just  alluded  (Gen.  xliii.  32 — ^34). 


THE  KIRGHESE.  341 

and  then  came  out  the  surprising  intelligence  to  them 
that  I  had  none,  which  seemed  to  exercise  them  greatly, 
for  they  subsequently  asked  how  it  was  I  had  no 
wives,  whilst  **  these  boys  here,"  said  they,  **  has  each 
of  them  a  wife  ! " 

After  having  peppered  them  with  questions,  I 
thought  it  only  fair  to  give  them  a  turn,  and  I  there- 
fore inquired,  in  a  vainglorious  moment,  whether  they 
would  like  to  question  me.  Shoemaker  like,  they 
began  to  talk  of  **  leather,'*  and  asked  whether  in  my 
country  we  had  cattle,  horses,  camels,  and  cows.  This 
I  was  able  to  answer  with  confidence,  and  though  not 
very  well  posted  in  Smithfield  prices,  I  thought  if  I 
told  them  that  our  cows  cost  ;^20  each  it  would  surprise 
them.  And  so  it  did,  but  the  answer  led  to  another 
question  that  utterly  non-plussed  me,  for  they  wanted 
to  know  how  much  milk  a  twenty-pound  cow  would 
give  in  a  day !  Had  I  known  the  correct  quantity, 
it  would  have  been  difficult  for  me  to  have  translated  it 
extempore  into  a  Russian  standard  ;  and  as  for  Kirghese 
measures — well,  I  doubt  if  they  have  any.  We  there- 
fore proceeded  to  the  **  next  question,"  which  was 
whether  we  had  nomads  in  England  who  were  judged 
by  bis  ?  also  whether  the  English  and  Russians  were 
ruled  by  the  same  Emperor,  and  if  not,  were  we 
neighbours  and  friends  ?  to  which  I  was  pleased  to  be 
able  to  reply  that  though  we  were  not  under  the  same 
Emperor,  and  could  hardly  be  called  neighbours,  yet 
that  we  certainly  were  friends. 

I  now  asked  for  a  song,  which  was  no  sooner  begun 
than  some  women  put  their  heads  in  at  the  door,  and 
we  soon  had  a  full  house.* 

♦  The  poetry  of  the  Kirghese,  according  to  M.  Gotobitzky,  is  now 
in  that  stage  of  development  where  any  and  every  literary  creation  is 


342  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

On  the  occasion  of  my  visit  none  of  the  women 
sang,  but  two  men  exercised  their  powers  by  extem- 
porizing a  song  aimed  at  the  judges,  the  burden  of 
which  was  that  formerly  their  bis  were  chosen  with 
reference  to  age  and  integrity,  whereas  now  it  was 
solely  for  pelf;  and  this  hit  was  emphasized  by  the 
comparison  of  a  lion  and  a  mouse,  to  show  that  ignoble 
persons  were  chosen  to  office  instead  of  the  mighty. 
Others  of  their  sentiments  were  that  **  a  man  who 
rides  one  horse  can  also  lead  another  "  ;  that  "  a  bear 
is  as  strong  as  a  lion  "  ;  and  that  **  he  cares  little  for  a 
good  horse  who  feeds  him  badly.''  I  asked  if  they 
would  like  to  hear  an   English  song,  and  gave  them 

still  the  heritage  of  a  people  at  large,  and  not  of  a  chosen  few.  With- 
out mannerism  or  literary  effect,  their  songs  strike  one  at  times  by  their 
real  poetic  beauty,  joined  to  artistic  simplicity  and  truth.  The  Kir- 
ghese  are  fond  of  singing,  and  one  may  often  hear  a  solitary  horseman 
during  his  long  rides  thus  beguiling  his  time,  modulating  his  voice  by 
holding  his  hand  to  his  mouth  and  withdrawing  it  alternately ;  or, 
on  approaching  an  aul,  the  words  of  a  widow  may  fall  on  the  ear, 
soliloquizing  somewhat  thus :  **  There  was  a  time  when  my  protector, 
the  source  of  all  my  happiness,  was  alive,  when  his  handsome  figure 
was  seen  on  a  velvety  steed — when  I  was  not  solitary !  No  traveller 
then,  whether  sultan  or  Kazak,  rich  or  poor,  ever  passed  the  aul  with- 
out visiting  our  kibitka,  whilst  I,  anxious  to  please  him  who  was  the 
best  among  riders,  ordered  my  servants  and  looked  to  the  comfort  of 
his  guest.  We  were  esteemed  by  all,  and  he  who  now  calls  himself 
'  master '  has  more  than  once  held  the  bridle  of  my  lord  and  husband's 
horse.  Times  are  changed — a  sorry  horse  outruns  a  noble  charger. 
Who  will  care  now  to  visit  me,  the  solitary  one  ?  " 

All  the  Kirghese,  especially  the  young  men,  have  a  keen  apprecia- 
tion of  singing  and  improvisation,  and  hold  those  who  possess  such 
g^ifts  in  esteem.  No  young  girl  commands  such  admiration  of  men 
as  one  who  is  clever  at  singing  repartee,  and  no  men  are  so  liked  by 
the  Kirghese  girls  as  a  good  and  able  otliantcht\  or  professional 
singer.  Dramatic  poetry  in  the  Steppe  is  still  in  its  infancy,  the  theme 
being  frequently  cast  into  the  form  of  a  dialogue.  The  singer  not  un- 
frequently  prefaces  the  song  with  an  introduction,  giving  the  dramatis 
personcB.  The  subject  is  generally  a  contest  at  wit— a  conversa- 
tion between  a  man  and  a  woman.  Riddles  are  given  and  intricate 
questions  proposed,  which  have  to  be  cleverly  solved,  and  answered,. 


THE  KIRGHESE.  343 

'*God  Save  the  Queen,"  whereupon  I  was  not  a  little 
pleased  to  find  that,  though  they  knew  nothing  of 
England,  nor  whether  I  was,  with  the  Russians,  a 
fellow-subject  of  the  Tsar,  yet  they  had  heard  of 
Queen  Victoria,  and  asked  about  the  Heir  Apparent. 

I  took  occasion  in  this  tent  to  inquire  respecting 
their  religion,  concerning  which  Levshine  says  that  it 
is  difficult  to  decide  whether  it  be  Muhammadan, 
Pagan,  or  Manichean.  All  recognize  a  supreme 
Creator, but  some  worship  Him  according  to  the  Koran; 
others  mix  their  Islamism  with  remains  of  ancient 
idolatry,  whilst  others  believe  that  besides  a  beneficent 
God,  whom  they  call  Khoda,  there  exists  an  evil- 
doing  spirit  called  Shaitan,  which  name  I  remember 
our  Kirghese  drivers  used  when  seemingly  they  were 
swearing.* 

or  a  tangle  is  the  consequence.  This  termination  of  the  conflict  is 
generally  made  to  fall  to  the  lot  of  the  gentleman  who,  as  the  song  will 
have  it,  has  been  educated  at  Bokhara,  and  enters  into  conversation 
with  a  young  girl  whom  he  admires.  He  is  thoroughly  beaten,  and  the 
telling  hits  of  his  fair  opponent  against  his  khanship,  dignity,  and 
white  turban,  are  not  unfrequently  returned  with  the  loss  of  temper  and 
abusive  expressions. 

*  Veniukoff  speaks  of  the  religion  of  the  Dikokamenni  Kirghese 
as  Islamism,  which,  however,  he  says,  is  very  superficial  (as  Bishop 
Alexander  told  me  in  Viemy),  particularly  among  the  tribes  adjacent 
to  China,  some  not  knowing  even  the  name  of  their  prophet,  much  less 
the  99  names  of  the  Deity.  Of  the  five  periods  of  prayer  they  observe 
only  those  of  the  morning  and  evening,  and  to  the  fasts  the  Kir- 
ghese in  general  have  a  decided  objection  as  leading  to  subsequent 
gluttony  and  indigestion.  Some  customs,  too,  of  Shamanism,  Veniukoff 
says,  are  retained  among  the  people,  some  of  the  Kara-Kirghese 
worshipping  fire  on  Thursday  nights,  prayers  being  read  if  a  literate 
person  be  present,  during  which  the  worshippers  remain  prostrate. 
The  fact  is  that  the  Kirghese  have  very  little  religion  of  any  sort,  and, 
as  Kostenko  says,  if  asked  what  form  of  religious  creed  they  hold,  they 
do  not  themselves  always  quite  know.  Some  Russians  do  not  scruple 
to  say  that,  so  far  as  the  Kirghese  are  Muhammadans,  the  orthodox 
Russian  Government,  by  paying  mullahs  and  erecting  mosques  in  the 
Steppe,  has  made  them  so,  thoujgch  Kostenko  adds  that  the  Government 


344  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

In  the  Russian  registers,  the  Kirghese  are  entered 
as  Muhammadans,  and  regarded  as  Sunnis ;  for 
though  many  of  them  have  only  a  very  confused 
notion  as  to  the  two  sections  of  Muhummadanism 
called  Sunni  and  Shia,  yet  they  so  far  espouse  the 
cause  of  the  Sunnis  that  they  consider  every  one  else 
an  infidel,  be  he  Shia,  Buddhist,  or  Christian.  Also 
their  religious  indifference  seems  to  be  preserved  only 
so  long  as  they  do  not  come  in  contact  with  people 
more  civilized  than  themselves,  on  which  occasions 
they  are  sometimes  fanatical.  M.  Troitzky,  who 
took  me  to  the  tent,  told  me  that,  some  time  before, 
the  Kirghese  had  been  on  the  eve  of  an  outbreak, 
because  the  Government,  wishing  to  take  a  census, 
had  distributed  amongst  the  auls  tablets  or  cards  to  be 
marked  so  as  to  show  the  number  of  the  people.  On 
these  tablets,  however,  the  Kirghese  discovered  a 
device,  whether  the  Imperial  two-headed  eagle  or  what 
else  similar  I  know  not ;  but  thinking  it  to  be  intended 
to  make  them  Christians,  they  were  almost  ready  to 
mutiny.  It  was  the  knowledge  of  this,  I  suppose, 
that  led  the  Russians  to  warn  me  against  the  distri- 
bution of  the  Scriptures  in  the  Steppe. 

I  had  not  forgotten  the  exhortation,  but  finding  that 
my  host  could  read,  I  asked  if  he  would  accept  a  copy 
of  the  New  Testament,  telling  him  it  was  the  best 
book  we  had  in  England.  He  took  it  joyfully,  and 
was  evidently  pleased   to  get  it.     I    then  asked  what 

no  longer  concerns  itself  to  appoint  Kirghese  mullahs  or  build  mosques. 
How  little  respect  some  have  for  the  creed  of  Islam  may  be  judged 
from  an  incident  recorded  by  Gotobitzky,  who  says  that  the  Muham- 
madan  rule  of  faith  never  has  existed  among  the  Kirghese,  and  in 
support  of  which  he  states  that  on  one  occasion,  at  Akmolinsk,  a  Kir- 
ghese was  called  upon  to  take  his  oath  on  the  Koran  and  to  kiss  the 
book,  whereupon  he  snatched  the  volume  out  of  the  mullah's  hand, 
struck  him  on  the  head  with  it,  and  subsequently  tore  it. 


THE  KIRGHESE.  345 

they  thought  became  of  us  after  death  ?  Upon  which 
they  replied  that  God  had  made  good  angels,  called 
Mankir,  and  bad  angels,  called,  Nankir,  though  when 
He  made  them  their  books  did  not  say,  and  that  two 
of  these  angels  sit  invisibly  on  the  shoulders  of  every 
man  from  his  birth,  Mankir  being  always  on  the  right. 
Further,  that  they  see  all  the  man  does,  and  write  the 
good  and  bad  in  their  respective  books,  which  at  death 
are  both  taken  to  God,  who  decides  whether  the  good 
or  ill  preponderates,  and  gives  sentence  accordingly ; 
the  bad  being  sent  into  the  fire,  and  the  others  to  the 
enjoyment  of  another  life  in  the  world  of  spirits,  where 
the  good  find  all  that  they  can  desire. 

It  was  then  my  turn  to  tell  them  the  Christian 
creed ;  how  for  the  putting  away  of  man's  sin  Jesus 
Christ  came  into  the  world  and  made  atonement 
on  our  behalf,  offering  us  freely  the  benefit  of  what 
He  has  done ;  and  then,  by  way  of  showing  them 
how  thoroughly  I  believed  in  this,  I  went  on  to  say 
that  I  had  travelled  some  thousands  of  versts  to  spread 
this  news,  in  doing  which  I  had  distributed  more 
than  100,000  publications.  I  hoped,  therefore,  that 
they  would  read  the  book  I  was  leaving,  and  that  we 
might  hereafter  meet  again.  How  much  they  appre 
hended  of  what  I  said  I  am  not  at  all  sure,  for  I  spoke 
in  French  to  M.  Troitzky,  who  turned  my  speech 
into  Russian,  and  then  communicated  it  through  his 
Kirghese  interpreter  ;  and  the  reply  travelled  back  to 
me,  by  the  same  channel,  to  the  effect  that  we  all  come 
from  one  Parent,  that  God  is  merciful,  and  that  for  a 
little  good  in  us  He  pardons  the  evil.  I  tried  to  trace 
this  pardoning  love  to  Jesus  Christ,  whereupon  one  of 
them  brought  forward  a  Muhammadan  book,  in  which 
the  Christian  prophet  was  spoken  of.     This  was  all 


346  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

done  with  perfect  good  temper,  and  apparently  without 
offence,  but  I  was  told  afterwards  that  Nogai  Bi,  who 
had  accompanied  us,  was  a  fanatic,  and  often  harboured 
in  his  dwelling  hodjas,  or  religious  pilgrims,  who  have 
been  to  Mecca,  and  who,  when  discovered  by  the 
Russians,  are  sent  about  their  business,  because  of 
their  evil  political  influence,  and  because  they  fleece 
the  people. 

What  little  religious  knowledge  the  Kirghese  have 
is  kept  alive  by  mullahs,  who  go  from  aul  to  aul, 
assisting  at  marriages  and  at  the  burial  of  the  dead ; 
but  very  often  their  services  are  dispensed  with, 
because  the  civil  ceremony  is  the  principal  part  of 
Kirghese  wedlock,  whilst  the  poor  for  funerals  cannot 
afford  the  expense.  Amongst  these  mullahs  are 
some  who  have  received  a  certain  religious  educa- 
tion at  Samarkand  or  Bokhara.  These  enjoy  the 
respect  of  the  people,  but  the  majority  are  pitifully 
ignorant,  and  lazy  to  a  degree  ;  they  take  advantage 
of  a  credulous  race,  and  resort  to  sorcery  and  kindred 
devices. 

Having  finished  our  visit  to  the  aul,  we  returned  to 
the  stately  tent  of  M.  Troitzky  to  find  it  surrounded 
with  a  crowd  of  Kirghese,  who  had  come  to  the  place 
for  a  popular  election.  The  Russians  have,  to  a  very 
large  extent,  left  the  Kirghese  to  maintain  order  among 
themselves  by  the  exercise  of  their  own  patriarchal 
laws.  The  judge  is  chosen  by  the  people,  and  trials 
are  oral  and  public,  conducted  according  to  con- 
science, relations  being  defended  by  relations.  Thus 
every  important  case  becomes  a  public  matter,  and 
popularly  judged,  its  brightest  features  being  the 
frequent  appeals  made  to  the  consciences  of  the  con- 
tending parties,  and   the  spirit  of  reconciliation  that 


^  THE  KIRGHESE,  347 

generally  accompanies  the  verdict.  A  marked  feature 
in  the  transaction  is  the  importance  attached  by  the 
Kirghese  to  an  oath.  They  call  lijan-beru,  or  ** giving 
one's  soul."  * 

Concerning  judgment  and  judges,  every  volost  or 
district  has  to  select  from  4  to  8  bzSy  each  of  whom  may 
decide  cases  not  involving  more  than  £ioA 

Thus  I  had  arrived  at  Suigati  on  an  important 
occasion,  for  the  Kirghese  had  assembled  for  the  pur- 
pose of  electing  not  merely  judges,  etc.,  but  a  volostnoi 
nachalniky  or  chief  of  the  volost,  whose  office  is  a  paid 
one,  whilst  the  bis  are  unpaid.  On  such  occasions  a 
representative,  called  in  Russ  a  piatedestatnik,  or 
fiftieth,  is  sent  by  every  50  tents  throughout  the 
volost.    Their  office  it  is  to  choose  a  bi  for  every  200 

♦  The  Kirghese  idea  of  what  constitutes  a  crime  is  an3rthing  but  a 
legal  one,  and  they  are  quite  unable  to  distinguish  between  criminal  and 
civil  law.  Thus  thefts  are  hardly  considered  criminal.  *'  So-and-so," 
they  say,  '*  has  stolen  a  horse,  and  has  not  returned  it."  But  as  such 
matters  are  considered  purely  personal,  they  are,  in  most  cases,  settled 
privately  among  themselves,  there  being  scarcely  a  scale  oi punishment 
for  such  offences,  but  of  fines,  varying  from  a  chapan,  or  coat,  to  a 
koutn,  that  consists  of  1,000  rams,  100  horses,  or  50  camels.  This  last 
fine  used  to  be  imposed  in  earlier  times  for  murders — half  a  koum  for 
a  woman,  the  whole  koum  for  a  man.  Other  cases,  such  as  offences 
against  a  man*s  honour,  blows,  robbery,  dishonesty,  etc.,  are  punished 
by  the  following  scale  : — 

1.  Chapan,  or  a  khalat,  or  coat,  of  stuff  or  fur. 

2.  At'Chapany  or  a  horse  and  khalat  (for  trifling  offences,  etc.). 

3.  Mouinouke-Koussak,  Kbumx)une'Terkan,  which  means  that  when 

a  stolen  animal  is  restored,  two  others  have  to  be  returned  with 
it,  tied  to  the  head  and  tail  of  each  other. 

4.  TogouSy  or  nine  head  of  cattle  (for  violence,  fraud,  etc.). 

5.  From  tV  to  I  of  a  koum  (for  various  bodily  hurts). 

Of  late  years  fines  in  money  have  also  come  in  vogue;  confinement  for 
periods  varying  from  3  to  30  days  ;  and  birching,  up  to  25  stripes,  the 
last  being  inflicted  for  offences  against  order  and  decency,  refusing 
supplies  in  time  of  war,  resisting  authorities,  but  not  being  applicable 
to  the  aged  or  to  children, 
t  Everything  exceeding  that  limit  must  be  settled  by  a  meeting  of

kibitkas,  as  also  a  volostnoi,  or  chief  of  the  volost. 
The  first  thing  to  be  done  on  the  present  occasion  was 
to  call  these  representatives  from  out  of  the  crowd  by 
name,  the  bis  severally  testifying  as  to  their  identity. 

M.  Troitzky  then  asked  the  representatives,  of  whom 
there  were  27,  and  all  sitting  in  front  of  his  tent  door, 
how  much  they  would  pay  their  chief  per  annum. 
Three  hundred  roubles  was  the  sum  first  proposed, 
and  then  500,  with  some  dissentients,  who  were 
requested  to  rise,  and  who  did  so  to  the  number  of  5 
only.  Five  hundred  roubles,  or  ;^50,  being  carried, 
they  were  asked  how  much  they  would  allow  the  chief 
for  his  mullah,  or  secretary,  and  how  much  for  his 
djiguitt,  or  mounted  messenger,  whereupon  they  voted 
;^6  for  each.  The  emoluments  of  the  office  being 
settled,  they  proceeded  to  elect  the  officer,  M. 
Troitzky  first  reminding  them  that  the  office  would 
be  held  for  three  years,  and  that  they  should,  therefore, 
be  careful  to  choose  a  good  man  A  table  was  placed 
at  the  door  of  the  tent,  and  on  it  two  hats  half  covered 
with    handkerchiefs,    to   prevent   the   contents    being 

bis  from  different  volosts,  to  be  convened  periodically,  besides  which 
the  contending  parties  may,  if  they  please,  appeal  to  a  Russian 
tribunal,  whose  decision  is  regarded  as  from  a  third  court,  and  must 
be  final.  In  conducting  a  case,  the  accused  and  accuser  choose 
their  own  bi  or  bis^  and  thje  litigants  bind  themselves  by  a  written 
promise  to  the  head  of  the  volost  to  abide  by  their  decision.  This 
is  accompanied  in  the  Orenburg  district  by  a  custom  of  the  litigants 
throwing  down  their  whips  at  the  feet  of  the  judges,  as  a  token  that 
they  deliver  themselves  up  to  be  dealt  with  as  they  may  deserve. 
No  objection  can  be  received  against  a  judge  after  the  verdict  is 
given,  and  any  one  uttering  a  false  suspicion  against  a  judge  is  liable 
to  the  fine  of  a  khalat  for  defamation.  On  the  other  hand,  should  a 
judge  impose  a  fine  on  unjust  grounds,  he  is  deprived  of  his  position. 
A  judge  is  answerable  to  God  for  a  prejudiced  verdict,  which  has  this 
much  of  meaning,  that  if  a  bi  be  found  to  have  been  bribed  to  give  an 
unfair  verdict,  custom  subjects  him  to  popular  indignation  and  depriva- 
tion of  office. 


THE  KIRGHESE,  34^ 

seen,  whilst  before  it,  in  a  semicircle,  were  seated  the 
27  representatives,  to  each  of  whom  was  given  a  nut, 
to  be  placed  in  the  receptacle  for  ayes  or  noes.     M. 
Troitzky  told  me  that  on  a  previous  occasion  he  had 
endeavoured  to  ensure  privacy  of  voting  by  having 
two  basins  for  ayes  and  noes  put  in  his  tent,  but  that 
some  of  the  rascals  had  taken  the  nuts  from  one  basin 
to  place  in  the  other.     The  names  of  four  candidates 
were  proposed,  and  on  the  first  being  named,  aged  48, 
all  gave  **their  pebble"  for  him  but  three;  in  the  case  of 
the  second  candidate  the  numbers  were   exactly  re- 
versed ;    the  third  candidate  secured  2 1  votes  in  his 
favour,  but  the  fourth  only  7,  the  election  ending  in 
favour  of  Nogai  Bi,  who,  according  to  old-fashioned 
Kirghese  custom,   ought  to  have  been,  like  a  bride- 
groom, nearly  stripped,  then  and  there,  by  congratula- 
tory friends  of  everything  upon  him,  and  his  belongings 
seized  by  one  and  another  as  a  keepsake.     But  he  was 
a  rich  man,  and  powerfully  built,  and  when  they  sur- 
rounded him  with  congratulations  his  demeanour  soon 
showed  that  he  personally  thought  the  custom  more 
honoured  in  the  breach  than  in  the  observance. 

Thus  ended  this  part  of  the  day's  proceedings,  and 
we  were  taken  into  the  tent  for  refreshment  and  to 
talk  over  what  we  had  seen.  It  was  very  clear  that 
M.  Troitzky  had  no  sinecure,  for  he  was  single-handed 
in  so  far  that  he  had  no  Russian  help,  but  only  that  of 
one  or  two  Kirghese  interpreters.  In  his  uyezd  there 
were  25  volosts,  containing  in  all  40,000  tents.  All 
these  he  had  to  inscribe,  and  to  help  choose  their 
officers.  He  was  telling  us  of  his  multifarious  duties, 
when  he  was  suddenly  called  to  action  by  some  one 
rushing  into  the  tent,  saying  that  there  was  a  fight 
going  on. 


350  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Now  the  Kirghese  laws  concerning  personal  offences 
are  better  defined  than  some  others.  Thus,  to  insult 
a  senior  has  to  be  atoned  for  by  the  fine  of  a  khalat, 
or  bowing  to  the  ground  to  ask  pardon.  To  insult  an 
equal  entails  having  to  ask  forgiveness  only,  and  abuse 
behind  a  person's  back  does  not  count,  but  naughty 
children  are  punished  as  the  parents  may  desire.* 

In  the  present  instance  M.  Troitzky  quickly  left 
the  tent,  and  I  wondered  what  gentle  methods  of 
persuasion  he,  the  only  European  there  be  it  remem- 
bered except  ourselves,  would  use  to  pacify  the  two 
combatants,  surrounded  as  they  were  by  hundreds  of 
these  Kazaks,  whose  very  name  bespeaks  .  them 
ruffians.  Would  he  place  himself  between,  and  entreat 
them  to  be  reconciled  }  Not  a  bit  of  it !  I  left  the 
tent  a  minute  later  to  see  what  he  would  do,  when 
behold !  he  had  sprung  upon  his  horse,  rushed  into 
the  crowd,  and,  whip  in  hand,  was  dealing  out  blows 
right  and  left,  and  scattering  the  crowd  like  a  pack 
of  curs.  His  interpreters  followed  suit,  and  so 
speedily  had  everyone  taken  to  his  heels,  that  it  was 

*  Cases  of  assault  are  punishable  by  fines,  to  which  is  added,  in 
serious  cases,  the  defraying  of  the  suiferer's  medical  expenses  ;  whilst 
disturbance  of  the  peace,  offences  against  order,  or  resistance  to 
authorities  may  be  visited  not  only  with  a  fine,  but  25  stripes  with 
the  rod.  Certain  of  the  Kirghese  laws  concerning  criminal  assaults 
are  very  like  those  of  the  Hebrews.  Thus,  a  person  committing  an 
offence  against  an  unbetrothed  maid  is  obliged  to  many  her,  with 
the  consent  of  her  parents,  who  may  demand,  besides  the  kalint^ 
9  head  of  cattle  for  the  dishonour  inflicted  on  their  daughter,  which 
practically  is  similar  to  the  Jewish  law,  recorded  in  Exod.  xxii.  16, 
and  Deut.  xxvi.  28,  29.  In  other  cases,  however,  as  I  have  ob- 
served before,  the  Kirghese  law  is  much  less  severe  than  the  Jewish 
code,  or  even  the  Muhammadan  law,  as  enforced  in  Bokhara.  Thus, 
an  offender  against  a  betrothed  maid  may  atone  for  his  crime  by  paying 
from  27  to  45  cattle  to  the  bridegroom  elect ;  and  should  the  bridegroom 
refuse  to  go  on  with  his  marriage,  the  offender,  in  Turkistan  at  least, 
must  pay  a  kalim  and  take  the  girl  to  wife.     In  the  case  of  the  seduc- 


THE  KIRGHESE.  351 

not  easy  to  find  the  combatants.  M.  Troitzky  then 
returned  to  the  tent,  having  given  orders  that  the  man 
who  began  the  quarrel  should  be  brought  to  him. 
One  was  led  forward,  shaking  in  his  shoes,  and 
declaring  that  it  was  not  he  who  povoked  the  quarrel, 
whereupon  the  Russian  officer  adroitly  answered, 
**  Very  well ;  then  go  and  find  me  the  man  who  did !  " 
which  he  left  the  tent  to  do,  whilst  we  went  on  our 
way  towards  Aulie-Ata,  the  best  specimen  we  saw  of 
a  town  of  settled  Kirghese. 

tion  of  a  betrothed  maiden,  the  offender  and  her  parents  are  bound 
to  provide  a  bride  for  the  bridegroom  elect,  and  to  pay  him  a  kalim 
besides.  Again,  an  offence  against  a  married  woman  involves  the 
pa3rment  of  a  fine  to  the  husband,  and  in  Akmolinsk  is  accompanied  by 
the  strange  custom  of  the  offended,  in  proof  of  the  veracity  of  his 
accusation,  cutting  off  the  tails  of  the  offender's  horses.  A  man 
who  has  enticed  the  wife  of  another  is  free  to  take  her  for  his  own  on 
pajnment  of  a  kalim  to  the  offended  husband,  or  on  giving  him  an 
unmarried  woman  for  whom  the  kalim  has  been  paid.  Incest  is  punished 
by  relatives  of  the  offending  parties  as  they  may  choose ;  and  illegiti- 
mate children  have  to  be  supported  by  the  father.

WE  left  Vierny  at  lo  o clock  on  September  8th 
to  continue  our  journey  westwards,  our  good 
friend  M.  von  Ghern  trotting  by  our  side  to  give  us 
a  Russian  farewell.  It  was  beautiful  weather  for 
travelling,  and  not  too  hot  by  day,  but  it  became  chilly 
immediately  after  sunset,  and  by  the  small  hours  of  the 
morning  grew  cold  enough  to  make  one  thankful  in 
the  tarantass  for  an  Ulster  and  shawl.  For  some 
distance  out  of  the  town  the  land  was  cultivated  on 
either  side  of  the  road,  and  beside  some  of  the  settlers' 
dwellings  were  stacks  that  might  have  been  mistaken 
for  peat,  but  were  in  reality  kiziak,  or  dried  dung,  that 
is  still  used  as  fuel  by  the  natives,  even  in  wooded 
localities.  On  our  left  were  the  mountains,  partially 
covered  with  forests,  whither  many  of  the  inhabitants 


FROM  VIERNY  TO  AULIE-ATA,

go  to  live  in  chilets  in  summer,  and  the  governor  of 
the  province  among  them.  At  our  first  station, 
Kiskilenskaia,*  we  were  offered  pretty  ornaments  of 
agalmatholite,  or  "  figure  stone,"  called  by  the  natives 
kalyptash,  or  stone  for  bullet-moulds  (from  kalyp,  form, 
and  task,  a  stone).  The  stone  is  found  within  a  few  versts 
of  Kiskilenskaia,  as  also  between  Kopal  and  Vierny, 
likewise  in  Kashgar,  and  is  so  soft  that  it  can  almost  be 
cut  with  a  knife,  or  scratched  with  the  thumb-nail.  It 
is  sold  in  Vierny  fashioned  into  paper-weights  polished 
with  wax,  and  pen-trays,  two  of  which  M.  von  Ghern 
had  given  me  as  geological  specimens.  Our  second 
station  was  Uzun-Agach  (Long  Tree),  the  scene  of  the 
battle  of  1864,  to  which  I  have  alluded,  between  the 
Russians  and  the  Khokandians.  The  killed  were  buried 
on  the  top  of  the  hill  near  the  picket,  the  spot  being 
marked  by  the  erection  of  a  cross,  covered  with  tin, 
on  a  white  stone  pedestal,  since  which  time  there  has 
sprung  up,  close  by,  the  hamlet  Kasansk-Borodinsky. 
Thus  far  we  had  travelled  only  fairly  well,  for  though 
the  broken  wheel  of  our  luggage-cart  had  been  mended 
at  Vierny,  the  vehicle  twice  broke  down  before  even-

ing,  by  which  time  we  reached  Sam-Su,  near  the  ruins 
of  Fort  Kastek.  Here  a  message  from  the  authorities 
at  Viemy  had  preceded  me  that  horses  should  be  in 
readiness,  and  the  amiable  old  post-master,  thinking 
that  some  one  of  importance  must  be  coming,  had  put 
out  bread  and  salt  for  a  welcome,  and  he  inquired 
privately  of  Mr.  Interpreter  by  what  titles  he  should 
address  me. 

Had  we  intended  to  visit  Lake  Issik-Kul,  this  would 
have  been  the  point  from  which  to  turn  our  faces  south- 
wards over  the  Kastek  Pass,  3,300  feet  high,  to  the 


head  waters  of  the  Chu,  along  the  bed  of  which  the 
post-road  runs  through  the  Buam  defile,  called  by  the 
natives  the  Happy   Pass,  to  the  station   Kutemaldi.*  ' 

*  From  Kutemaldi  there  goes  off  a.  sumpter  post-road,  directly  south, 
along  which  there  are  pickets  as  far  as  Fort  Narin.  Beyond  this  is  a 
bridle-road  to  Kashgar,  200  miles  in  all  as  the  crow  flies,  but  not  less 
than  260  miles  distant  by  this  route.  Kutemaldi  lies  at  a  height  of 
5,300  feet  above  the  sea  level,  and  the  path  proceeds  along  the  bed 
of  the  Kochkur  to  the  Dolan  Pass  (10,100  feet),  then  descends  into  the 
Narin  valley  to  the  river  and  fort  (7,100  feet)  of  that  name,  which  is 
practically  the  Russian  outpost.  Beyond  it  a  bridle-path  ascends 
along  the  Kara-Kain  stream  to  the  Kash-Rabat  Pass  (12,930  feet). 


FROM   VIERNY  TO  AULIE-ATA.  355 

The  beauty  of  this  defile  is  greatly  extolled  by 
travellers.  The  road  then  skirts  the  northern  shore 
of  the  Issik-Kul,  between  its  extreme  western  and 
eastern  points,  and  turns  off  at  a  right  angle  to 
Karakol,  at  a  height  of  5,430  feet,  and  distant  from 
Kastek  about  170  miles,  or  from  Pishpek,  the  point  of 
departure  that  would  be  taken  from  the  west,  14  stations 
and  250  miles.* 


skirts  the  eastern  shore  of  Lake  Chadir-Kul,  11,080  feet  high,  then 
crosses  the  Turgart  Pass  at  12,800  feet  into  Chinese  territory.  After 
this,  for  about  90  miles,  the  traveller  gradually  descends  some  8,000  feet 
to  Kashgar,  passing  on  the  way  four  or  five  stations. 

*  Karakol  may  be  approached  also  by  another  carriage-road  proceed- 
ing eastwards  from  Viemy  at  the  foot  of  the  Trans-Ili  Ala-Tau  as  far  as 
the  River  Chilik,  and  then  ascending  the  mountains  to  Tabdi-Bulak> 
which  is  about  30  mites  east  of  Karakol,  and  a  point  of  road  near  to  the 
giant  Tengri-Khan,  towering  aloft  to  the  height  of  21,000  feet.  General 
Walker's  map  indicates  a  carriage-road  proceeding  from  Tabdi-Bulak 
for  about  40  miles  to  the  Chinese  frontier  at  Muzart,  40  miles  north  of 
the  famous  pass{iz,ooo  feet)  of  that  name  ;  but  I  can  find  no  authority. 


356  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

From  Kastek  or  Sam-Su,  where  we  had  arrived  at 
even,  the  old  post-road  would  have  led  us  up  into 
the  mountains  to  Tokmak,*  and  then  on  to  Pishpek,  a 
route  that  M.  von  Ghern  had  been  desirous  that  I 
should  take,  with  a  view  to  seeing  the  Kara-Kirghese 
in  their  native  haunts.  But  the  road  was  said  to  be 
almost  too  bad  for  a  carriage,  and  I  had  determined 
accordingly  to  keep  to  the  lower  road,  which  had  been 
made  in  1870  to  avoid  the  steep  and  dangerous 
gradients  of  the  old  route.  Accordingly  we  drove 
along  the  Kopa  valley,  passing  three  stations  during 
the  night,  and  arriving  in  time  for  breakfast  at  Suigati, 
where  the  diversion  awaited  us,  described  in  the  last 
chapter,  of  a  visit  to  the  Kirghese  election. 

Nogai  Bi,  whom  we  saw  elected  chief  of.  the  volost, 
was  reckoned  a  fairly  rich  man  ;  but  not  like  Nabal, 
who  had  3,000  sheep  and  1,000  goats  (i  Sam.  xxv.  2), 
or  Job,  with  14,000  sheep,  6,000  camels,  2,000  oxen, 
and  1,000  she  asses  (Job  xlii.  12);  though  these 
numbers  need  surprise  no  one  after  hearing  of  the 
millions  of  cattle  on  the  Kirghese  Steppe.  This 
modern  patriarch  of  our  acquaintance  owned  to  pos- 
sessing merely  150  horses,  500  sheep,  30  cows,  20 
camels,  2  tents,  and — 4  wives !  His  rich  tent,  erected 
for  the  Russian  officer,  also  bespoke  its  owner's 
opulence,  as  did  his  massive  silver  girdle,  four  or  five 

either  in  my  Russian  post -book  or  maps,  for  anything  more  than  a 
bridle-path. 

♦  Dr.  Schuyler  points  out  that  about  15  miles  from  the  present  Tokmak, 
a  place  of  2,000  inhabitants,  there  are  the  ruins  of  an  old  town  of  the 
same  name  that  was  formerly  the  capital  of  a  principality,  and  gave  to 
the  Mongols  the  name  for  all  the  country  to  the  west — the  realm  of 
Kipchak,  and  accordingly  that  when  we  read,  as  in  the  "  History  of  East 
Mongolia,"  by  Sanang  Setzen  (i  196-1452),  of  wars  between  the  Mongol 
Khan  and  the  Sultan  of  Tokmak,  the  latter  means  the  Shah  of  Kharezm 
or  Khiva.

of  which  he  put  at  a  prohibitive  figure,  though  I 
secured  one  of  his  Kii^hese  rings  that  is  now  in  the 
British  Museum.* 

I  took  occasion  at  Suigati  to  ask  the  official  inter- 
preters, who  seemed  intelligent  fellows,  what  they 
thought  of  the  version  I  had  with  me  of  the  New 
Testament.  They  replied  that  it  was  not  true  Kirghese, 
but  '*a  mixture  of  Turkish  and  Arabic,  which,*'  said 
they,  '*  makes  Tatar."  t

better  to  realize  the  indignity  put  upon  the  Jews  in  Bokhara  by  the 
Emir,  who  allows  no  Israelite,  however  rich,  to  gird  himself  with  other 
than  a  piece  of  string.  Nogai  Bi  had  also  four  servants,  but  whether 
formerly  slaves  I  know  not.  The  Kirghese  made  slaves  of  all  heretics 
they  could,  and  even  of  Shiite  Mussulmans,  though  it  is  forbidden  to 
Muhammadans  to  make  slaves  of  their  co-religionists,  as  it  was  to  the 
Israelites  to  treat  as  bondmen  their  fellow-countrymen  (Lev.  xxv.  42). 
They  evaded  the  precepts  of  the  Koran  by  regarding  the  Shiites  as 
heretics.  This  is  not  allowed  under  Russian  rule ;  but  reference  to  the 
custom  helps  to  illustrate  another  feature  in  Jewish  patriarchal  life, 
where  we  read  of  Abraham's  "servants  bom  in  his  own  house,"  and 
others  ** bought  with  money  of  any  stranger."  The  same  practice 
obtained  in  Mosaic  times,  with  bondmen  bought  of  the  heathen  round 
about.  Abram's  wealth  is  seen  in  his  318  trained  servants,  with  whom 
he  attacked  the  4  kings,  and  delivered  men,  women,  and  goods,  that 
had  apparently  been  seized  very  much  in  the  fashion  of  a  Kirghese 
baranta  or  Turkoman  raid  (Gen.  xiv.  14,  xvii.  12  ;  Lev.  xxv.  44). 

t  Dr.  Schuyler  says  that  the  Kirghese  language  differs  from  Tatar  in 
the  interchange  of  certain  letters,/ for  y^  b  for^,  zh  ior  j\  sk  for  tch^ 
t  for  d,  p  for/*,  d  for  /,  etc. ;  that  few  Persian  or  Arabic  words  are  used  ; 
and  that  there  are  many  peculiar  to  the  Kirghese  dialect.  I  heard 
of  no  Kazak  literature  in  the  plains,  but  Captain  Valikhanof  says  the 
Dikokamenni  possess  a  remarkable  epic  called  the  ''Manas" — ^an 
encyclopaedic  collection  of  Kirghese  mythological  tales  and  traditions, 
grouped  round  one  person — the  giant  Manas,  and  also  an  epos  called 
the  Samyateiy  the  former  of  which  he  designates  the  Iliad  of  the 
Steppe,  and  the  latter  the  Burnt  Odyssey.     The  language  of  the  Diko-

the  Koran,  but  there  are  few  who  study.  As  a  rule, 
only  the  mullahs  and  official  persons  know  how  to  read 
and  write.  At  the  same  time  it  should  be  observed 
that,  as  far  as  can  be  judged  from  the  number  of  those 
who  have  received  a  certain  education,  the  capabilities 
of  the  Kirghese  are  good,  and  sciences  are  said  to  be 
quite  within  their  reach.  The  girls  have  rarely  any 
mental  education,  but  are  taught  to  sew,  spin,  and 
weave,  to  make  clothes,  curtains,  and  felts,  to  embroider 
in  silk,  gold,  etc.,  and  to  cook.f 

On  leaving  Suigati,  after  a  pleasant  stay  with 
M.  Troitzky,  we  once  more  proceeded  westwards, 
and  approached  the  River  Chu.  This  stream,  rising  in 
the  Thian  Shan,  and  consisting  of  the  Eastern  Karakol 
and  the  Suiok,  is  called  at  their  confluence  the  Kochkur, 
a  mountain  torrent  that  flows  in  an  easterly  direction 
to  within  about  3  miles  of  the  western  shore  of  Lake 

kamenni  Kirghese,  he  says,  is  Turkish,  resembling  more  closely  than 
any  other  that  spoken  in  Little  Bokhara  or  Kashgaria.  In  it  there 
are  scarcely  any  Arabic  or  Persian  words,  it  being  composed  prin- 
cipally of  Mongolian  and  primitive  Turki. 

*  The  instructions  of  the  youths  under  native  teachers  is  undertaken 
by  mullahs,  who  live  for  this  purpose  during  the  winter  among  the  more 
thickly-peopled  localities,  where  they  gather  the  boys  for  a  certain 
number  of  hours  per  day.  Their  instruction  consists  of  committing  to 
memory,  of  singing  in  chorus,  and  in  writing  out  Tatar  phrases  from  dicta- 
tion. There  is  no  method  in  the  instruction,  and  it  often  happens  that  the 
pupils  of  one  mullah  can  with  difficulty  make  out  the  written  instruction 
of  another,  the  art  of  writing  being  taught  according  to  different  rules. 

t  I  notice,  from  the  West  Siberian  Kalendar  for  1881,  that  in  1865 
a  Kirghese  school  was  ordered  to  be  opened  in  Omsk  for  the  training  of 
copyists  for  the  Kirghese  volosts,  and  that,  subsequently,  a  number  of 
Kirghese  institutions  called  internats,  or  boarding-schools,  have  been 
opened  for  boys,  and  in  some  cases  for  girls,  in  Pavlodar,  Zaisan  Post, 
Petropavlovsk,  Kokchetof,  Akmolinsk,  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  Atbasar, 
Omsk,  and  Karkaraly.  The  schools  and  intemats  are  supported  from 
the  rates  paid  by  the  Kirghese,  amounting  in  1881,  in  the  province  of 
Semipolatinsk,  on  an  average,  to  2s.  qd.  for  each  tent,  in  addition  to 
the  6j.  for  Crown  taxes.  For  the  Kirghese  school  in  Omsk  was  expended 
^^404;  for  that  in  Ust-Kamenogorsk  j^240 ;  and  for  the  intemats  ;f  2, 651.

Issik-Kul,  where  it  gives  off  the  small  stream  of  the 
Kutemaldi,  through  which  a  portion  of  its  water  finds 
its  way  into  the  lake.* 

Certain  parts  of  the  river  banks  are  frequented  by 
the  Kirghese  only  in  winter,  because  the  meadows 
and  grazing  grounds  are  few.  As  we  approached 
Constantinovsk,  where  the  inhabitants  devote  some 
amount  of  time  at  least  to  agriculture,  we  passed  by 
the  largest  aul  we  had  seen.  The  number  of  children 
running  about  attracted  our  attention,  many  of  them 
nude,  and  evidently  brought  up  under  circumstances 
as  rough  as  those  in  which  they  began  life ;  for  the 
mother,  having  been  at  work  to  the  last,  and  having 
little  rest  allowed  her  after  childbirth,  simply  wraps 
her  new-born  infant  in  a  cloth  in  summer,  or  in  a 
sheepskin  in  winter,  and  there  ends  the  business. 
It  is  only  in  cases  of  difficult  birth  that  relations  give 
assistance  as  accoucheurs,  magicians,  and  sorceresses. 
Under  the  most  favourable  circumstances  these  make 
grimaces  and  whisper,  but  commonly  have  recourse  to 

♦  From  this  point  the  river  takes  a  sharp  turn  to  the  west,  and  flows 
through  the  picturesque  Buam  defile,  the  river  being  now  fordable, 
while  before  it  was  not.  Here  the  Chu  is  bridged  in  two  places,  and, 
the  defile  being  passed,  the  valley  opens  out  to  a  width,  at  Tokmak,  of 
ij  miles,  affording  the  nomads  excellent  pasture.  Below  this  point  the 
river  distributes  its  waters  over  numberless  branches,  forming  a  whole 
archipelago  of  islands,  with  an  average  depth  of  only  2  feet.  From 
Fort  Tokmak  the  Chu  is  practicable  for  raft  floating,  and  10  miles 
lower,  even  for  navigation,  for  200  miles,  until  the  river  begins  to  dis- 
tribute itself  in  channels  overgrown  with  reeds.  In  this  200  miles  the 
channel  is  not  less  than  4  feet  deep,  whilst  its  maximum  may  reach 
14  feet.  The  width  of  the  river  nowhere  exceeds  140  yards,  and  in  its 
lower  course  does  not  measure  half  this  width.  Its  attenuated  waters, 
after  an  entire  course  of  633  miles,  finally  run  into  the  Steppe  lake, 
Sauman-Kul,  thus  falling  short  of  the  Syr-daria  by  67  miles.  The 
Chu  is  rich  in  fish,  and  contains  Bream,  Suig,  Pike,  Perch,  Roach, 
Chebak  (a  sort  of  Bream),  and  Crucian  Carp ;  also  a  few  Silurus  and 
Sazan,  or  Perch- Pike. 


36o  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

more  pernicious  measures.  The  one  right  the  mother 
possesses  is  to  name  the  new-born  child,*  which  she 
exercises  in  an  original  manner,  sometimes  calling  her 
infant  by  the  first  object  that  meets  her  eye  after 
delivery,  whence  such  curious  names  as  It-Ayak,  or 
**  dog's  foot." 

We  crossed  the  Chu  by  a  wooden  bridge,  and,  after 
driving  1 5  miles,  arrived  at  6  o'clock  at  Pishpek,  where 
the  new  road,  by  which  we  had  come,  joined  the  old 
one  from  Tokmak.  Pishpek  is  a  village  with  wide 
streets  and  a  school,  wherein  the  master  showed  us  a 
small  local  collection  of  butterflies  and  beetles,  but  the 
principal  object  of  attraction  for  us  was  a  large  botanical 
garden,  to  the  superintendent  of  which,  M.  Fetissof, 
we  had  an  introduction.  To  his  house  the  obliging 
starosta  took  us,  but,  unfortunately,  he  was  not  at 
home,  whereupon  the  schoolmaster  accompanied  us  to 
the  garden. 

The  trees  were  only  young,  and  the  weeds  were 
high,  but  it  was  evident  that  M.  Fetissof  had  before 
him  a  vast  undertaking,  and  that  he  had  brought 
together  a  considerable  collection  of  trees,  shrubs,  and 
plants   indigenous   to    the   region,    and   that   he   was 

*  With  this  might  be  compared  the  circumstances  of  birth  and  giving 
of  names  in  the  cases  of  Rebekah,  the  mother  of  Esau  and  Jacob ;  of 
Rachel,  who,  in  departing,  called  Benjamin  '*  son  of  my  sorrow  "  ;  and 
of  Pharez,  who  was  bom  before  his  twin  brother,  and,  in  consequence, 
called  a  "breach  "  (Gen.  xxv.  25,  26,  xxxv.  16,  18,  xxxviii.  28,  29).  M. 
Ujfalvy  describes  the  Kirghese  as  fond  mothers,  who  sometimes  suckle 
their  children  up  to  four  years  of  age.  They  have  a  custom,  he  says, 
of  pulling,  with  a  view  to  extending,  their  children's  ears,  from  earliest 
infancy,  that  they  may  hear  the  better.  As  the  children  grow  up, 
they  get  scanty  attention  from  either  father  or  mother.  Up  to  the 
age  of  12  or  13  years  they  go  about  in  summer,  as  we  saw,  almost 
naked,  or  in  tatters ;  and  in  winter,  because  of  the  cold,  they  crowd 
among  the  sheep  under  cover,  and  only  their  half-shaven  heads  peep 
out  from  amongst  the  animals  as  they  gaze  with  surprised  and  rapid 
eyes  on  any  visitor  who  may  approach.

making  experiments  with  a  view  of  introducing  others. 
As  it  was  uncertain  when  M.  Fetissof  would  return, 
I  determined  not  to  stay  at  Pishpek,  but  push  on 
through  the  night,  now  warmer  than  heretofore. 
Morning  found  us  still  skirting  the  mountain  range  we 
had  had  on  our  left  all  the  way  from  Vierny.  It  was 
a  continuation  of  the  Trans- Hi  Ala-Tau,  that,  west  of 
the  Buam  Pass,  is  called  the  Alexandrof  range.  Judged 
by  its  Alpine  vegetation,  it  is  said  to  be  from  9,000  to 
1 0,000  feet  high.* 

In  the  course  of  the  night  we  passed  Sukuluk,  a 
settlement  with  a  score  or  more  of  houses,  and  arrived 
at  the  fortified  place  Ak-Su,  near  which  is  a  village 
called  Belovodsk,  with  wide  streets  lined  by  willows, 
with  a  church,  a  school,  and  nearly  a  hundred  houses, 
occupied  for  the  most  part  by  Russian  colonists  from 
the  government  of  Voronej  and  from  Little  Russia, 
Dawn  found  us  two  stations  further,  at  Chaldavar, 
where  we  bought  two  **  Astrakhan  "  melons,  that  were 
considered  choice,  and  by  breakfast  time  we  had 
reached  Merke.  It  is  not  many  years  since  the  line 
of  pickets  between  Tokmak  and  Aulie-Ata,  with  the 

*  Perpetual  snow  appears  on  it  opposite  the  town  of  Tokmak,  and  its 
highest  peaks  rise  to  15,000  feet.  The  line  of  perpetual  snow,  from 
13,000  to  14,000  feet  high,  stretches  as  far  as  the  sources  of  the  Kara- 
Balta.  From  hence  the  range  gradually  falls  towards  the  west  as  far 
as  Merke,  near  which  its  height  does  not  exceed  9,200  feet.  Further 
westward,  the  range  rapidly  rises  again  above  the  snow-line,  and  sinks 
towards  Aulie-Ata,  near  which  it  has  not  an  absolute  height  of  more 
than  2,600  feet,  or  of  150  feet  above  the  level  of  the  River  Talas.  Down 
the  northern  slope  of  the  Alexandrof  range  flow  numerous  rivers, 
whence  the  ancients  called  this  district  Ming-Bulak,  or  the  *•  land  of 
a  thousand  springs,*'  and  the  same  slope  is  covered  with  forest  up  to 
a  height  of  from  5,000  to  8,000  feet,  but  the  southern  slope  is  quite  bare 
of  wood.  The  low  passes  over  the  range  are  covered  with  excellent 
pastures.  Tall  grasses,  mountain  poppies,  and  peonies  grow  at  a 
height  of  7,500  feet,  and  the  common  juniper  and  black  currant  bushes 
are  occasionally  met  with.

fortress  of  Merke,  used  to  form  the  left  flank  of  the 
province  of  Turkistan.  Now  all  wears  an  aspect  of 
peace.  Colonies  have  been  settled  about  some  of  the 
pickets,  newly-planted  woods  constantly  appear,  the 
fortress  is  abolished,  the  surrounding  country  is  dotted 
over  with  the  huts  of  Kirghese  labourers,  and  Merke 
is  enlivened  by  the  presence  of  post-office  and  tele- 
graph clerks. 

I  took  advantage  of  the  presence  of  these  latter  indi- 
viduals to  send  a  telegram  to  General  Kolpakovsky, 
for  not  until  now  had  we  reached  the  frontier  of  his 
General  Government  of  the  Steppe,  and  were  about  to 
pass  out  of  Semirechia  into  Turkistan.  I  could  not 
but  feel  how  much  I  owed  to  his  Excellency's  care  and 
attention.  All  had  gone  well,  and  I  telegraphed  to 
thank  him,  and  to  say  how  much  I  had  enjoyed  my 
stay.* 

We  were  delayed  for  an  hour  or  two  at  Merke  for 
the  repair  of  the  box  I  had  fastened  in  the  rear  of 
the  tarantass,  and  wherein  I  had  stowed  my  saddle. 
This  post-house  was  a  vast  improvement  upon  any  of 

♦  I  cannot  pass  from  the  mention  of  General  Kolpakovsky  without 
saying  how  much  I  heard  of  his  worth,  and  what  marks  of  careful 
administration  he  has  left  in  Semirechia,  over  which  he  was  Governor. 
His  Excellency  was  born,  Dr.  Schuyler  says,  in  1819.  He  was  the  son 
of  a  subaltern  officer  in  the  province  of  Kherson,  and  at  16  years  of  age 
entered  the  service  as  a  private  soldier.  In  10  months  he  was  made 
a  non-commissioned  officer,  and  so  remained  until  1841,  when  he  re- 
ceived a  commission.  He  served  for  a  long  time  in  the  Caucasus,  and 
afterwards  in  Transylvania  during  the  Hungarian  war,  until,  in  1852, 
he  was  transferred  to  Western  Siberia,  where  he  has  spent  the  remainder 
of  his  life.  At  first  he  was  stationed  at  the  inhospitable  town  of  Berezof, 
but  in  1858  was  transferred  to  the  district  of  the  Ala-Tau.  He  knows 
Semirechia  well,  having  passed  whole  days  in  the  saddle  riding  over  it, 
so  that  the  Kirghese,  whose  language  he  knows,  have  given  him  the 
name  of  "  the  iron  seat."  I  heard  that  the  Kuldja  natives  placed  great 
<:onfidence  in  him,  which  will,  no  doubt,  be  shared  now  by  the  more 
numerous  inhabitants  of  the  general  government  of  the  Steppe. 


FROM  VIERNY  TO  AULIE-ATA.  363 

those  we  had  recently  seen,  and  was  kept  by  a  Pole, 
who  bought  a  New  Testament.  From  the  next  station, 
Munkinsk,  we  gave  a  lift  to  the  starosta,  who  seized 
the  opportunity  of  our  coming  to  start  on  a  journey, 
and  begged  for  a  place  on  the  luggage  vehicle,  which 
vehicle,  two  stations  further  on,  threatened  to  delay  us 
through  the  tire  of  the  fore-wheel  coming  almost  off. 
Fortunately  we  found  a  wayside  smith,  who  quickly 
put  it  to  rights  for  4?.,  pleading  by  way  of  apology  for 
his  charges  that  coal  was  dear,  as  indeed  it  well  might 
be,  we  thought,  in  such  an  outlandish  place. 

At  the  next  station,  Moldabavsk,  we  had  drunk  tea, 
and  were  preparing  to  start,  when  one  of  the  horses 
kicked  a  Tatar  yemstchik  and  fractured  his  leg  in  the 
upper  third.  This  was  clearly  a  case  for  Mr.  Sevier*s 
attention  ;  so  he  first  ordered  the  man  to  be  put  to  bed, 
when  it  turned  out  that  his  sleeping-place  was  in  a 
sledge,  under  an  open  shed.  Here,  therefore,  we 
bandaged  up  the  limb  in  a  box  splint,  extemporized 
splints  of  split  boards,  bandaging  with  towels,  and 
tied  round  the  limb  with  string.  The  patient  was  then 
laid  in  the  sledge  with  his  leg  somewhat  elevated,  and 
with  pendent  stones  for  weights  to  straighten  the 
limb.  He  was  told  what  to  do  for  a  month,  given 
some  money,  and  the  keeper  of  the  inn  enjoined  to 
take  care  of  him,  after  which  his  good  Samaritan  left 
him,  roughly  doctored,  no  doubt,  but  much  better  than 
would  have  been  his  lot  had  no  surgeon  been  there. 
We  then  passed  three  stations  during  the  night,  and 
arrived  in  the  morning  at  Aulie-Ata. 

Aulie-Ata  stands  on  classic  ground,  as  will  be  seen 
hereafter,  in  connection  with  the  ancient  history  of 
Central  Asia.  To-day  it  is  a  town  of  4,500  inhabitants, 
living  in  741  houses,  of  which  only  50  are  occupied  by 


364  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Russians,  the  remainder  by  natives,  of  whom  Kirghese 
form  the  largest  proportion.  I  had,  in  fact,  at  Vierny 
been  told  that  I  could  purchase  the  best  articles  of 
Kirghese  manufacture  in  Aulie-Ata.  Soon  after  our 
arrival,  therefore,  we  went  to  the  offices  of  the  uyezdi- 
iiachalnik,  or  chief  of  the  district,  where  we  again 
found  that  a  telegram  had  preceded  us  to  facilitate  our 
procuring  horses. 

The  assistant  chief  and  a  military  officer  kindly 
volunteered  to  accompany  me  to  the  market  and 
bazaar.  The  advantage  of  this  we  soon  found  ;  for 
not  only  were  these  officials  accompanied  by  inter- 
preters, but  by  djiguitts  also,  mounted  forerunners,, 
who  preceded  us  in  the  narrow  crowded  bazaar,  and 
speedily  cleared  the  way.  Indeed,  it  was  ridiculous 
to  see  how  unceremoniously  the  djiguitts  unhitched 
standing  horses,  and  set  them  adrift. 

I  found  exposed  here  several  articles  of  Kii^hese 
make  and  use,  among  which  were  native  hats,  boots, 
and  bridles,  some  rude  jewellery  for  ear-rings,  orna- 
mental tassels  for  suspending  in  the  tent,  and  a  piece 
of  female  headgear  called  a  tara,  to  hang  in  a  double 
row  across  the  breast  of  an  under-garment,  also  a 
tckinikap,  or  wooden  receptacle,  in  which  to  suspend 
a  basin  when  travelling.  I  bought  specimens  of  all 
these.  I  also  saw  exhibited  a  drink  called  airariy 
made  of  whey  sweetened  with  honey  and  cooled  with 
ice  ;  likewise  tursuks,  or  goat-skins,  for  holding  liquids. 

The  manners  of  the  people  were  as  novel  to  me  as 
their  wares.  Here  was  a  man  striving  to  allay  the 
dust,  not  with  a  water-cart,  but  by  carrying  a  skin  of 
water,  and  sputtering  it  out  of  the  aperture.  Behind 
the  charcoal  fire  of  a  Kirghese  smith  sat  an  unfortunate 
individual,    whose    calling    in    life  was   to  blow  the

bellows,  consisting  of  two  leather  bags  he  had  to  press 
alternately  for  12  hours  a  day,  and  for  which  he  was 
paid  2s.  a  week.  At  many  of  the  stalls  they  exhibited 
in  cages,  for  8^.  each,  quails  or  other  small  birds  caught 
by  hawks.  They  teach  them  to  sing  and  to  fight.  A 
specimen  of  the  latter  exhibition  they  wished  to  show 
me,  but  I  declined.  A  little  further  I  noticed  another 
curiosity  in  the  case  of  a  hawk,  through  whose  eyelids 
they  had  passed  and  tied  a  piece  of  thread  in  such  a 
way  as  to  draw  the  lids  nearer  together  for  a  day  or 
two,  the  object,  I  was  informed,  being  to  converge  the 
axis  of  vision,  so  as  to  improve  the  bird  for  hawking 
purposes.  The  market  prices  did  not  strike  one  as 
exorbitant.  For  soap  was  asked  2  J^.,  and  potatoes  \d. 
per  lb.  Large  radishes  cost  \d.  each.  Salt,  found 
in  the  neighbourhood,  cost  i^.  3^.  per  cwt,  and  barley 
i^.  6d.  per  cwt.  Timber,  however,  was  expensive,  a 
crooked  log,  10  feet  long  by  6  inches  in  diameter, 
being  valued  at  4^.,  and  a  roughly-made  wooden  bed- 
stead at  as  much  as  24^. 

Everything  had  to  be  purchased  of  course  by  hag- 
gling, fixed  prices  being  unknown,  and  I  observed  in 
the  course  of  my  purchases  an  illustration  of  a  custom 
as  old  as  the  time  of  Job  (xvii.  3),  that  of  ''  striking 
hands "  in  connection  with  suretyship  or  agreement. 
A  man  had  asked  me  too  much  for  an  article,  and  the 
Russian  officer,  who  accompanied  me,  offered  a  second 
price,  and  then,  after  the  Kirghese  custom,  held  out 
his  hand,  whereupon  the  salesman,  hesitating  a 
moment,  raised  his  hand,  and,  in  token  that  he  agreed 
to  the  bargain,  brought  it  down  with  a  slap  on  the 
officer  s  palm.  We  chanced  to  pass  a  barber  s  shop, 
where  a  man,  after  having  water  poured  on  his  head, 
was  shaved  without  soap  with  a  Chinese  razor,  and 


366  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

then  put  through  a  series  of  squeezings   like   those 
experienced  in  a  Turkish  bath,  this  Eastern  barber,  as 
usual,  ending  by  kneading  his  body,  pulling  his  joints, 
slapping  his  back,  and  cracking  his  knuckles.     Whilst 
witnessing  this  operation  my  eyes  fell  upon  a  pair  of 
pincers,  the  length  of  curling-tongs,  and  nearly  power- 
ful enough  to  extract  a  tenpenny  naiL     I  made  bold 
to  ask  what   they  were  for,  and  was  told  they   were 
for  extracting  teeth  !  which  so  tickled  my  fancy,  that  I 
bought  them  forthwith  as  a  curiosity. 

The  **  lion,"  however,  of  Aulie-Ata  is  the  tomb  of 
the  local  patron  saint,  that  gives  its  name  to  the  town. 
The  Kirghese  make  much  of  the  resting-places  of  the 
dead.* 

If  in  such  a  spot  a  tree  or  bush  grows  (a  rare  thing 
in  the  steppe),  the  sanctity  of  the  tomb  is  confirmed,^ 
and  prayers  offered  there  are  considered  specially 
efficacious,  and  oaths  administered  to  be  peculiarly 
binding.  Aulie-Ata  (holy  father)  is  said  to  have  been 
a  certain  Kara  khan,  and  a  descendant  of  the  Sheikh 
Ahmed  Yesavi.  We  went  out  to  the  cemetery,  and 
found  there  two  principal  tombs.  That  of  the  saint, 
said  to  have  been  buried  800  years  ago,  is  built  of 

•  The  Buruts,  according  to  Veniukoff,  reverence  even  the  remaining* 
monuments  of  an  ancient  race  formerly  inhabiting  their  country,, 
notably  a  high  brick  column  near  Tokmak,  in  which,  according  to  a 
popular  tradition,  a  certain  khan  built  up  his  daughter  after  her  death  ! 
The  old  relics  of  their  own  people  are  yet  more  highly  reverenced,  the 
tombs  of  famous  ancestors  being  held  sacred  as  places  of  prayer,  from 
whence  to  remove  the  remains  or  any  appurtenance  belonging  to  the 
dead  is  considered  a  crime.  To  become  a  Kirghese  saint  (aulia)  was 
not  formerly  a  difficult  matter.  A  man  had  only  to  be  a  bold  plunderer, 
and  to  leave  behind  him  good  possessions,  and  then  his  descendants 
would  place  his  body  in  a  large  tomb.  Such  tombs  were  at  first  visited 
by  relations  only,  but  others  followed,  and  made  the  place  sacred  by 
their  prayers  and  their  gifts.  These  gifts  are  simple  enough,  and 
generally  consist  of  variegated  rags  and  bones,  especially  horns  and 
skulls. 


FROM  VIERNY  TO  AULIE-ATA,  367 

dried  ornamental  bricks,  is  of  no  architectural  beauty, 
and  is  fast  falling  to  ruin.  The  doors  leading  to  the 
tomb  are  carved,  and  there  are  remains  on  the  walls  of 
ornamented  plaster.  Near  at  hand  was  erected  a  pole 
with  a  banner,  called  a  bairak,  usually  placed  about 
the  tombs  of  saints,  and  also  near  were  rams*  skulls 
and  horns,  the  remains,  perhaps,  of  offerings.  When 
thus  placed  on  a  tomb,  horns  indicate  that  those  buried 
were  saints  or  heroes,  or  at  any  rate  powerful  or 
eminent  persons.  Alexander  the  Great,  who  lives  in 
the  traditions  of  the  people  further  south,  is  called 
**  the  double-horned  one,"  as  in  other  parts  of  the 
East,  I  am  told,  because  on  his  coins  are  the  horns 
of  Jupiter  Ammon.  This  also  illustrates  the  frequent 
mention  in  Scripture  of  the  horn  as  a  symbol  of  power. 
We  were  near  coming  in  for  a  feast  as  we  approached 
the  next  tomb,  that  of  Aulie-Ata's  son,  for  there  were 
gathered  about  it  a  small  crowd  of  women  and  chil- 
dren, who  had  come  there  to  pray  and  eat  and  play. 
As  it  was  to  be  my  first  and  probably  my  only  visit,  I 
wanted  of  course  to  see  the  place,  and  for  that  purpose 
pushed  my  way  into  the  enclosure,  among  the  women 
and  children,  but  committed  thereby,  I  fear,  a  breach 
of  Oriental  etiquette,  for  the  women  crowded  together, 
and  hid  their  faces,  leaving,  however,  an  eye  uncovered, 
that  they  might  have  a  good  look  at  the  strangers,  but 
without  bestowing  a  reciprocal  favour  upon  us.  We 
then  learned  that  several  club  together  and  buy  a 
sheep,  and  bring  it  there,  usually  on  Thursday,  to 
eat,  and  hold  a  feast.* 

•  This  reminds  one  of  those  Jewish  feasts  in  which  religious  cere- 
monies were  to  be  accompanied  with  eating  and  rejoicing  before  the 
Lord  (Deut.  xii.  18),  and  illustrates  the  doings  of  the  Israelites  before 
the  golden  calf,  when  they  offered  burnt-offerings,  and  brought  peace- 
offerings,  and  the  people  sat  down  to  eat  and  drink,  and  rose  up  to 


368  liUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

We  did  not  remain  long  in  Aulie-Ata,  whence  we 
set  out  for  Tashkend  ;  but  we  were  now  in  the  general 
government  of  Turkistan,  which  I  must  accordingly 
proceed  to  describe. 

play  (Exod.  xxxii.  6).  There  is  also  the  case  of  Aaron,  and  all  the 
elders  of  Israel,  eating  bread  with  Moses*  father-in-law  ''before  God" 
(Exod.  xviii.  12).  It  is  interesting  to  notice  that  a  remnant  of  this 
practice  still  lingers  in  at  least  one  branch  (and  that  one  the  most 
corrupt,  perhaps,  that  I  have  seen)  of  the  Christian  Church — namely, 
the  Armenian.  The  charge  is  sometimes  brought  that  they  continue 
to  offer  animal  sacrifices;  but,  upon  inquiring  of  an  intelligent  Armenian 
in  the  Caucasus,  he  told  me  that  what  they  do  is  the  lingering  remnant 
of  a  heathen  practice  found  in  existence  by  the  early  teachers  of 
Christianity  in  the  Caucasus,  and  which  those  missionaries  did  not 
forbid ;  but  that  in  the  present  day  it  is  not  until  after  the  services  on 
their  great  festivals  that  the  people  slay  the  animals  they  have  brought, 
and  so  feast  together.

*' "  I  ^  URKISTAN,"  in  its  widest  acceptation,  signifies 
A       the  country  of  the  Turks,  and  is  bounded  on  the 
north  by  Russia,  on  the  west  by  the  Caspian,  on  the  east 
by  Mongolia  and  Tibet,  and  on  the  south  by  Hindustan 
and  Afghanistan.      That   portion  lying  between   the 
Thian   Shan  and  the  Karakoram  mountains  is  called 
Eastern  or  Chinese  Turkistan,  the  low  country  south 
of   Bokhara   is   sometimes   called   Afghan   Turkistan, 
whilst  the  Aralo-Caspian  depression,  with  which   we 
are  chiefly  concerned,  has  now  received  the  name   of 
Russian  Turkistan.     By  the  year   1867  Russian  con- 
quests in  Central  Asia  had  led  to  the  acquisition  of  so 
much   new  territory  that  it  appeared  desirable  to  the 
authorities  to  place  it  under  a  separate  administration, 
to  be  called  the  **  Government-General  of  Turkistan,''* 

*  This  was  formed  of  the  pre-existing  province  of  Turkistan,  the 
Tashkend  district,  the  country  occupied  in  i366  beyond  the  Jaxartes, 
and  that  part  of  the  Semipolatinsk  province  which   lies  to  the  south

which,    in   its  widest  extension,  consisted  of  the  pro- 
vinces  of  Semirechia,    Kuldja,    Syr-  and  Amu-daria, 
Ferghana,  and  Zarafshan.    It  is  well  to  remember  this, 
because  some  of  the   best  authors  upon   the  country 
wrote  during  this  golden  age,  if  I  may  so  call  it,  and 
in  their  mouths   Russian  Turkistan  means  this  wide 
extent  of  country   which   amounted  to  one-twentieth 
part  of  the  entire  Russian  Empire,*  and  exceeded  in 
area  each  of   the  other  first-class   states  of  Europe. 
I  shall  constantly  have  to  refer  to  **  Russian  Turkistan" 
in  this  wider  meaning,  but  it  should  be  borne  in  mind 
that  Kuldja  has  been  given  back  to  the  Chinese,  and 
Semirechia   forms  a  portion    of  the  general  govern- 
ment of  the  Steppe,  so  that  the  general  government 
of  Turkistan  now  includes  only  the  four  provinces  of 
Syr-daria  and  Amu-daria,   Ferghana,  and   Zarafshan. 
Its   greatest   breadth   along  the  43rd  parallel  is  750 
miles  ;  its  length,  on  the  84th  meridian,  is  460  miles  ; 
the    entire   area   of    the   vice-royalty   being    257,000 
square  miles,  or   the   extent  of  the  Austrian  Empire 
and  Switzerland.     It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  the 

of  the  Tarbagatai  range.  To  this  was  added  in  the  following  year  the 
Zarafshan  circle  with  the  town  of  Samarkand;  then  in  1871  the  Cis-Ili 
district,  with  the  town  of  Kuldja;  the  Amu-daria  section  in  1873  ;  and 
lastly,  in  1876,  the  Khanate  of  Khokand  was  annexed  thereto,  and 
renamed  as  the  province  of  Ferghana.

governments  of  Irgiz,  Turgai,  and  Akmolinsk  ;  on  the 
east  by  Semirechia  and  Kashgaria  ;  on  the  south  by 
Bokhara,  and  on  the  west  by  Khiva  and  the  Aral  Sea. 
The  surface  is  of  the  most  varied  character.  After  the 
Himalayas,  it  contains  some  of  the  highest  mountains 
in  the  world.  It  possesses  also  enormous  plains,  fruitful 
valleys,  and  barren  wastes,  as  well  as  sandy,  brackish, 
and  marshy  tracts.  If  Semirechia  be  included  in  the 
calculation,  more  than  half  the  soil  is  desert,  nearly  a 
half  is  pastured  by  nomads,  and  the  portion  under 
cultivation  is  only  2  per  cent,  of  the  whole.*  The 
province  of  Syr-daria  is  divided,  according  to  Kostenko, 
into  6  districts,  that  of  Ferghana  into  7,  whilst  the 
Zarafshan  province  is  composed  of  3  sections,  and  the 
Amu-daria  of  2  ;  making  18  in  all. 

The  climate  of  Russian  Turkistan  is  as  varied  as  its 
surface.  It  is  interesting  to  notice  in  the  first  place  its 
temperature  in  relation  to  other  parts  of  Asiatic  Russia. 
This  may  be  conveniently  studied  in  a  series  of  13 
charts,  published  in  an  atlas  by  Mr.  Wild  in  1881, 
giving  the  isothermal  lines  for  each  month,  and  for  the 
yearly  average.  On  the  chart  for  the  year,  two  things 
that  immediately  strike  the  eye  are  the  irregularities 
of  the  isotherms  in  the  region  of  Yakutsk,  and  their

curves  around  Lake  Baikal.*  Similarly  in  the  month  of 
March  the  isotherms  crossing  Turkistan  begin  to  drop 
on  approaching  the  Caspian,  and  this  feature  is  more 
marked  as  summer  approaches,  though  by  June  the 
lines  across  Russian  Central  Asia  are  tolerably  even. 
Speaking  generally,  observes  M.  R6clus,  the  Aralo- 
Caspian  slope  lies  between  the  isothermal  lines  of  68'' 
and  77""  in  the  month  of  July,  which  is  the  temperature 
of  the  Cape  Verde  Isles,  situated  1,700  miles  further 
south,  whilst  for  the  month  of  January  the  isothermal 
lines  for  the  Aral  region  are  those  of  23"^  and  s"*,  the 
same  as  pass  over  Canada,  southern  Greenland,  and 
the  isles  of  Spitzbergen.  The  difference  between  the 
temperature  of  the  hottest  and  coldest  days  is  still 
more  striking,  for  whereas  in  1881  at  Perovsk  the 
thermometer  fell  to  -17*86,  it  rose  at  Samarkand  to 
104*18,  a  difference  from  the  former  of  122*04°. 

The  chief  characteristic  of  the  climate  of  Turkistan 
is  its  peculiar  dryness.  Rain  in  the  summer,  except 
in  the  mountain  districts,  is  an  exceedingly  rare 
phenomenon,  as  the  reader  will  surmise  when  I 
observe  that  during  the  six  months  I  was  away  from 
London    I    did   not  unfold  my  waterproof  coat,   and 

♦  Thus  the  line  of  32**,  beginning  about  midway  between  the  north  and 
south  of  the  island  of  Sakhalin,  runs  westward  along  the  50th  parallel 
of  latitude  as  far  as  the  longitude  of  Nertchinsk ;  then  rises  slightly  as 
far  as  Verchne  Udinsk,  where,  instead  of  crossing  the  Baikal  in  a 
straight  line,  it  dips  to  nearly  the  southern  extremity  of  the  lake,  and, 
having  crossed  it,  rises  with  a  bound  along  the  western  shore  to  the 
58th  parallel,  whence,  continuing  westward  through  Tomsk,  it  crosses 
the  Irtish,  midway  between  Tara  and  Omsk,  on  its  way  to  Tobolsk.  All 
places  on  this  line,  therefore,  have  an  average  yearly  temperature  of 
32".  The  line  50**  has  not  the  same  irregularity ;  for  beginning  at 
Peking,,  it  travels  west  in  an  even  line  unaffected  by  Lake  Balkhash, 
or  the  Aral  and  Caspian  Seas,  and  deviates  northwards  when  it  has 
reached  the  north  of  the  Caspian,  only  to  the  extent  of  about  4' 
of  latitude.     The  chart  for  December  shows  the  deviations  first  alluded 


THE  GENERAL    GOVERNMENT  OF  TURKISTAN  7,y^ 

from  the  end  of  August  to  the  4th  of  December  I 
saw  no  rain.  In  1858,  according  to  M.  R^clus,  the 
total  duration  of  rainfall  in  the  Kara-Kum  desert  for 
the  whole  year  lasted  only  four  hours.  The  humidity 
brought  by  the  south-west  winds  is  deposited  upon 
the  Thian  Shan  and  Pamir  mountains,  but  in  smaller 
proportion  than  is  the  case  with  the  mountains  of 
Europe  or  of  India.  According  to  M.  Severtsoff's 
observations,  in  the  Thian  Shan,  north  of  the  42nd 
parallel,  at  heights  of  more  than  5,000  feet,  rain  falls 
daily  between  four  and  seven  in  the  afternoons  of 
May  and  June,  and  also  in  less  quantities  in  the 
night  and  early  morning.  At  heights  of  8,000  feet, 
throughout  the  summer,  rain  and  snow  succeed  each 
other,  but  the  latter  quickly  melts  ;  as  it  does  also 
from  1,000  to  1,500  feet  higher,  where  in  summer 
there  is  constant  snow  but  no  rain. 

The  summer  heats  of  Russian  Turkistan  are  in- 
tolerable, and  ascend  to  110°  in  the  shade,  and  135®  or 
145''  in  the  sun.  The  hot  period  south  of  Tashkend 
lasts  for  five  months,  and  for  about  three  in  the  district 
further  north. 

A  noteworthy  result  of  the  want  of  humidity  in  the 

to,  greatly  exaggerated,  and,  near  the  Baikal,  reversed ;  the  lines  now 
going  round  the  north  end  of  the  lake.  In  the  chart  for  March,  the 
line  of  14**  makes  a  capricious  curve  from  Yeneseisk  through  Tomsk, 
to  nearly  as  far  south  as  Akmolinsk,  and  then,  within  5**  of  longitude, 
ascends  10^  of  latitude,  running  north  to  Barentz  Island,  thus  giving  the 
same  degree  of  temperature  in  March  to  Akmolinsk,  that  is  on  the 
parallel  of  London,  and  to  an  island  15*  from  the  North  Pole.  Once 
more,  the  month  of  July  presents  great  irregularities,  the  line  of  68* 
commencing  in  the  Sea  of  Japan  as  far  south  as  the  38th  parallel,  and 
then  springing  on  the  same  meridian  of  longitude  no  less  than  24**  of 
latitude  to  Yakutsk,  gives  to  this  coldest  town  upon  earth  the  same 
temperature  as  to  the  coast  of  Korea,  after  which  the  line  descends 
to  the  south  of  the  Baikal,  and  proceeds  evenly  westwards.  The 
isotherms  across  Asiatic  Russia  from  August  to  November  are  even 
and  regular. 


374  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Turkistan  mountains,  valleys,  and  plains,  is  the  gradual 
drying  up  of  the  soil  during  the  present  geological 
period.  The  basins  of  the  Syr-  and  Amu-daria 
show  abundant  traces  of  this  process.  Here  are 
seen  old  river  beds  partially  filled  up,  and  numerous 
rivers  that  of  old  were  tributaries  of  some  principal 
stream,  now  stop  half-way  to  lose  themselves  in  the 
sands,  or  end  in  brackish  marshes.  Small  lakes  have 
evaporated  by  hundreds  and  by  thousands,  leaving 
behind  only  beds  of  salt.  Great  lakes,  like  the  Balk- 
hash, Aral,  and  the  Caspian,  have  shrunk ;  others  in 
the  mountains  are  partially  emptied,  like  Issik- 
Kul ;  whilst  some  have  disappeared,  like  those  now 
represented  by  the  plains  of  Kuldja  and  Ferghana. 
By  reason  of  this  continued  desiccation  a  large  portion 
of  the  country  has  been  transformed  into  steppe,  not 
only  in  the  lowlands,  but  also  in  the  mountains,  where 
a  depression  in  the  surface  is  often  a  steppe,  with  the 
vegetation  singularly  limited  both  as  to  the  number 
of  species  and  their  period  of  growth.  The  climate, 
in  fact,  in  such  cases  is  scarcely  more  favourable  to 
vegetation  than  the  Arctic  regions,  the  development 
of  the  plants  being  limited  to  about  three  months,  in 
the  north  by  the  snows  of  winter,  and  in  Turkistan 
by  the  dryness  of  the  summer.  Consequently  forests 
are  not  met  with,  even  in  the  mountains,  in  the  pro- 
vince of  Syr-daria.  It  is  only  towards  the  east  in 
Semirechia,  where  the  amount  of  river  water  is  com- 
paratively greater,  that,  as  I  have  already  said,  one 
meets  with  trees  in  any   number. 

The  Russians  are  expending  great  pains  in  taking 
observations  at  no  less  than  22  meteorological  sta- 
tions, but  since  many  of  them  date  only  from  1873, 
it  is  at  present   unsafe   to  make  positive  deductions 


THE  GENERAL   GOVERNMENT  OF  TURKISTAN  ^^ 

concerning  the  Turkistan  climate.*  We  must  have 
recourse,  therefore,  as  Colonel  Kostenko  points  out,  to 
observations  referring  to  the  life  and  locality  of  the 
vegetable  world,  to  enable  us  to  form  a  general  idea 
of  the  climate,  for  which  purpose  the  vice-royalty  may 
be  divided  into  four  tracts  or  zones,  distinguished  as 
the  northern  zone,  the  apricot  zone,  the  peach  and 
almond  zone,  and  the  zone  of  pistachio  nuts. 

The  first  zone  takes  in  the  whole  of  the  country 
above  the  45th  parallel,  including  the  lower  courses 
of  the  Syr-daria  and  the  Hi,  and  the  tract  north  of 
Kopal.  The  whole  of  this  extent  has  a  fairly  cool 
climate.  Hence  the  more  delicate  fruits,  as  apricots, 
vines,  etc.,  do  not  thrive  here.  Snow  lasts  for  two  or 
three  months  during  the  winter.  In  the  lowlands  of 
the  Syr-daria  snow  is  always  accompanied  by  stormy 
winds  from  the  north  or  west.  At  Fort  No.  i  the 
summer  lasts  5  months,  without  rain,  and  is  sultry  ; 
and  in  winter  the  river  is  frozen  there  for  123  days. 
The  average  winter  temperature  of  this  northern  zone 
is  about  equal  to  that  of  Russia  north  of  Petersburg. 

The  apricot  zone  lies  south  of  the  preceding  one, 
and  includes  Perovsk,  and  the  towns  of  Hazret, 
Aulie-Ata,  and  Vierny.  In  this  zone  the  winter  is  not 
so  protracted.  The  Syr  at  Perovsk  is  frozen  only  97 
days,  but  the  winds  blow  almost  as  violently  as  they 
do  further  north,  while  at  Aulie-Ata  and  along  the 
Alexandrof  and  Trans- Hi  Ala-Tau  ranges  the  winds 
are  noted  for  their  violence.  The  summer  heats  of 
this  tract  run  up  to  100**  in  the  shade,  and  the  cold 
reaches  22°  below  zero.  The  snow  lasts  for  two 
months,  and  the  winter  here  may  be  compared  with 
that  of  Central  Germany.

RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 


The  peach  and  almond  zone  comprises  the  towns 
of  Chimkent,  Tashkend,  Tokmak,  Ura-Tiube,  Jizakh, 
Samarkand,  Petro-Alexandrovsk,  Nukus,  and  the 
Kuldja  oasis.  In  this  tract  of  country  the  vine  is  but 
little  cultivated,  except  in  the  northerly  parts,  where  it 
is  covered  up  in  winter,  though  from  Tashkend  south- 
wards it  needs  not  to  be  so  protected.  Although 
Ura-Tiube,  Jizakh,  Samarkand,  and  Katte-Kurgan  lie 
considerably  to  the  south  of  Tashkend,  yet  ow  ng  to 
their  greater  altitude  they  all  enjoy  a  similar  climate. 

In  the  pistachio  nut  zone  is  included  the  valley  of 
Khojend  and  the  neighbouring  Khokand  mountains. 
The  character  of  this  tract  is  such  that  the  vine  may

of  the  growth  in  the  open  air  of  the  more  delicate 
plants  and  fruits.  The  average  winter  temperature 
is  about  the  same  as  that  of  Central  France,  though 
the  latter  is  some  5°  further  north. 

It  remains  to  be  noticed  in  connection  with  the 
climate  of  Turkistan,  that  fogs  are  frequent  only  in 
the  northern  portions,  especially  about  Sergiopol  and 
Kopal.  They  are  rarely  seen  in  summer — that  is, 
from  May  to  September — at  Tashkend.  The  aurora 
borealisy  or  Northern  Lights,  are  sometimes  visible  in 
Turkistan,  as,  for  instance,  on  the  night  of  the  4th 
and  5th  of  February,    1872.     On  each  occasion  they

appeared  at  lo  o'clock,  and  lasted  till  the  following 
morning.  The  light  was  of  a  red,  fiery  colour, 
and  imparted  a  roseate  tint  to  the  snow  that  covered 
the  ground.  Its  configuration  varied  but  slightly,  and 
though  it  was  more  clearly  defined  towards  the  north, 
where  it  reached  the  zenith,  it  was  visible  even  on  the 
southern  horizon. 

Earthquakes  in  Turkistan,  as  throughout  Central 
Asia  generally,  are  frequent,  especially  in  the  mountain 
region,  where  the  shocks  are  severe.  The  most 
violent  shocks  occur  towards  the  end  of  February,  and 
during  the  month  of  March.  In  Bokhara,  where  the 
new  year  is  held  to  begin  after  the  spring  equinox,  it  is 
believed  that  that  period  must  be  ushered  in  by  an 
earthquake.  Hence  the  **wise  men**  of  Bokhara  stick 
a  knife  in  the  ground  beforehand,  and  when  this  falls 
they  consider  themselves  in  a  position  to  meet  the  new 
year. 

Passing  to  the  geological  features  of  **  Russian 
Turkistan,"  I  may  observe  that  it  was  with  some  diffi- 
culty I  succeeded  in  finding  a  work  on  the  subject,  but 
did  so  at  last  in  the  brochure  of  M.  Mouchketoff  *  on 
the  mineral  riches  of  the  country.  Attached  thereto  is 
a  geological  map  drawn  up  by  the  author  from  his  own 

*  M.  Mouchketoff  complains  of  a  like  difficulty,  but  refers  to  the 
following  works,  the  enumeration  of  which  may  be  useful  to  the  geolo- 
gical reader : —

observations,  together  with  those  of  G.  D.  Romanov- 
sky.     In  this  map  the  Thian  Shan  mountains,  as  far 
east   as  the  82nd  meridian,  are  tinted,  to  show   the 
geological  features  of  the  region.     The  colouration  of 
the  low  country  between  the  Syr  and  Amu  denotes 
that  portion  to  be  of  Tertiary  and  Secondary  formations. 
Taking  the  country  as  I  passed  through  it  (in  which  I 
have  had  the  help  of  my  neighbour,  Mr.  Robert  Slater, 
F.G.S.),  it  appears  from  this  map  that  from  Sergiopol,  in 
the  neighbourhood  of  which  are  found  mines  of  graphite 
and  coal,  the  road  passes  in  a  southerly  direction  for 
some  60  or  70  miles  through  alluvial  deposits,  as  well 
as  Tertiary  and  Secondary  formations,  embracing  red 
marine   sandstone   of  the    Upper  Trias,    interspersed 
occasionally  with  Jurassic  and  Cretaceous  rocks,  show- 
ing that  there  have  been  several  eras  of  denudation 
and    deposition.     The    road    afterwards,    on    higher 
ground,  strikes    Metamorphic   Schists   and  Palaeozoic 
rocks,  whilst  Carboniferous  Limestone,  Devonian,  and 
even  Silurian  formations  are   occasionally   met   with, 
capped  by  mountain  chains,  towering  above  all,  com- 
posed   of    erupted    rocks,  such   as  Granite,    Syenite, 
Porphyry,    Diorite,    Diabase,     etc.,   across   and  along 
which  the  road  proceeds  in  a  south-westerly  direction 
to  the  River  Hi.     Near  its  valley  are  several  veins  of 
manganese,    lead,  copper,  and  iron. 

Crossing  the  river,  the  road  runs  a  little  south  of 
west,  over  a  spur,  and  then  at  the  base  of  a  chain  of 
granitic  and  palaeozoic  rocks  until  Chimkent  is  reached. 
Around  this  locality  are  found  deposits  of  Coal,  Iron, 
Silver,  Lead,  and  Rock  Salt,  whilst  in  some  few 
spots  Gold  is  found  in  workable  quantities.  The 
presence  of  these  minerals  is  sufficient  evidence 
of   the   geological    interest    attaching    to     a    country 


38o  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

whose    palaeontological    history    still    remains    to    be 
written. 

The  mineral  wealth  of  Central  Asia  made  it  one  of 
the  El'dorados  of  the  ancients.  Beneveni,  says  M.  Ker, 
sent  to  his  imperial  master  **  a  handful  of  sand  mixed 
with  gold  dust,  gathered  in  the  Lower  Oxus,"  and 
Minera  (who  penetrated  to  Balkh)  told  how  the  moun- 
taineers of  Badakhshan  **  sink  large  fleeces  of  wool  in 
the  sand  of  their  rivers,  and  after  a  while  dig  them 
up  covered  with  gold  dust "  ;  how  **  there  are  mighty 
treasures  of  gold,  silver,  and  musk  in  the  cities  of 
Kaskar  (Kashgar),  Dizan,  and  Margilian  **  ;  how  the 
river  that  flows  past  Samarkand  **  is  called  Zar-Affshan 
(gold-giving),  because  of  its  bringing  down  much  gold 
from  the  eastern  hills,"  and  so  forth,  the  truth  of  which 
tales  the  Russians,  upon  their  conquest  of  the  country, 
took  an  early  opportunity  of  examining,  with  the 
result  that  there  are  now  known  to  exist  in  Turkistan 
deposits  of  the  following  substances — namely,  Gold, 
Silver,  Lead,  Copper,  Iron,  Manganese,  Arsenic, 
Turquoise,  Agalmatolite,  Graphite,  Mineral  Oil, 
Petroleum,  Mineral  and  Lake  Salt,  Native  Sulphur, 
Sal  Ammoniac,  Alum,  Copperas,  Iron  Pyrites,  Por- 
phyry, Gypsum,  Marble,  Limestone,  Sandstone,  and 
Clay. 

Besides  limestone,  gypsum,  and  clay,  some  6,500 
tons  of  oil  are  obtained  annually,  of  which  three-fourths 
come  from  the  Kuldja  region,  and  the  remainder  from 
the  Syr-daria  territory.  The  Kuldja  district  likewise 
produces  about  5,000  tons  of  coal  a  year,  and  that  of 
the  Syr-daria  about  1,600  tons  more  ;  but  of  the 
other  useful  minerals,  notwithstanding  the  abundance 
and  diversity  of  the  deposits,  very  few  are  worked. 
Of  many  the  quality  is  far  from  being  uniformly  good. 


THE  GENERAL   GOVERNMENT  OF  TURKISTAN  i%\ 

and  in  some  cases  the  beds  are  so  inconsiderable  as 
scarcely  to  be  worth  the  attention  of  traders. 

Yet,  on  the  other  hand,  considerable  wealth  may 
undoubtedly  be  acquired.  Many  of  the  beds  of  valuable 
minerals  were  known  to  the  natives  before  the  coming 
of  the  Russians,  and  were  worked  by  them,  but  not  to 
any  great  extent.  With  the  arrival  of  the  Russians 
their  working  has  diminished ;  for  the  natives  have 
abandoned  their  works,  and  the  Russians  have  com- 
menced to  import  all  useful  minerals  from  Russia. 
The  low  condition  of  metallurgy  may  be  ascribed, 
Kostenko  says,  chiefly  to  the  sparse  population,  and 
the  limited  cultivation  of  the  soil.  The  roads  leading 
from  inhabited  localities  to  places  that  contain  minerals 
are  difficult,  whilst  the  small  number  of  people  in  the 
country  limits  the  demand.  It  is,  therefore,  more 
profitable  to  import  metals,  etc.,  than  to  establish 
furnaces  on  the  spot,  where  the  yield  would  not 
compensate  for  the  cost  of  production. 

Upon  the  incorporation  of  the  Turkistan  district 
into  the  Tsar  s  dominions,  numbers  of  Russians  vainly 
hurried  thither  in  search  of  gold.  The  fact  is,  that 
gold  exists  there  ;  for  the  natives  have  for  a  long  time 
past  found  it  in  the  sands  of  the  Chatkal,  the  Upper 
Chirchik,  the  Talas,  the  Hi,  and  the  Zarafshan,  but 
the  amount  of  the  precious  metal  thus  obtainable 
is  very  scanty,  and  could  only  pay  a  native  for  his 
trouble.  Indeed,  only  the  poorer  even  among  them 
are  employed  in  searching  for  it,  and  they  pay  no 
duties.  All  that  a  native  needs  is  a  ketnien,  or  wide 
and  round  iron  shovel,  fastened  at  right  angles  to  the 
shaft,  and  a  trough  to  act  as  a  cradle,  and  he  is  content 
if  he  earns  thereby  3^.  or  4^.  a  day.  But  with  the 
Russian  trader  it  is  very  different,  for  by  the  time  he 


382  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

has  expended  capital  upon  his  works,  instruments, 
and  dues,  he  has  paid  away  more  than  will  recoup 
him  for  the  outlay.  Gold  has  been  found  nowhere  in 
Turkistan  in  the  vein,  but  only  in  very  small  grains,  or 
pieces  not  bigger  than  a  pin's  head,  most  frequently  in 
the  form  of  dust.  The  richness  of  the  deposits  varies 
from  GO  I  to  0*017  grains  to  the  ton  of  sand.  In 
certain  places,  however,  in  the  Sungarian,  Ala-Tau, 
and   the  River  Tentek,  it  rises  to   1*23  grains. 

There  are  no  silver  mines,  properly  so  called,  in 
Russian  Turkistan,  but  silver  is  found  allied  with  lead 
in  veins  of  galena.  The  silver  contained  in  this  ore, 
whilst  not  exceeding  16 '8  grains  to  the  ton,  admits 
of  extraction  along  with  the  lead.  Others  of  the 
minerals  I  shall  have  occasion  to  refer  to  hereafter ;  but 
having  now  treated  of  certain  broad  features  of  the 
government-general  of  Turkistan,  I  shall  proceed  to 
describe  the  most  northerly  of  its  four  provinces.

THE  Syr-daria  province,  so  named  after  its  prin- 
cipal river,  extends  over  the  whole  of  the 
northern  portion  of  the  present  Turkistan.  It 
measures  636  miles  on  the  44th  parallel  from  east 
to  west;  and  the  post-road,  entering  at  the  north- 
west corner  and  passing  south-east  to  the  border  of 
Semirechia,  traverses  1,000  miles.  The  area,  which 
occupies  two-thirds  of  the  entire  government-general,, 
extends  to  182,000  square  miles,  or  the  size  of  Norway, 
Sweden,  and  Denmark.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north 
by  the  districts  of  Irgiz  and  Turgai,  and  the  govern- 
ment of  Akmolinsk ;  on  the  east  by  Semirechia  and 
Ferghana ;  on  the  south  by  the  districts  of  Zarafshan 
and  Amu-daria;  and  on  the  west  by  the  Sea  of 
Aral.     It   includes,   in   fact,  the   basins  of  the  middle 


384  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

and  lower  Syr-daria  and  Chu  rivers,  with  the  eastern 
shore  of  the  Sea  of  Aral.  The  province,  for  the 
most  part,  is  flat,  the  western  spurs  of  the  Thian 
Shan  occupying  only  a  relatively  small  portion  of  its 
surface.* 

The  surface  of  the  Syr-daria  province  may  be 
divided  into  four  zones — namely,  of  deserts,  steppes, 
oases,  and  mountains.  Of  these  the  first  is  by  far 
the  most  extensive,  and  includes  the  huge  desert  of 
Kyzyl- Kum,  between  the  Syr  and  Amu  rivers;  the 
Kara-Kum,  north-east  of  the  Aral  Sea ;  and  Ak,  or 
Muiun-Kum,  almost  filling  the  space  between  the  Chu 
and  the  Kara-Tau  mountains.  How  large  a  proportion 
of  the  province  is  desert  may  be  estimated  from  the 
fact  that  out  of  its  entire  area  of  about  a  million  square 
miles,  more  than  half  are  waste  lands,  400,000  square 
miles  are  pastured  by  the  nomads,  and  only  8,000 
square  miles  are  under  cultivation  ;  or,  to  put  the 
same    thing  in  another  way,  out  of  every   100  acres 

*  The  Alexander  range  extends  into  the  Syr-daria  province,  as  I 
have  stated,  and  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  sources  of  the  Talas, 
the  Talasky-Ala-Tau  is  detached  from  the  Thian  Shan  mass,  and 
stretches  westwards  to  the  sources  of  the  Aris,  north-east  of  Chimkent. 
Running  ofi  thence  to  the  north-west  is  the  Kara-Tau  chain,  whose 
western  slopes  the  traveller  from  Orenburg  sees  from  Julek  after 
passing  Perovsky.  The  mountain  heights  of  the  Kara-Tau  range  do 
not  exceed  from  5,000  to  6,000  feet,  and  in  summer  are  free  from  snow, 
thus  giving  rise  to  their  name  of  Kara-Tau^  or  **  Black  mountain.** 
The  south-western  slopes  of  the  chain  are  steep,  whilst  the  central 
mass  consists  of  an  elevated  plateau  with  deep  valleys.  The  most 
elevated  portions  of  the  range  lie  west  of  the  River  Kamir-7i2i-,  and  rise 
to  7,000  feet.  These  mountains  are  crossed  by  many  passes,  of  which 
the  Turlan  Pass  is  at  an  altitude  of  6,800  feet.  South-west  of  the  Ala- 
Tau  are  the  Chatkal  mountains,  some  of  the  ramifications  of  which  con- 
stitute the  frontier  between  the  provinces  of  Syr-daria  and  Ferghana, 
whilst  its  principal  spurs  separate  the  Chirchik  basin  from  that  of  the 
Jaxartes.  After  shutting  in  with  its  northern  spurs  the  Chirchik  valley, 
the  Chatkal  range  breaks  out  into  numerous  second-rate  ridges  known 
as  Kendir-Tau  and  Kurama-Tau,  which  separate  the  Kurama  district 


THE  SYR'DARIA   PROVINCE.  385 

57   are   waste,    42    are   pasture,    and   less   than    i    is 
cultivated. 

Not  only  the  Syr-daria  province,  but  the  entire 
government-general  is  comprised  in  the  Aral  basin, 
in  which  the  two  largest  rivers  are  the  Syr-daria  and 
Amu-daria.  To  the  same  depression  also  belong  the 
Sari-Su  and  Chu,  which  flow  towards  the  Syr,  but 
are  lost  in  the  sands.  To  the  same  basin  also 
belong  the  rivers  Talas,  Ters,  and  Asu,  which  flow 
in  the  same  direction  as  the  Chu. 

It  is  evident,  says  Colonel  Kostenko,  that  the  Sea 
of  Aral  and  lakes  Balkhash,  Ala-Kul,  and  Ebi-Nor 
once  formed  one  united  basin.*  Whether  it  was  from 
geological  causes,  or  from  the  effect  of  evaporation, 
that  the  Sea  of  Aral  became  separated  from  Lake 
Balkhash  is  not  known.  Only  a  chain  of  lakes,  bogs, 
and  salt  marshes  now  mark  the  former  connection, 
but  the  firm  soil  between  the  two  is  obviously  a 
subaqueous  formation. 

The  rivers  of  Turkistan  have  several  interesting 
peculiarities.  They  flow  in  a  north-westerly  direction, 
yet  their  lower  courses,  as  in  the  cases  of  the  Syr, 
Talas,  and  Chu,  curve  towards  the  east.  Again,  their 
right  banks  are  steeper  than  the  left,  because  the 
mountain   ranges   that   hem   in    both   banks  of  their 

from  Ferghana.  The  most  western  end  of  the  Kurama-Tau  continues 
to  the  bed  of  the  Syr,  north  of  Khojend,  and  is  called  the  Mogul-Tau. 
Between  this  and  the  Kurama-Tau  my  route  lay  on  the  postal  road 
from  Tashkend  to  Khojend. 

♦  Professor  Romanoff,  however,  denies  this,  at  any  rate  during  the 
pleistocene  period.  He  says  that,  at  this  period,  the  belt  of  tertiary 
tableland,  which,  with  the  Kara-Tau  range,  evidently  formed  the  north- 
east shore  of  what  was  then  the  Sea  of  Aral,  would  have  hindered  any 
connection  between  that  sea  and  Lake  Balkhash.  But  the  Professor 
admits  that,  at  a  much  earlier  period,  the  Turanian  lowland  presented 
avast  water  basin,  comprising  what  are  now  the  basins  of  the  Caspian, 
the  Aral,  and  Lake  Balkhash. 

VOL.  L  25 


386  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Upper  courses  continue  to  skirt  the  right  bank  only 
after  the  rivers  reach  the  plains.  This  is  seen  in  the 
Chu,  the  Karatal,  and  the  Syr  below  Khojend.  The 
Turkistan  rivers  are  all .  remarkable  for  their  velocity. 
Hence,  on  changing  from  mountain  torrents  to  steppe 
streams,  they  continue  to  flow  at  a  rapid  rate.  Fed 
by  the  snows,  they  are  from  spring  until  the  middle  of 
summer  surcharged  with  water,  the  bulk  of  which, 
however,  often  sinks  within  twenty-four  hours.  Some 
of  the  mountain  streams,  that  are  impassable  from  noon 
till  morn,  are  fordable  from  dawn  to  midday. 

The  direction  of  the  Turkistan  rivers  is  not  favour- 
able for  commercial  utility,  since  the  caravan  trade 
routes  cross  rather  than  skirt  them.  The  roads  from 
Khiva,  Orenburg,  and  Petropavlovsk  are  more  than 
once  intersected  by  the  Amu  and  Syr,  whilst  those 
leading  from  Bokhara  are  also  similarly  crossed  by 
the  Syr.  Consequently  the  natives  have  never  used 
these  rivers  as  a  means  of  communication.  It  was 
not  until  1847  that  the  Russians,  appearing  at  the 
mouth  of  the  Syr,  converted  it  into  a  route  for 
advancing  into  Central  Asia.  Whether  the  Syr  and 
Amu  will  ever  become  trade  routes  is  exceedingly 
doubtful.  They  are,  however,  navigable,  as  are  the 
Zarafshan  and  Chu. 

The  great  river  of  our  province,  to  whose  basin  all 
the  others  belong,  is  the  Syr-daria,  that  was  known 
to  the  Greeks  under  the  name  of  the  Jaxartes,  and 
to  the  Asiatics  as  the  Sihun,  but  concerning  which 
we  had  little  geographical  information  before  1850. 
Its  whole  course  now  runs  through  Russian  territory, 
and  Colonels  Maief,  Kostenko,  and  others  have  in 
recent  years  supplied  full  information  about  it* 

*  The  S)rr  is  composed  of  two  affluents,  the  Naryn  and  Kara-daria. 


THE  SYR-DARIA  PROVINCE.  }fil 

The  Syr  is  of  copious  volume,  and  flows  in  a 
south-westerly  direction  along  the  Ferghana  valley, 
but  without  any  of  its  water  being  appropriated  to 
human  needs.  Not  a  single  canal  is  diverted  there- 
from in  this  locality,  for  it  flows  through  a  barren 
and  uninhabited  country.  The  Upper  Syr,  as  far  as 
Khojend,  a  distance  of  133  miles,  allows  of  timber 
rafts  being  floated  down  in  summer,  at  which  season  of 
the  year  the  river  is  not  fordable,  but  is  crossed  at  six 
points  in  ferry-boats.  At  Khojend  the  river  descends 
in  rapids  as  far  as  Fort  Irjar,  below  which  point  naviga- 
tion is  once  more  possible,  and  the  water  again  becomes 
deep,  copious,  and  of  extraordinary  velocity.  Below 
Chinaz  the  banks  are  steep,  and  the  water  close  by  is 
7  feet  deep,  but  the  bed  is  not  without  shallows. 

From  Chinaz  to  Fort  Perovsk,  a  distance  of  more 
than  400  miles,  the  river  flows  between  low  banks  that 
are  submerged  when  the  waters  rise,  and  are  trans- 
formed into  reed-grown  swamps  from  1,000  yards  to 
3  or  4  miles  in  breadth.* 

The  former  is  considerably  larger  than  the  latter  in  length,  volume, 
and  number  of  tributaries,  and  so  claims  to  be  the  parent  stream,  but 
the  latter  aligns  more  with  the  course  of  the  main  river.  The  Naryn 
rises  near  Issik-Kul  in  Semirechia,  the  Kara-daria  in  the  Osh  district 
of  the  province  of  Ferghana,  and  the  two  unite  in  the  centre  of  the 
Ferghana  valley,  8  miles  south  of  Namangan,  from  which  point  the 
river  is  called  the  Syr.  The  Kara-daria  is  formed  of  two  streams,  the 
Kara-Kuldja  and  the  Tar,  of  which  the  latter  is  the  longer — namely,  90 
miles,  which,  added  to  *]2>  n^iles  from  the  spot  whence  the  stream  is 
called  the  Kara-daria,  make  this  affluent  of  the  Syr  upwards  of  160 
miles  long.  The  upper  course  of  the  Naryn  comprises  three  main 
branches,  the  largest  of  which  issues  from  underneath  a  majestic 
glacier.  All  three  streams,  before  they  unite,  receive  a  large  number 
of  small  affluents.  They  together  form  the  Kara-Jai,  and  keep  this 
name  until  joined  on  the  right  bank  by  the  Kurmenti,  when  the  river 
gets  the  name  of  Naryn,  and  so  rolls  on  till  it  joins  the  Kara-daria 
and  makes  up  the  Syr.  The  whole  valley  of  the  Naryn  from  its  source 
to  this  point  is  466  miles  long. 

*  The  width  of  the  river  below  Chinaz  varies  from  300  to  900  yards, 


388  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

Ten  miles  below  Perovsk  the  Syr  divides  into 
two  streams,  the  Yaman-daria  and  the  Kara-Uziak. 
Hence  the  Yaman-daria,  or  bad  river,  is  the  principal 
channel,  but  becomes  shallow  in  consequence  of  the 
division  of  the  stream,  so  that  at  low  water  a  boat,  with 
a  draught  of  2  feet,  is  only  able  to  navigate  it  with 
difficulty.  This  lack  of  water  in  the  Yaman-daria  is 
the  chief  obstacle  to  the  development  of  navigation 
on  the  Jaxartes.* 

The  Syr  gives  off  several  branches,  that  after  being 
nearly  drained  by  irrigation  canals,  end  in  swamps. f 
The  passage  of  the  river  is  not  everywhere  possible, 
because  the  banks  in  some  places  are  not  approachable, 

and  the  depth  is  seldom  less  than  21,  and  often  as  much  as  35  feet. 
The  rapidity  along  the  main  stream  reaches  4J  miles  an  hour,  but  varies 
greatly.  The  water  is  muddy,  but  clears  quickly,  and  is  pleasant  to  the 
die  taste.  It  is  said  to  have  the  property,  however,  if  used  continuously 
for  washing,  of  making  the  hair  fall  off.  The  bottom  of  the  river  is  chiefly 
composed  of  mud  and  sand,  though  rocky  in  places.  From  the  mouth 
of  the  Arys  to  Uch-Kayuk  the  tortuous  course  of  the  river  gives  rise 
to  many  islands,  some  of  them  being  2  miles  long.  There  are  three 
principal  inundations,  the  first  in  March,  after  the  thaw  of  the  ice  ;  the 
next  in  May,  at  the  melting  of  the  mountain  snows ;  and  the  third  in 
June,  which  is  the  greatest ;  but  these  floods  are  not  always  regular. 

*  The  other  branch  of  the  Jaxartes  is  quite  unnavigable,  and  spreads 
out  into  a  large  number  of  reed-grown  lakes.  At  Fort  No.  2  the  two 
streams  reunite,  and  are  again  called  the  Syr-daria,  which,  from  Fort 
No.  2  to  its  mouth,  has  a  straight,  deep  channel  accessible  to  boats  of 
considerable  draught. 

The  embouchure  of  the  Syr  forms  three  estuaries,  of  which  the  central 
stream  is  the  principal,  but  here  the  shoals  are  still  more  in  the  way  of 
the  passage  of  vessels  than  in  the  Yaman-daria.  At  low  water  the 
main  channel  is  not  more  than  2  or  2\  feet  deep,  and  at  high  water 
only  from  3^  to  4  feet.  The  left  arm  of  the  S)rr  is  blocked  up  and 
overgrown  with  rushes,  and  the  right  arm  is  almost  the  same.  The 
banks  are  of  saliferous  clay.  The  silting  up  of  the  mouths  of  the 
Jaxartes  is  the  river's  own  doing,  and  is  produced  by  deposits  of  sand 
and  mud,  which  also  have  formed  the  island  of  Kos-Aral,  covering 
the  entrance  of  the  river  into  the  sea. 

t  It  receives  two  principal  affluents,  the  Yengi-daria  and  Kuvan- 
daria,  of  which  the  former,  according  to  tradition,  was  formed  arti- 


THE  SYR'DARIA   PROVINCE,  389 

but  the  stream  can  be  crossed  at  all  forts  by  means  of 
ferry-boats,  etc.  The  Kirghese  use  also  reed-rafts  and 
native  boats  dragged  by  swimming  men  or  horses. 
The  lower  banks  of  the  Jaxartes  are  infertile  and  un- 
cultivated, and  only  south  of  Julek  do  fields  begin,  and 
then  only  in  places,  until  the  town  of  Hazret  or 
Turkistan  is  reached. 

Passing  from  water  communication  to  communication 
by  land,  the  roads  of  the  province  are  found  to  be  of 
two  kinds — namely,  for  caravans  and  for  wheeled 
vehicles,  the  former  of  ancient  date,  the  latter  of 
Russian  introduction.  The  traveller  from  Petersburg, 
who  would  speed  to  Tashkend  as  quickly  as  possible, 
reaches  Orenburg  by  rail  in  60  hours,  after  which,  with 
post-horses,  he  trots  beside  the  River  Ural,  a  distance 
of  175  miles,  to  Orsk,  where  he  leaves  the  Orenburg 
province,  and  continues,  a  distance  of  259  miles,  to 
Irgiz,  the  capital  of  the  province  of  Turgai,  whose 
frontier  is  only  65  miles  distant.  At  Julius  begins 
the  Syr-daria  oblast,  and  the  road  skirts  the  western 
edge  of  the  Kara-Kum  desert,  touching  the  north-east 
corner  of  the  Sea  of  Aral,  till,  having  driven  162  miles, 
he  arrives  at  the  fifteenth  station  in  the  province, 
called  Kazalinsk,  formerly  Fort  No.  i. 

This  fortress  had  considerable  importance  in  days 
gone  by,   and  round  it  sprang  up  a  population  that 

ficially  at  the  end  of  the  last  century,  when  the  Karakalpaks,  driven 
from  the  lower  part  of  the  Syr  by  the  Kirghese  of  the  Little  Horde, 
had  to  seek  a  fresh  locality.  They  quickly  dug  a  large  canal,  from 
which  was  formed  a  branch  of  the  Syr,  called,  at  first,  Karakalpak- 
daria,  and  afterwards  Yengi-daria,  or  New  River.  From  iChojend  to 
its  mouth  the  Syr  has  not  a  single  affluent  on  its  left  bank,  but  on  its 
right  bank  there  enter,  besides  small  streams,  three  very  large  rivers, 
the  AriSi  Chirchik,  and  Angren.  The  Syr  is  closed  by  frost  at  Kazala, 
near  its  mouth,  for  4  months  in  the  year;  at  Perovsk  3^  months; 
at  Chinaz  for  3  weeks ;  but  at  Khojend  rarely  at  all. 


390  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

made  the  place  the  market  town  of.  the  steppe. 
Kazalinsk  has  now  3,000  inhabitants,  and,  being 
situated  at  the  junction  of  the  Khivan,  Bokhariot,  and 
Tashkend  caravan  routes,  is  a  place  of  considerable 
trade,  and  the  chief  post  on  the  River  Syr.  Not  far 
distant  are  the  ruins  of  the  ancient  town  of  Janekend. 
After  leaving  Kazalinsk,  or  Fort  No.  i,  the  road 
keeps  company  with  the  Syr  a  distance  of  1 1 7  miles, 
and  past  seven  stations  to  Karmakchi,  or  Fort  No.  2, 
whence  it  makes  a  detour  to  the  left  of  the  marshes, 
called  Bakali  Kopa,  to  the  ninth  station,  distant  119 
miles,  at  Perovsk.  This  was  originally  a  Khokandian 
fort  and  town  called  Ak-Mesjed  (white  mosque),  which 
in  1853  was  captured  by  the  Russians  under  General 
Perovsky,  and  the  place  called  after  his  name.  It  is 
now  a  town  of  3,000  inhabitants,  peopled,  like  Kaza- 
linsk, by  Kirghese,  but  having  also  an  element  of 
Sarts. 

For  the  next  72  miles  to  Julek  the  road  passes  six 
stations  through  a  district  abounding  in  game,  after 
which  the  monotony  of  the  steppe  is  relieved  by  the 
beautiful  outlines  of  the  Kara-Tau  mountain  range. 
Four  stations,  or  60  miles  further,  bring  the  traveller 
to  Yani-Kurgan,  the  great  interest  of  this  portion  of 
the  road  being  its  adjacent  ruins.  An  old  legend  says 
that  the  valley  of  the  Syr  was  once  so  thickly  settled 
that  a  nightingale  might  fly  from  branch  to  branch  of 
the  fruit-trees,  and  a  cat  walk  from  wall  to  wall  from 
Kashgar  to  the  Sea  of  Aral.  The  numerous  traces  of 
old  canals  give  some  colour  to  the  story  at  this  part  of 
the  river  bank.  Here  once  were  large  and  flourishing 
towns,  and  noticeable  amongst  them  were  Otrar,  the 
place  of  Tamerlane's  death,  Savran,  and  J  end. 

It  is  on  arriving,  however,  at  the  fifth  station,   78 


THE  SYR'DARIA   PROVINCE,  391 

miles  further,  that  the  great  monument  of  these  parts 
looms  in  view,  the  famous  mosque  of  Hazret  Khoja 
Akhmed  Yasavi,  in  the  city  of  Turkistan,  commonly 
called  *'  Hazret."  The  building  was  commenced  by 
Tamerlane  in  1397,  over  the  tomb  of  Sheikh  Akhmed 
Yasavi,  who  died  about  1 1 20,  the  founder  of  the  sect 
Jahria.  He  is  the  patron  of  the  Kirghese,  and  one 
of  the  most  celebrated  saints  in  Central  Asia.  The 
city  of  Turkistan  has  now  a  population  of  only  5,000, 
and  contains  little  of  interest  except  the  mosque.  A 
journey  of  102  miles  further,  at  the  seventh  station, 
brings  the  traveller  to  Chimkent,  the  chief  town  of  the 
uyezd.  The  steppe,  undulating  at  this  portion  of  the 
road,  is  in  spring  rich  in  flowers. 

At  Chimkent  the  post-road  branches  westwards  to 
Semirechia,  and  continues  south  to  Tashkend.  Thence 
it  bifurcates,  leading,  on  the  right,  through  Chinaz  and 
Jizakh  to  Samarkand,  and  on  the  left  through  Khojend 
and  Ura-Tiube  to  Jizakh.  As,  I  traversed  most  of  the 
road,  however,  beyond  Chimkent,  I  shall  describe  it 
in  the  course  of  my  travels,  merely  observing  here  that 
the  length  of  the  post-roads  throughout  the  Syr-daria 
province  amounts  to  1,450  miles,  the  road  being  every- 
where accompanied,  if  I  remember  rightly,  by  telegraph 
lines.  Besides  the  post-roads  of  the  province  there  is 
a  great  caravan  route  from  Khiva  to  Kazalinsk,  with  a 
branch  going  off  to  Perovsk,  another  going  north-west 
from  Hazret  to  Turgai,  and  a  third  to  the  north- 
east, bifurcating  to  Atbasar  and  Akmolinsk.  Besides 
these  are  many  small  longitudinal  caravan  routes,  with 
scarcely  one,  however,  going  in  a  lateral  direction. 

The  peoples  of  Russian  Turkistan,  as  Kostenko 
observes,  are  of  two  races,  the  Caucasian  and  the  Mon- 
golian.    The  Caucasian  group  has  two  branches,   the 


392 


RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 


Aryan  and  the  Semitic,  to  the  former  of  which  belong 
the  Russians  and  Iranians.  Of  Iranians  also  there  are 
two  branches, — namely,  the  Iranians  of  the  Upper  Oxus, 
called  Tajiks,  who  are  descended  from  the  aborigines  of 
Bactriana,  Trans-Oxus,  and  Sogdiana,  and  the  Iranians 
proper — namely,  the  Persians  and  the  Afghans,  the 
Hindus  and  the  Gypsies.  The  Mongolian  race,  in  its 
turn,  is  divided  into  two  branches,  the  Turko-Tatar 
people  of  the  Altai  and  the  pure  Mongols.  To  the 
first  belong  the  Kazaks,  the  Kara-Kirghese,  Uzbegs, 
Karakalpaks,  Kipchaks,  Turkomans,  and  the  Tatars. 
To  the  second  belong  the  Kalmuks,  Chinese,  Sibos, 
Solons,  and  some  others.* 

The  Sarts,  the  Taranchis,  and  Kuramas  are  a 
mixture  of  several  races,  but  may  be  numbered  among 
the  Turco-Tatar  races,  since  Sarts  and  Taranchis, 
in  type  and  language,  resemble  the  Uzbegs  ;  whilst 
the  Kuramas  resemble  the  Kirghese.     The  Dungans

serve  to  connect  the  Turkish  and  Mongol  races,  but  in 
type  they  resemble  more  closely  the  Turks,  and  are 
therefore  better  classified  as  such.  Thus  it  will  be 
seen  that  in  Turkistan  the  Turk  peoples  predominate. 
The  Kirghese  are  the  most  numerous,  then  come  the 
Sarts,  but  after  this,  owing  to  the  difficulty  of  obtaining 
accurate  statistics,  the  relative  numbers  of  the  peoples 
are  somewhat  doubtful,  but  Kostenko  places  them  in 
the  following  order  :   Uzbegs,  Tajiks,  Kuramas,  Kip- 


chaks,  Russians,  Karakalpaks,  Taranchis,  Kalmuks, 
Manchus,  Dungans,  Tatars,  Turkomans,  Persians, 
Hindus,  Jews,  and  Gypsies." 

The  civil  population  of  the  Russians  forms  about 
I  per  cent,  of  the  people  of  Turkistan  and  Semirechia, 
in  which  latter  they  are  principally  grouped,  and  where 
the  Russian  element  forms  7  per  cent,  of  the  entire 
population  of  the  province.t 

•  See  pp.  394-5  \a). 

t  In  the  Syr.daria  province  they  number  8  per  cent.,  and  are  chiefly 
centred  in  Tashkend  (5,000  souls)  and  Kazalinsk  (about  1,500},  few 
being  found  in  other  towns  of  the  same  province.     In  the  Zarafshan 


394 


RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 


With  regard  to  the  natives  I  have  already  described 
the  Kazaks  and  the  Kara-Kirghese  ;  the  Sarts  I  shall 
describe  hereafter,  as  I  saw  them,  and  other  peoples 
in  connection  with  the  localities  they  inhabit.  The 
Kuramas,  however,  should  be  noticed  here,  because, 
with  the  exception  of  a  village  in  Ferghana,  between 
Andijan  and  Namangan,  they  are  confined  to  the 
Syr-daria  province,  and  live  along  the  Chirchik  and 
Angren.  They  number  77,000  souls.  Kostenko  calls 
them  simply  Settled  Kirghese.* 

Passing  now  to  classifications  of  the  population,  we 
find  that  Muhammadanism  is  the  belief  of  the  mass 
of  the  people  in   Russian  Turkistan.     The  Christians 

district  they  number  4,000  souls,  or  about  i  per  cent.  In  the  Amu-daria 
section  the  same  element  numbers  a  population  of  1,184,  ^^  whom  the 
greater  portion  are  exiled  Cossacks  from  the  Ural,  and  in  the  Ferghana 
province  there  were  in  1876  Russians  to  the  number  of  1,229. 

*  Ujfalvy,  however,  pronounces  them  a  mixture  between  Kirghese, 
Uzbegs,  and  Sarts,  calls  them  an  ugly  race,  regarded  as  inferiors  by 
their  neighbours,  and  says  that  when  an  Uzbeg  becomes  sedentary, 
without  mixing  with  Sarts  or  Tajiks,  he  presents  a  number  of  physical 
characteristics  that  bring  him  strikingly  close  to  the  Kuramas.  The  Kir- 
ghese, who  have  mixed  with  the  Sarts,  have  lost  all  tradition  of  their  own 
origin,  and  have  borrowed  what  civilization  their  new  neighbours 
possessed,  but  without  losing  that  frankness  and  sympathetic  nature

come  next  in  number,  then  the  Pagans,  and  last  of 
all  the  Jews.*  A  noticeable  feature  of  the  Turkistan 
population  is  that  the  male  sex  far  outnumbers  the 
female ;  whereas  in  Europe  the  preponderance  is  of 
females  over  males.  This  abnormality  in  Turkistan 
is  not  accounted  for  by  the  existence  of  troops,  for 
among  the  natives  also  there  is  a  marked  preponder- 
ance of  the  same  kind.  As  to  the  progress  of  the 
Turkistan  population,  it  would  appear,  according  to 
Kostenko,  that  it  increases  at  the  rate  of  3  per  cent, 
per  annum.  The  birth-rate  among  the  natives  is  high, 
and  though  the  death-rate  also  is  considerably  above 
that  of  European  nationalities,  yet  the  percentage  of 

that  distinguish  the  Kirghese.  The  Kuramas  are  among  the  most 
capable  and  industrious  of  the  Turkistan  races.

actual  increase  is  thrice  as  great  as  the  increase  of 
European  Russia,  where  it  only  amounts  to  i  per 
•cent. 

The  annexation  of  fresh  countries,  and  the  coloniza- 
tion of  them  by  Russians,  and  by  natives  who  come 
from  neighbouring  states,  during  a  period  of  1 1  years, 
increased  the  population  in  a  three-fold  degree,*  in 
connection  with  which  Kostenko  points  out  that  the 
freshly-occupied  provinces  not  only  added  to  the 
effective  population  of  the  country  by  nearly  60  per 
cent.,  but  that  the  relative  positions  of  the  settled  and 
nomad  races,  under  Russian  rule,  became  reversed,  t 

The  density  of  the  Turkistan  population  amounts 
to  only  7  per  square  mile,  the  thickest  population 
being  found  in  the  Zarafshan  district,  and  next  in 
that  of  Ferghana.  In  the  valley  of  Ferghana  there 
are   26,  and  in  that  of  Zarafshan,  35   to  the  square

population,  whilst  in  1877  the  nomads  were  less  than  the  settlers  by 
200,000  souls,  having  sunk  to  47  per  cent,  of  the  entire  population. 
Also  it  is  found  that  the  increase  of  the  settled  population  advances 
more  rapidly  than  that  of  the  nomads.

mile.  The  population  of  the  valley  of  the  Hi  may  be 
compared  with  that  of  the  Zarafshan,  and  a  fair  number 
of  inhabitants  are  found  on  the  banks  of  the  Chirchik, 
Angren,  and  Keles,  where  there  is  abundance  of  water 
to  assist  the  labours  of  the  agriculturist ;  but  the  bare 
mountain  tracts  and  the  sandy,  waterless  steppes  are 
given  up  to  the  nomads.  There  are  many  places,  how- 
ever, in  Turkistan,  such  as  the  valleys  of  the  Aris,  Talas, 
and  Chu,  that  could  well  support  a  larger  number  of 
both  nomads  and  settlers  than  they  now  possess. 

Throughout  Turkistan  the  density  of  population  is 
higher,  naturally,  where  the  settled  element  prepon- 
derates ;  *  whilst,  as  regards  locality  of  the  population, 
the  number  of  inhabitants  in  the  towns  is  373,382, 
and  outside  the  towns  1,247,153  settlers,  and  1,417,584

compares  the  cultivated  region,  consisting  of  Zarafshan,  Ferghana,  and

IN  two  previous  chapters  I  have  indicated  the  series 
of  events  beginning  in  the  reign  of  John  the 
Terrible,  whereby  the  Russians,  in  taking  possession 
of  the  Irtish,  were  brought  into  contact  successively 
with  the  Barabinsky  Tatars,  the  Kalmuks  of  Sungaria, 
and  the  Chinese  of  Western  Mongolia  ;  and  how,  as 
they  continued  to  the  Balkhash  region  and  the  Thian 
Shan,  they  secured  the  submission  of  the  Kazaks  of 
the  Great  Horde  and  the  Kirghese  of  the  mountains, 
first  coming  in  contact  with  the  Khokandians  near 
Viemy.  I  have  now  to  describe  in  outline  the  succes- 
sive stages  by  which  the  Muscovites  received  from 
the  Bashkirs  the  country  between  the  Volga  and  Ural 
rivers,  how  they  then  advanced  through  the  steppes 


THE  RUSSIAN  ADVANCE  TO  THE  SYR-DARIA,  401 

of  the  Kirghese  of  the  Lesser  Horde  to  the  Sea  of 
Aral,  and  came  into  contact  with  the  Khokandians 
on  the  lower  portions  of  the  Jaxartes  or  Syr-daria. 

The  swarms  of  Mongol  and  Turkish  barbarians  who 
invaded  Eastern  Europe,  under  Jinghis  Khan  and 
Tamerlane,  left  behind  them  a  number  of  khanates 
and  petty  kingdoms,  some  of  whom  exacted  tribute 
from  Russia,  and  most  of  whom  quarrelled  with  each 
other.  During  the  reign  of  Ivan,  or  John,  III.,  the 
"  Golden  Horde,"  whose  head-quarters  were  at  Sarai 
on  the  Volga,  still  arrogated  to  themselves  the  right  of 
exacting  tribute,  but  their  rivalry  with  the  Tatars  of 
Kazan  and  the  Crimea  enabled  the  Russians  to  act  in 
combination  with  these  latter  powers  and  paralyze  the 
oppressor's  strength.  Assisted  by  the  Tatars  of  the 
Crimea,  Ivan  III.  tore  up  his  written  agreement  with 
the  Khan  of  Sarai,  and  forcibly  ejected  his  ambas- 
sadors ;  and  when  the  main  bodies  of  the  combatants 
at  last  confronted  each  other  on  the  opposite  banks  of 
the  River  Ugra, — Sarai  having  been  destroyed  by  the 
Russians, — so  little  stomach  had  either  party  for  the 
fight,  that  on  the  7th  November,  1480,  the  two  armies 
broke  up  without  a  battle,  and  from  that  day  the  rule 
of  the  barbarians  may  be  said  to  have  ceased. 

The  Tatars  of  Kazan,  thus  delivered  from  a  trouble- 
some neighbour  in  the  east,  perpetrated  without 
ceasing  predatory  raids  on  the  Russian  borders,  which 
led  to  Kazan  being  brought  under  the  Russian  yoke. 
The  Kazanians,  however,  availed  themselves  of  every 
opportunity  to  repudiate  their  subjection.  Before  this, 
certain  distinguished  Tatar  princes,  called  **  Moorzas," 
had  emigrated  to  Russian  territory  ;  and  when,  in  the 
year  1518,  the  throne  of  Kazan  became  vacant,  the 
Tsar  nominated  a  Moorza  named  Sheikh-Ali  as  suc-

cesser,  but  the  Kazanians  would  none  of  him.  So  they 
revolted,  and  placed  upon  the  throne  a  Crimean  prince 
named  Edegar.  Accordingly  Ivan  IV.  resolved  once 
and  for  all  to  crush  Kazan,  which  he  did  with  150,000 
Russians,  who  laid  siege  to  and  took  the  city,  having 
breached  the  walls  by  what  was  then  the  novel  expe- 
dient of  a  mine  containing  48  barrels  of  gunpowder. 
This  occurred  in  1552,  and  to  the  Khanate  of  Kazan 
thus  incorporated  into  Russia  was  added,  four  years 
later,  the  powerless  Khanate  of  Astrakhan  that  had 
sprung  up  on  the  ruins  of  the  Empire  of  the  Tatars. 

It  was  towards  the  end  of  the  reign  of  Ivan  IV. 
that  Yermak  crossed  into  Siberia,  and  commenced  a 
conquest  that  in  a  single  lifetime  extended  all  across 
Asia.  But  things  went  more  slowly  further  south. 
Russia  had  advanced  her  border  to  the  Volga,  but 
there  lay  between  that  and  the  Ural  river  the  country 
of  the  Bashkirs,  who  had  formerly  been  tributary  to  the 
Kazanians.  The  Bashkirs  tendered  their  submission 
to  the  new  conquerors,  but  did  not  desist  from  jnaking 
incursions  into  the  territory  of  Russians,  who  were 
thus  compelled  to  fortify  their  frontier  settlements,  and 
to  make  an  uninterrupted  line  of  earthworks  from 
village  to  village.  In  1574  the  Bashkirs  voluntarily 
petitioned  for  the  construction  of  a  Russian  town  in 
their  country,  and  with  the  foundation  of  Ufa  and 
Samara  Bashkiria  became  permanently  attached  to 
Russia,  whilst  the  Don  Cossacks,  who  in  the  sixteenth 
century  had  settled  on  the  River  Ural,  or  Yaik,  as  it 
was  called,  swore  fealty  to  the  Tsardom  of  Moscow  on 
the  accession  of  Michael  Fedorovitch  in  161 3. 

Russia  had  now  annexed  the  territories,  and  put 
down  the  incursions  of  two  predatory  peoples,  but  only 
to  find  that  she  had  a  third  beyond  that  was  just  as 


THE  RUSSIAN  ADVANCE  TO  THE  SYR-DARIA.  403 

bad,  for  east  and  south  of  the  Ural  mountains  lived 
the  roaming  Kirghese-Kazaks,  who  at  this  time  were 
united  under  a  khan  living  in  the  city  of  Turkistan ; 
their  territory  extending  laterally  to  the  Irtish,  and 
bounded  on  the  south  and  west  by  the  Thian  Shan 
.  mountains,  the  Khanates  of  Khokand,  Bokhara,  and 
Khiva.  Neither  the  internal  condition  of  Russia  nor 
the  political  circumstances  of  the  period  imparted  any 
significance  to  the  movement  of  the  Muscovites  east- 
ward. Peter  the  Great,  however,  with  characteristic 
penetration,  perceived  the  importance  and  significance 
for  Russia  of  the  Trans- Volga  region,  and  when  in 
Astrakhan  in  1722  is  reported  to  have  said:  ** Although 
these  Kirghese  are  a  roaming  and  fickle  people,  their 
steppe  is  the  key  and  gates  to  all  the  countries  of 
Central  Asia."  Ever  on  the  watch  for  the  opening 
of  new  Russian  trade  routes  to  the  east,  and  incited, 
perhaps,  by  the  report  of  Prince  Gagarin  concerning  the 
fabulous  riches  of  Central  Asia,  the  great  Peter  not  only 
ordered  spies  to  be  sent  thither  by  way  of  the  Irtish  to 
Yarkand,  but  despatched  also  Lieutenant  Bukholtz,  in 
1 7 1 6,  to  survey  the  Caspian,  and  to  find  out  whether  there 
was  a  water-way  through  Central  Asia  to  India.  In  the 
same  year  also  Prince  Bekovitch  Tcherkassky  was  sent 
to  inspect  the  rivers  Jaxartes  and  Oxus,  and  to  subju- 
gate to  Russia  the  Khans  of  Bokhara  and  Khiva,  Shah 
Kniaz  of  Khiva  having  declared  his  readiness  to  accept 
Russian  sovereignty  16  years  before. 

Peter  did  not  succeed,  however,  in  realizing  his 
cherished  plans,  and  bequeathed  to  his  successors  the 
work  of  first  bringing  the  Kirghese  to  acknowledge 
their  subjection  to  Russia.  Nominally  this  took  place 
five  years  after  the  great  Tsar's  death  ;  actually  it  took 
scores  of  years  to  accomplish. 


404  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

So  early  as  1 718  the  Kirghese,  pressed  by  the  Kal- 
muks,  or  Sungarians,  sought  assistance  of  Russia,  which 
she  was  not  then  able  to  give,  and  hence  came  the  dis- 
placement of  tribes  in  the  Steppe.     The  Sungarians, 
in    1723,  captured  the   town  of  Turkistan,   occupied 
the  valley  of  the  Syr-daria,  and  drove  the  Kii^hese  of 
the  Lesser  Horde  to  the  north-west,  in  the  direction 
of  the   rivers   Emba   and    Ural.      Here   they    found 
themselves  in  dangerous  proximity  to  their  old  and 
implacable  foes,   the    Kalmuks,    Bashkirs,  and    Kara- 
kalpaks,   who   incessantly   disturbed   the   auls   of  the 
Lesser  and  Middle  Hordes  of  the  Kii^hese.     These 
latter,  however,  made  an  effort  under  a  leader  Bukan 
Bai,  drove  back  the  Bashkirs  and  Kalmuks  to  the  Urals, 
and  occupied  the  northern  part  of  the  Steppe  on  the 
borders  of  Russia.     At  this  time  Abul-Khair  asked 
that  the  Lesser  Horde,  of  which  he  was  Khan,  should 
be  taken  under  Russian  sovereignty  ;  but  this  was  not 
the  wish  of  the  people  generally,  though  at  a  national 
assembly  in    1732   the   Kirghese   of  the    Lesser   and 
Middle   Hordes   were   persuaded   to   submit.      From 
this    compact    the   latter    Horde    immediately   broke 
away,  but  the  Lesser  Horde  was  removed  along  with 
its  Khan  to  the  lower  valley  of  the  Jaxartes,   where 
they   showed   their   respect   for    their    protectors   by 
plundering    Russian   and    Bokharan    caravans    indis- 
criminately, though  two  years  later  the  Khans  of  the 
two  Hordes  again  tendered  their  submission. 

In  order  that  this  subjection  should  involve  practical 
results  it  was  necessary  to  remove  the  Russian  boundary 
further  southwards,  and  on  the  organization  of  the 
south-eastern  frontier,  in  1735,  a  fortified  town  called 
Orenbui^  (removed  to  its  present  locality  in  1742), 
was  built  on  the  site  of  the  existing  town  of  Orsk,  and 


THE  RUSSIAN  ADVANCE  TO  THE  SYE-DARIA.  405 

made  the  head-quarters  of  a  military  Governor.  A 
fortified  line  of  Cossack  settlements  was  established, 
extending  both  up  and  down  the  River  Ural,  so  that 
ultimately  it  reached  from  the  Tobol  in  the  north-east 
to  the  Caspian  in  the  south-west.  This  proved  of 
use  in  quelling  the  insurrections  of  the  Bashkirs  from 
within,  by  cutting  off  their  retreat  into  the  Steppe, 
but  was  quite  insufficient  for  the  repression  of  the 
nomads  without,  who  made  prisoners  of  the  people, 
and  plundered  caravans  almost  at  their  pleasure. 
This  condition  of  things  was  fostered  by  the  enmity, 
already  alluded  to,  of  the  tribes.  After  one  of  the 
Bashkir  rebellions,  in  1755,  some  of  the  insurgents 
fled  to  the  Steppe  for  shelter,  where  they  were 
remorselessly  hunted  like  wild  beasts  by  the  Kirghese, 
who  sold  their  wives  and  children  into  slavery,  and 
caused  the  death  of  about  50,000  persons,  only  a  few 
succeeding  in  making  their  way  back  to  the  European 
side  of  the  Urals.  In  turn,  the  Bashkirs  for  a  long 
time  terribly  avenged  this  massacre  on  the  Kirghese. 

Again,  in  1764,  the  Kirghese  of  the  Lesser  Horde 
attacked  the  Kalmuks  on  the  ice  of  the  Caspian,  and 
took  700  prisoners,  among  whom  were  several  Russians. 
Seven  years  later  the  Torgout  Kalmuks  fared  still 
worse  in  their  celebrated  flight  from  the  Volga  to 
the  number  of  30,000  kibitkas,  when  the  Kirghese 
pitilessly  spoiled  them  as  they  crossed  the  Steppe, 
and  allowed  but  a  weak  remnant  to  reach  the  Hi. 

These  disorders  were  anything  but  favourable  to 
the  development  of  the  country,  nor  was  it  until  the 
commencement  of  the  present  century  that  trade 
relations  were  set  on  foot  with  Khokand  and  Bokhara. 
Murders  and  robberies,  however,  soon  suspended  this 
trade,  and  the  Russian  administration  was  too  weak 


4o6  RUSSIAN  CENIRAL  ASIA. 

to  bring  the  offenders  to  justice,  so  that  practically 
it  may  be  said  that  for  a  century  the  Kirghese  were 
the  most  turbulent  of  subjects. 

Of  course  there  was  a  cause  for  this  unwillingness 
on  the  part  of  the  Kirghese  quietly  to  submit  to 
Russian  authority,  which  M.  N.  Maieff*  attributes 
largely  to  mistakes  in  administration.  The  govern- 
ment was,  so  to  speak,  taken  unawares,  in  1732,  on 
the  submission  of  the  Kirghese,  and  on  many  occa- 
sions acted  at  random,  having  no  trustworthy  infor- 
mation concerning  the  affairs  of  the  Steppe,  and  not 
understanding  the  habits  and  aspirations  of  the  people. 
When  Abul-Khair  swore  fealty  he  stipulated  that  under 
the  new  regime  the  Kirghese  Khans  should  be  selected 
from  his  heirs ;  and  Russia,  in  acceding  to  this,  sowed 
the  seeds  of  lasting  discontent ;  for  according  to  the 
immemorial  customs  and  ideas  of  the  Kirghese,  the 
dignity  of  Khan  should  have  passed  to  his  brother. 
Then,  again,  the  governors  at  Orenburg,  when  appoint- 
ing a  new  Khan,  were  less  anxious  about  his  being  a 
favourite  with  the  people  than  his  devotion  to  Russian 
interests.  It  often  happened,  therefore,  that  the  Khan, 
not  having  the  good  will  of  the  people,  could  enforce 
his  command  only  by  the  help  of  the  Russian  authori- 
ties. The  government,  moreover,  were  not  assisted 
by  the  various  institutions  they  introduced  among  the 
Steppe  people,  who  were  not  acquainted  with  Russian 
administrative  formalities.  Hence  the  establishment 
of  a  frontier  expedition  in  1782,  a  frontier  court  two 
years  later,  and  an  arbitration  court  in  1787  led  to 
no  good  results.  The  people  regarded  their  Khans 
not  as  national  chiefs,  but  as  foreign  inspectors,  and

compiling  this  chapter. 


THE  RUSSIAN  ADVANCE  TO  THE  SYR-DARIA,  407 

the  guardians  of  foreign  interests;  and  for  a  period 
of  fourscore  years,  from  1732  to  1812,  showed 
their  dissatisfaction  by  constant  disorders  and  pillage  ; 
and,  wherever  possible,  grouped  themselves  in  factions 
around  popular  leaders,  who  were  naturally  opposed 
to  Russian  interests. 

In  181 7,  Essen,  the  Military  Governor  of  Orenburg, 
initiated  a  new  policy ;  for,  seeing  the  weakness  and 
incapability  of  a  certain  Khan  Shirgazi,  he  entered  into 
relation  with  the  Khan's  opponents,  and  so  tried  to 
win  the  popular  favour,  till,  about  1833,  ^^e  dignity  of 
Khan  was  abolished  altogether,  and  the  whole  Steppe 
was  divided  into  three  rayons,  or  districts,  the  adminis- 
tration of  which  was  confided  to  three  native  **  Sultan- 
rulers."  Here  again  no  attention  was  paid  to  the 
electoral  principle  long  firmly  established  in  the 
Steppe,  nor  was  a  national  council  appointed  to  control 
the  sultans*  actions,  but  to  each  sultan  was  given  a 
detachment  of  200  Cossacks  for  assistance  in  the  pre- 
vention of  pillage,  whom  he  did  not  fail  to  employ 
to  his  own  advantage.  The  sultans  grew  rich  by 
their  unjust  exactions,  and  the  Kirghese  expressed  their 
discontent  in  their  own  way  by  plunder  and  extortion, 
incited  thereto,  it  is  said,  by  the  Khivans,  who  bought 
of  them  for  slaves  their  Russian  captives. 

At  first  it  was  hoped  that  the  Kirghese  would  be 
subdued  by  sending  after  them  flying  detachments  to 
punish  them  for  their  robberies,  but  the  culprits  usually 
managed  to  escape  into  the  frontier  tracts  of  Bokhara 
or  Khiva.  It  was  then  decided  that  when  caravans 
went  into  the  Steppe  they  should  be  accompanied  by 
a  military  escort,  and,  in  1824,  the  first  caravan  pro- 
ceeded to  Bokhara  with  a  guard  of  500  men,  but  was 
nevertheless  met  by  the  Khivans  and  plundered. 


408  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

This  led  to  a  new  line  of  action,  or  rather  to 
a  return  to  an  old  one ;  for  in  order  to  diminish  the 
depredations  and  incursions  from  which  the  Russian 
fisheries  in  particular  suffered,  the  first  fort,  called 
Novo-Alexandrovsk,  was  founded,  in  1834,  on  the 
north-east  coast  of  the  Caspian,  whilst  for  the  defence 
of  other  frontiers  a  continuous  rampart  was  commenced 
like  a  miniature  Chinese  wall,  that  was  to  extend  along 
the  Steppe  frontier  in  places  where  there  was  no  natural 
protection.  In  1836,  the  formation  of  this  earthwork 
had  extended  1 2  miles,  after  which  it  was  abandoned. 

It  now  seemed  clear  to  the  Russians  that  so  long  as 
their  territories  did  not  possess  a  definite  natural 
boundary  it  would  be  useless  to  expect  a  secure 
frontier.  The  only  adjacent  rivers,  however,  were  the 
Syr-daria  and  the  Chu,  to  the  former  of  which,  accord- 
ing to  Terentief,  the  Kirghesehad  invited  the  Russians 
to  advance  so  far  back  as  the  time  of  Abul-Khair,  who 
'*  begged  the  Russians  over  and  over  again  to  build  a 
fort  at  the  mouths  of  the  Syr-daria,  the  Kirghese 
desiring  to  have  a  point  of  support  in  the  midst  of 
their  own  camping  grounds,  as  well  as  a  market  where 
they  might  be  able  to  purchase  manufactured  goods 
and  dispose  of  their  own  raw  produce.**  To  this  end  a 
detachment  was  sent  under  Gladyshef,  in  1 740,  to  look 
for  a  suitable  spot  for  a  fortress ;  but  there,  for  the  time, 
the  matter  ended,  till  a  century  later  Obrucheff  reverted 
to  the  old  system  that  had  been  tried  with  the  Bashkirs, 
namely,  to  encircle  the  Kazaks  by  a  chain  of  forts. 

In  1847  the  Steppe  was  agitated  by  an  insurrection 
of  the  Kirghese  under  a  popular  leader,  Kenisar 
Kasimoff,  around  whom  the  discontented  flocked  in 
crowds,  and  hence  in  this  year  were  built  the  Oren- 
burg   fort   on    the  Turgai,  and  the  Ural   fort  on  the 


THE  RUSSIAN  ADVANCE  TO  THE  SYR-DARIA,  409 

Irgiz,  to  which  must  be  added,  in  1848,  the  Karabutak 
fort  on  the  Karabut,  constructed  for  protecting  the 
communication  between  the  Steppe  forts  and  the  line. 

This  advance  of  Russia  in  the  Steppe  had  the  effect 
of  pacifying  the  districts  adjoining  the  Hne,  but  exer- 
cised no  influence  over  those  Kirghese  who  roamed 
beyond  the  Emba,  on  the  Ust-Urt  and  the  Syr-daria. 
Russia,  therefore,  conceived  it  necessary,  in  order  to 
make  her  influence  felt  by  the  Khanates  of  Central 
Asia,  who  were  said  to  foment  the  Kirghese  insubor- 
dinations, as  well  as  for  the  protection  from  unjust 
exactions  of  the  Kirghese  subject  to  her,  and  for  the 
safety  of  Russian  caravans,  to  lord  it  without  a  rival  on 
the  Sea  of  Aral,  and  at  the  mouth  of  the  Syr,  where 
the  Khokandians  and  Khivans  had  erected  a  line  of 
forts  to  intimidate  the  Kirghese. 

In  1846  General  Obrucheff^  then  Governor-General 
at  Orenburg,  obtained  the  sanction  of  his  Government 
to  establish  a  stronghold  with  a  Russian  settlement  on 
the  shore  of  the  Sea  of  Aral.  This  was  done  in  the 
following  year,  and  the  fortification  was  called  Raimsk, 
though  its  name  was  afterwards  changed  to  Aralsk. 

With  the  erection  of  this  fort  commenced  the  navi- 
gation of  the  Sea  of  Aral  by  Russian  vessels.  Early 
in  1847,  ^wo  ships  were  constructed:  one,  a  vessel 
of  war,  the  Nlcolai ;  the  other,  a  merchant  ship,  the 
Mikhail ;  the  first  being  intended  for  surveying  pur- 
poses, the  second  for  establishing  fisheries,  with  which 
object  a  public  company  had  been  formed  the  same 
year.  Both  vessels,  having  been  constructed  at  Oren- 
burg, were  taken  to  pieces,  and  transported  in  the 
spring  600  miles  overland  to  Raimsk,  where  they  were 
put  together  again,  and  launched.  Shortly  afterwards, 
a   larger   war   vessel,  the    Constantine^    was    built    at 


410  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Orenburg,  in  which  Lieutenant  Butakoff  commenced, 
in  1 848,  a  thorough  survey  of  the  Sea  of  Aral. 

In  1850  General  Obrucheff  proposed  to  construct  a 
steamer  of  forty  horse-power  for  the  purpose  of  plying 
on  the  Syr-daria,  to  carry  goods  from  Khokand  terri- 
tory that  otherwise  had  to  be  carried  across  the  Steppe. 
This  steamer,  and  a  screw  steam  barge  to  act  as  tender, 
were  ordered  in  Sweden.  Meanwhile  difficulty  arose 
respecting  fuel,  for  no  coal  could  be  found  in  the 
immediate  vicinity  of  the  Aral  Sea,  and  the  use  of 
saxaul  did  not  answer  well.  Ultimately  it  was  decided 
to  transport  Don  anthracite  to  the  Orenburg  line  for 
consumption,  in  1852;  at  a  cost  of  about  ;^I2  a  ton. 
This  was  done,  and  the  steamer  Perovski,  with  the 
barge  Obrucheff,  were  launched  on  the  Syr-daria  in 
1853,  ^he  total  expenditure  being  about  ;^7,500. 

Meanwhile  the  Russians  were  consolidating  their 
advance  by  the  introduction  to  the  Steppe  of  their  own 
forms  of  administration.  Up  to  181 2,  as  I  have 
shown,  they  interfered  very  little  with  the  internal 
life  of  the  Kirghese,  being  only  too  thankful  if  they 
could  prevent  their  incursions,  and  secure  trade  rela- 
tions with  Central  Asia.  The  Khans  acted  almost 
independently  until  that  dignity  was  abolished,  and  it 
was  nearly  the  same  with  the  Sultan  Governors,  who 
secured  so  little  sympathy  from  the  people  that  it  was 
necessary  in  their  summer  peregrinations  to  travel 
with  a  whole  sotnia  of  Cossacks. 

In  1837  a  tax  of  3^.  per  tent  was  imposed  on  the 
Orenburg  Kirghese,  which  was  less  than  that  paid  by 
their  Siberian  kinsmen  on  the  Irtish,  though  eventually 
it  was  found  possible  to  introduce  Siberian  regulations 
and  institutions  further  west.  In  1844,  the  Kirghese 
along  the  Russian  frontier  line  were  placed  under  the 


THE  RUSSIAN  ADVANCE  TO  THE  SYR-DARIA,  411 

orders  of  special  protectors,  selected  from  Russian 
officials,  and,  in  1848  and  1849,  the  whole  Kirghese 
Steppe  was  divided  into  54  '*  distances,"  in  each 
of  which  was  a  chief  and  secretary,  besides  the  native 
authorities,  all,  however,  being  subject  as  before  to 
the  '*  sultan  rulers."  Also  a  part  of  the  Steppe,  along 
the  banks  of  the  Syr-daria,  was  placed  under  military 
administration.  In  1859,  the  administration  of  the 
Steppe  was  transferred  to  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior, 
and  so  continued  for  five  years,  till  the  Kirghese  of 
the  Syr-daria  were  transferred  to  the  Ministry  of 
War  in  1864,  at  which  time  the  government  of  the 
Steppe  underwent  a  radical  change. 

Concurrently  with  these  changes  the  Russian  criminal 
laws  were  by  slow  degrees  introduced,  those  laws  being 
of  course  adapted  to  local  circumstances.  To  this  end 
a  special  commission  was  formed,  whose  labours  termi- 
nated in  1868,  with  the  issue  of  certain  regulations,  on 
the  basis  of  which  all  the  lands  occupied  by  the  Kirghese 
nomads  were  proclaimed  as  Imperial,  and  reserved  for 
the  exclusive  public  use  of  the  Kirghese,  and  the  rights 
of  all  Kirghese  in  the  general  Imperial  service  were 
assimilated  to  the  rights  of  the  ordinary  rural  popula- 
tions of  the  Empire.* 

For  certain  crimes,  such  as  treason,  murder,  high- 
way robbery,  intertribal  robbery,  and  making  counter- 

♦  The  land  thus  given  to  them  as  a  community  is  divided  into  winter 
encampments  [kishlau  or  ktshlaks)  and  summer  encampments  {djailau 
or  lailaks)f  the  enjoj-ment  of  both  being  grounded  on  hereditary  right. 
The  apportionment  of  land  among  families  is  effected  by  an  authorita- 
tive meeting  of  representatives,  and  made  according  to  the  number  of 
cattle  possessed  by  each  family.  The  permanent  possession  of  land 
is  arranged  between  neighbouring  owners,  landmarks  being  used  to 
prevent  boundary  disputes,  which,  when  they  arise,  are  settled  by  an 
assembly  of  arbitrators,  who  occasionally  require  a  person  to  be  swoni 
in  to  confirm  his  right  of  ownership. 


412  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

feit  coin,  the  Kirghese  were  made  amenable  to  the 
general  criminal  code  of  the  Empire,  but  for  tribal 
matters  they  retained  their  native  courts.* 

Notwithstanding  the  efforts  of  the  Russians  to  intro- 
duce civilization  and  order  into  the  Steppe,  it  was 
many  years  before  they  succeeded.  When  Fort  Raim 
was  built  in  1847,  ^^^  Government  endeavoured  to 
make  friends  with  two  well-known  batyrs.  or  popular 
favourites  of  the  day,  Jan-Khoja  and  Iset-Kutebaroff. 
Jan-Khoja  at  first  helped  the  Russians  against  the 
Khokandians,  but  his  fidelity  was  undermined  by  the 
intrigues  of  the  sultans,  and,  in  1856,  he  appeared  at 
the  head  of  the  Kirghese  rebels,  who  attacked  the 
Russian  forts,  drove  off  the  herds,  and  burnt  the  stores 
of  hay  and  fuel.  He  was  at  length  quelled,  and  died 
in  1 860,  the  third  national  defender. 

The  other  batyr,  Iset-Kutebaroff,  soon  broke  loose 
from  his  patrons,  and  pillaged  on  so  extensive  a  scale 
that  the  Orenburg  authorities  had  more  than  once  to 
send  a  considerable  detachment  of  troops  against  him. 
He  usually  evaded  his  pursuers  by  escaping  to  the 
Ust-Urt,  but  at  length  gave  himself  up.  He  was 
deported  to  Petersburg,  pardoned,  and  sent  back  as  an 
assistant  uyezd  chief,  but  was  always  of  doubtful  loyalty. 

*  It  is  interesting  to  notice  that  cattle  constitutes  almost  exclusively 
the  object  of  theft  among  the  Kirghese,  who  hardly  reckon  theft  as  a 
crime,  and  repair  the  loss  by  exchange  of  cattle.  Should  cattle  that 
have  strayed,  or  any  other  object,  be  found  with  a  man  who  professes 
the  intention  to  pay  for  it,  he  must  be  able  to  produce  evidence  thereof 
or  run  the  risk  of  being  accused.  Generally  speaking,  the  loss  and  legal 
costs  are  borne  by  the  offender,  or,  if  he  cannot  pay  them,  his  nearest 
relatives  are  called  upon  to  do  so.  If  caught  thieving  a  second  time 
the  offender  becomes  liable  to  corporal  punishment,  and  a  known  thief 
is  put  under  the  surveillance  of  the  tribe.  A  highway  robbery  by  an 
armed  man  is  punished  over  and  above  the  restoration  of  the  stolen 
property  by  the  loss  of  the  offender's  horse  and  weapons. 


THE  RUSSIAN  ADVANCE  TO  THE  SYR-DARIA.  413 

Thus  between  1732  and  1864  may  be  distinguished 
five  different  measures  taken  for  the  consolidation  of 
Russian  power  and  influence  in  the  north-west  portion 
of  the  Steppe — namely,  the  appointment  as  khans  of 
the  heirs  of  Abul-Khair;  the  subsequent  suppression 
of  the  rank  of  Khan,  and  the  substitution  of  sultan 
rulers  ;  the  erection  of  fortifications  on  the  Yaik  or 
Russian  line  to  consolidate  Russian  power  ;  the 
erection  of  forts  on  the  Syr-daria,  to  cut  off  the 
Kirghese  from  Khivan  and  Khokandian  influence ; 
and,  lastly,  the  introduction  of  civil  administration  on 
the  Russian  model. 

It  now  remained  only  to  connect  the  forts  on  the 
Syr-daria  with  those  of  Semirechia,  completely  to 
surround  the  Kirghese,  the  doing  of  which  introduces 
us  to  the  Russian  occupation  of  Khokand,  whose 
people,  of  course,  could  not  regard  with  indifference  the 
encroachment  of  her  northern  neighbour  on  the  Lower 
Syr-daria,  But  this  story  must  form  the  subject  of  a 
subsequent  chapter,  the  way  to  which  I  shall  gradually 
lead  by  continuing  my  journey  to  Tashkend,  and 
describing  the  former  Khokand  provinces.

direction  for  30  miles,  and  drank  tea  at  the  third 
station,  Tersk,  on  the  stream  of  that  name.  We 
were  now  approaching  the  watershed  that  sends 
its  rivers  on  one  side  into  the  Talas,  and  on  the 
other  into  the  Jaxartes.  The  surface  here  and  there 
was  somewhat  uneven,  as  we  were  reminded  at  one 
spot  by  the  driver,  who  coolly  suggested  our  getting 
out,  informing  us  that  he  was  going  to  dash  down  a 
place  where  it  was  very  possible  our  coach  might 
upset.  The  vehicle  came  to  no  harm,  however,  and 
we  had  a  pleasant  evening's  drive,  the  horizon  to  the 
left  being  bounded  by  one  of  the  western  spurs  of  the 
Thian  Shan,  the  Talasky  Ala-Tau.  This  district  was 
visited  by  Mr.  Severtsoff,  to  whom  the  scientific  world 
is  indebted  for  much  information  respecting  the  zoology 
of  Turkistan.  We  saw  examples  of  bird  life  as  we 
drove  along  ;  but  rather  than  notice  these  in  particular, 
I  prefer  to  speak  for  a  moment  of  the  birds  of  Russian 
Turkistan  generally. 

Among  diurnal  birds  of  prey  are  found,  in  various 
parts  of  the  country,  the  Himalayan  Laemmergeyer, 
and  five  species  of  Vultures;  about  a  dozen  kinds  of 
Eagles  ;  the  Osprey  ;  six  kinds  of  Buzzards ;  Black 
and  Brahminy  Kites  ;  the  Goshawk  and  Sparrow-hawk  : 
the  Saker  and  Peregrine  Falcons,  Merlin,  and  Hobby ; 
likewise  the  Kestrel,  Lesser  Kestrel,  and  Orange-legged 
Hobby,  which,  with  4  kinds  of  Harriers,  make  up  a 
list  of  36  species  of  this  order.  The  Kirghese  train 
some  of  these  birds  to  hunt,  not  only  smaller  birds,  but 
even  wild  beasts.  Only  the  day  before  writing  these 
words.  Dr.  Sclater,  the  Secretary  of  the  Royal  Zoo- 
logical Society  of  London,  told  me  that  Baron  Benoist 
M6chin  had  lately  arrived  from  Central  Asia,  bringing 
one  of  these  trained  birds,  and  a  Kirghese  to  attend  it. 


4i6  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

Of  nocturnal  birds  of  prey  are  found  9  species  of 
Owls.  Corvine  birds  prevail  to  the  number  of  about  1 3 
species,  including  the  Cornish  and  Alpine  Choughs 
that  are  interesting.  More  particularly  they  are  the 
Raven  and  Brown-necked  Raven,  Carrion  and  Hooded 
Crows,  Jackdaw,  Rook,  the  Bactrian  and  White- 
winged  Magpies,  the  Nutcracker,  Pander's  Podoces^ 
Rose-coloured,  Common,  and  Purple  Starlings. 

The  Finch  family  comprises  no  less  than  40  species, 
with  one  new  species  of  sparrow  {Passer  Ammodendri)^ 
named  by  Severtsoff,  and  found  in  the  salt  plains  of 
north-west  Turkistan.  Then  follow  the  White-winged 
Grossbeak, Greenfinch,  Brambling, Chaffinch,  Snowfinch^ 
and  Gray-crowned  Finch ;  two  kinds  of  Linnet ;  the 
Twite,  Mealy  Redpoll,  the  Himalayan  and  European 
Goldfinch,  Red-fronted  Finch,  the  Eastern  Bullfinch, 
and  eight  species  of  Grossbeak ;  White-browed  and 
Meadow  Buntings,  the  Ortolan,  and  11  other  kinds 
of  Bunting,  two  of  them  being  found  throughout  the 
country  and  in  the  loftiest  districts  below  the  perpetual 
snow-line.  The  Yellow  and  White-capped  Buntings 
have  not  apparently  been  found  so  high. 

The  Thrush  family  is  represented  in  Turkistan  by  the 
Blackbird,  Black-throated  and  Mistletoe  Thrushes, 
Fieldfare,  Redwing,  and  some  two  or  three  more 
besides  the  Common  and  Blue  Thrush.  Some  9  or 
10  species  of  Wheatear,  including  that  so  well-known 
in  England,  the  Whinchat  and  Stonechat,  of  which 
last  there  is  also  a  local  race,  begin  the  family  of 
Warblers,  of  which  more  than  40  others  are  found  in 
the  country.  Many  of  these  are  well  known  in  Western 
Europe,  as  the  Greater  Nightingale,  the  Bluethroat, 
Redstart,  Redbreast,  Barred  and  Orphean  Warblers, 
both  Whitethroats,  both   Reed- Warblers,   Savi's,  and 


FROM  AULIE-ATA    TO  TASHKEND.  417 

the  Grasshopper- Warbler,  besides  the  Golden-crested 
Wren  and  the  Yellow-browed  Warbler,  which  last 
occasionally  strays  to  this  country.  The  Hedge- 
Sparrow  does  not  occur,  apparently,  in  Turkistan,  but 
3  or  4  allied  species  are  found  there. 

Six  species  of  the  Titmouse  family  are  found  in 
Turkistan,  only  one  of  which,  the  well-known  Oxeye, 
is  common  to  England,  but  the  Bearded  Reedling, 
often  referred  to  this  group  of  birds,  occurs  there  as 
well.  Two  species  of  Dipper  are  found  throughout 
the  country.  Other  small  birds  are  the  Nepalese  and 
European  Wrens,  the  Syrian  Nuthatch,  Wall-  andTree- 
Creepers,  and  no  less  than  10  forms  of  Wagtails.  Of 
Pipits  there  are  7  species,  and  14  of  Larks.  There 
are  also  10  kinds  of  Shrikes ;  the  Golden  Oriole  and 
Waxwing ;  the  Spotted  and  Red-breasted  Flycatcher ; 
the  Swallow  and  Red-rumped  Swallow ;  Siberian,  Sand, 
and  Crag  Martins;  White-rumped,  Alpine,  and  Common 
Swifts  ;  the  Goatsucker  and  Egyptian  Goatsucker,  and 
the  Hoopoe.  This  last  I  saw  in  the  north  of  Semire- 
chia  and  in  the  streets  of  Vierny.  It  is  common  in 
Turkistan,  and  breeds  up  to  an  altitude  of  8,000  feet. 

Other  Turkistan  birds  are  the  Roller,  the  Common 
and  Persian  Bee-eaters,  the  Common  and  Indian  King- 
fisher, of  which  the  latter  seems  to  be  plentiful,  but  the 
former  rare ;  the  Pied  and  Three-toed  Woodpecker, 
the  Wryneck,  and  the 'ubiquitous  Cuckoo,  which  lays 
its  eggs  as  high  as  the  apple  and  ash  groves  of  the 
Lower  Thian  Shan.  To  these  must  be  added  the 
Darjeeling  Wood- Pigeon,  and  the  Stock  and  Rock 
Doves,  with  the  Collared  and  Egyptian  Turtle- Doves, 
also  the  Black-bellied,  Pin-tailed,  and  the  wonderful 
Pallas' s  Sandgrouse,  which  last,  some  twenty  years 
ago,  invaded  Europe  in  such  an  astonishing  way. 

VOL.  I,  27 


4i8  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

We  now  come  to  gallinaceous  or  game  birds,  which 
interest  both  the  sportsman  and  the  gourmand  ;  and  of 
these  are  found  in  Turkistan  the  Black  Grouse  and 
Capercally  or  Capercailzie,  the  Caspian  Snow  Partridge, 
with  the  Chukar,  Grey,  and  Daurian  Partridges  ;  alsa 
the  Quail,  the  Mongolian  Pheasant,  the  Peafowl,  and 
common  Cock.  Next  come  the  common  Siberian 
and  Numidian  Cranes  ;  Black  and  White  Storks  ;  four 
species  of  Herons,  the  Bittern,  Spoonbill,  and  Glossy 
Ibis,  with  Bustards,  of  which  3  species  are  found. 

Wading  birds  again  are  found  in  great  variety,, 
vying  with  the  Finch  family,  in  that  the  species  in 
each  case  number  40,  save  one.  Among  these  are  the 
Dotterel,  the  Lapwing,  Pratincole,  Turnstone,  Avocet,. 
Black-winged  Stilt,  Oyster-Catcher,  3  species  of  Snipe,, 
the  Woodcock,  Ruff,  1 1  species  of  Stint  or  Sandpiper, 
the  Sanderling,  about  10  of  Plovers,  and  the  Stone^ 
Pigmy,  and  Red-billed  Curlew.  This  last  was  thought 
to  be  a  new  species,  and  was  named  by  SevertsofT 
Falcirostra  Kaufmanni,  after  General  Kaufmann,  but 
the  bird  was  known  long  ago  on  the  flat  mountains  of 
Tibet,  and  was  described  and  illustrated  in  1835  by 
Mr.  Gopld,  under  the  name  Ibidorhynchus  StrtUhersi^ 
There  are  four  specimens  in  the  Moscow  Museum,  and 
two  in  the  British  Museum,  there  being  no  difference 
between  the  Thian  Shan  and  the  Tibetan  specimens. 
It  is  found  at  heights  of  not  less  than  5,000  feet,  and 
the  flight  of  the  bird  strongly  resembles  that  of  a 
lapwing.  It  has  red  legs,  and  a  remarkable,  long,  red 
beak,  bent  at  the  end,  well  adapted  for  picking  up 
worms  and  other  live  creatures  from  between  the 
pebbles  and  stones  which  form  the  bed  of  the  mountain 
streams  it  frequents. 

Turkistan  boasts  further  of  4  species  of  Crake,  and 


FROM  AULIE-ATA    TO  TASHKEND,  419 

the  Moorhen,  but  the  latter  is  rare ;  likewise  the  Coot, 
5  species  of  Grebe,  the  Roseate  Pelican,  and  Cormorant, 
and  6  species  of  Gulls.  Six  kinds  of  Tern  breed 
throughout  the  country. 

When  we  come  to  the  Swan,  Goose,  and  Duck 
tribes,  we  have  nearly  30  species,  as,  for  instance,  the 
Wild  original  of  the  Tame  Swan,  the  Whooper, 
and  Bewick's  Swan ;  of  Geese,  the  Larger,  Bean, 
Greylag,  White-fronted,  Swanlike,  Red-breasted,  and 
Painted  Goose  ;  to  which  must  be  added  the  Ruddy 
and  Common  Sheldrake,  the  Mallard,  Gadwal,  Gar- 
ganey.  Teal,  Shoveller,  Wigeon,  Pintail,  Velvet  Scoter, 
Tufted  Duck,  Pochard,  White-eyed,  Golden-eyed,  and 
White-headed  Ducks,  the  Red-breasted  Merganser, 
and  the  Smew. 

Lastly,  the  gaudy  Flamingo  completes  the  list  of 
384  species  that  were  known  to  Severtsoff  in  1873. 
Since  that  date  others  have  been  identified.*  Not 
all  the  species  thus  mentioned  are  settled  birds,  some 
being  migratory,  and  others  birds  of  passage  merely ; 
but  the  mention  of  their  names  will  suffice  to  show 
that  a  very  large  proportion  of  the  Turkistan  birds 
are  found  in  Europe,  though  Severtsoff  indicates 
upwards  of  30  species  in  Asia,  he  regards  as  new. 

The  traveller  who  keeps  to  the  post-road,  I  need 
hardly  say,  will  not  meet  wifh  a  large  variety  of  birds 
or  wild  animals.  Turning,  however,  to  useful  animals, 
as  we  approached  the  hills,  we  saw  several  enclosures 
surrounded  by  high  mud  walls,  admirably  suited  to 
shelter  cattle,  in  which  respect  the  Aulie-Ata  uyezd 
is  the  richest  in  the  province,  the  domestic  animals 
therein  being  valued  at  ;^6o8,ooo.t 

•  For  further  particulars  of  the  ornithological  fauna  of   Turkistan 
see  Appendix, 
t  Kostenko  gives  the   following  statistics  of  domestic   animals  in 


420 


RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA 


The  uyezd  that  comes  next  in  the  value  of  its  cattle 
is  Kazalinsk  (;^ 595,000),  and  the  third  Chimkent 
(;^533,ooo),  into  which  we  entered  at  the  next  station 
after  leaving  Tersk.  Our  road  now  proceeded  west 
for  47  miles  along  the  course  of  the  upper  waters  of 
the  Aris  to  the  station  Yas-Kichu,  through  a  narrow 
valley  that  cuts  off  from  the  Urtak  mountains,  the 
offshoot  of  the  Thian  Shan,  that  forms  the  Kara-Tau. 

The  upper  course  of  the  Aris  terminates  at  the 
station  of  Yas-Kichu,  where  it  emerges  from  the 
mountain  gorge,  and  enters  the  level  steppe.  The 
country  through  which  the  Aris  flows  is  unusually 
fertile,  and  along  the  course  of  the  river  are  raised 
wheat,  jugara,  barley,  .  maize,  and  a  small  kind  of 
millet;  as  also  vegetables,  and  even  cotton,  though 
this  is  the  extreme  limit  of  the  distribution  of  cotton 
in  the  Syr-daria  province.  Natural  meadows  are 
very  numerous  in  the  neighbourhood  of  this  river,  the 
great  fertility  of  the  soil  arising  from  the  fact  that 
it   consists  of  a   black  porous  mud,  well    adapted  for 

Tutkistan,  which  figures  I  have  correctly  copied,  though  in  the  original 
the  totals  are  sometimes  wrongly  added  : —

ploughing  and  retaining  moisture.  The  highest  cul- 
tivation, most  irrigation,  and  largest  corresponding 
amount  of  settled  population  exist  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  Aris,  Badam,  and  certain  of  their  affluents,  and 
grain  raised  in  these  districts  is  exported  to  the  towns 
of  Turkistan  and  Tashkend. 

We  passed  along  the  road  near  the  Aris  during  the 
night,  and  so  well  did  we  travel,  that  between  drinking 
tea  at  Tersk  and  arriving  early  next  morning  at  Chim- 
kent,  we  accomplished  83  miles.  Early  in  the  Russian 
occupation  the  uyezd  of  Chimkent  had.  a  nomad 
population  of  17,493  tents.  This  was  in  1868,  when 
the  city  of  Turkistan  was  included  in  the  uyezd,  and 
when  the  number  of  occupied  houses  in  the  two  towns 
numbered  3,467.  Ten  years  later  it  amounted  to 
7,474,  showing  an  increase  of  4,009  inhabited  houses, 
or  116  per  cent.  ;  a  growth  exceeded,  however,  in  the 
Aulie- Ata  uyezd,  where  363  houses  in  1 868  increased, 
during  ten  years,  to  932,  or  156  per  cent.* 

At  Aulie- Ata  we  heard  that  72  families  of  Men- 
nonites  had  lately  settled  in  the  vicinity,  and  had 
received  a  goodly  portion  of  land. 

The  town  of  Chimkent  has  a  population  of  5,121, 
and  had,  so  long  ago  as  1870,  land  under  cultivation 
amounting  to  71,500  acres  in  670  gardens.     Its  name, 

•  The  houses  in  the  district  of  Khojend  and  Jizakh  increased  63  per 
cent.,  but  in  the  Kurama  uyezd  only  13  per  cent.  This  shows  an 
increase  of  houses  throughout  the  southern  portion  of  the  Syr-daria 
province  amounting  to  nearly  40  per  cent.  The  18,196  new  houses  may 
be  assumed  to  contain  approximately  100,000  souls.  In  the  Zarafshan 
district  the  number  of  houses  increased  from  44,794  to  52,171,  that  is, 
by  about  25  per  cent,  in  five  years,  and  Kostenko  states  that  the  total 
of  the  new  colonists  in  the  province  of  the  Syr-daria  between  1867  and 
1877  may  be  put  down  at  about  300,000  souls.  How  many  of  these  are 
Russians  I  know  not;  but  in  1870  there  were  only  6  Russian  houses 
with  40  inhabitants  throughout  the  uyezd.

according  to  Dr.  Schuyler,  is  derived  from  the  Turki 
chim,  turf,  and  Persian  kenty  town  * 

It  presents  but  little  that  is  remarkable,  except  a 
lofty  citadel,  of  which  I  saw  nothing  as  we  drove 
through  the  town  and  bazaar  in  the  very  early  morning. 
The  post-station  is  provided  with  a  double  number  of 
horses,  and  has  an  extra  importance  by  reason  of  its 
being  at  the  junction  of  the  two  roads  from  Orenburg 
and  Semirechia,  the  distance  from  Petersburg  by 
the  former  being  2,612  miles,  and  by  the  route  I  had 
travelled  4,720  miles. 

We  had  nothing  to  detain  us  at  Chimkent,  and 
therefore  posted  on  10  miles  further  to  Ak-Tash, 
where  we  breakfasted.  Thus  far  from  Aulie-Ata  we 
had  travelled  for  about  50  miles  over  metamorphic 
schists  and  palaeozoic  formations.  I  n  the  valley  of  the 
Aris  the  road  passed  over  granite,  syenite,  and  other 
igneous  rocks,  and  we  had  in  the  mountains,  both  to 
right  and  left,  deposits  of  gold,  iron,  lead,  and  silver, 
as  also  of  mineral  oil  on  our  left  when  leaving 
Chimkent.  We  now  ascended  from  an  altitude  of 
1,650  feet  over  a  number  of  hills,  and  about  noon 
arrived  at  the  station  Bekler-Bek,  700  feet  higher, 
and  remembered  by  me  by  its  old  medresse  or  Muham- 
madan  college,  turned  into  the  Russian  post-house. 
Beyond  this  station  the  road,  continuing  south,  passed 
a  ruined  fortification  on  the  frontier  of  the  Kurama 
uyezd.  Into  this  we  passed,  gradually  descending  to 
the  valley  of  the  Keles,  near  which  river  is  situated 
the  next  station,  Sharapkhan. 

♦  The  terminations  kent  and  kand,  according  to  this  author,  are 
the  same ;  kent  being  used  when  the  vowels  of  the  first  part  of  the

Yarkand,  and,  it  ought  to  be,  as  the  natives  still  call  it,  Tash^^«</,  but 
Tashkend  is  now  generally  accepted. 


FROM  AULIE'ATA   TO  TASHKEND.  423 

So  well  did  our  horses  take  us  on  that  we  accom- 
plished the  next  stage  of  eight  miles  in  three-quarters 
of  an  hour,  and  we  drank  tea  at  Djeri,  where  the 
post-master  evinced  his  thankfulness  for  the  New 
Testament  I  sold  him  by  regaling  us  with  cakes. 
Two  stations  further  we  came  to  Koplan-Bek,  where 
it  became  manifest  that  we  were  approaching  a  large 
town.  We  no  longer  had  open  country  on  either  hand, 
but  the  road  was  confined  by  the  high  mud  walls 
of  gardens  and  summer-houses.  These  gardens  are 
watered  by  canals.* 

And  so  we  approached  Tashkend,  the  head-quarters 
of  the  Russian  administration.  In  size  and  extent, 
it  covers  as  much  ground  as  Paris.  It  is  one  of  the 
largest  towns,  not  only  of  Turkistan,  but  of  the  whole 
of  Central  Asia,  wherein  the  number  of  its  population 
is  said  to  be  equalled  only  by  Bokhara,  and  its  extent 
by  Khokand.  Tashkend  is,  moreover,  an  ancient 
town,  with  a  beginning  lost  in  the  depths  of  time.  It 
is  situated  on  a  high  plateau  we  had  commenced  to 
mount  twenty  miles  from  Chimkent.  On  one  side 
Tashkend  touches  the  Russian  quarter,  but  on  the 
remaining  sides  it  is  surrounded  by  gardens,  through 
which  we  were  passing.  Like  all  large  Central  Asian 
towns,  Tashkend  was  surrounded  by  a  high  castellated 

*  Thirty  miles  south  of  the  city  one  large  canal,  in  appearance  like 
a  river,  has  been  diverted  from  the  Chirchik,  and  passes  at  a  distance 
of  7  miles  north  of  the  town.  Another  canal,  the  Bossu,  leads  from 
the  Chirchik  21  miles  from  the  town,  through  which  its  branches  flow 
under  different  designations.  A  third  canal  has  been  diverted  from  the 
same  source  near  Niaz-Beg,  17  miles  to  the  east,  and  passes  in  a  direct 
line  through  the  Russian  quarter ;  and  having  joined  the  Hadragan 
«anal,  it  branches  off  by  small  channels  for  the  purpose  of  irrigation. 
Besides  the  above-mentioned  canals,  there  flows,  a  mile-and-a-half 
south  of  the  city,  the  small  stream  of  the  Salar,  a  tributary  of  the 
Chirchik.

wall,  and  was  pierced  by  twelve  gates,  called  darwazas. 
The  wall  took  a  circular  form^  and  had  a  circumference 
of  1 3  miles,  the  gates  bearing  the  names  of  the  towns 
in  the  direction  of  which  they  faced.  Now,  towards 
the  Russian  quarter,  the  whole  of  this  wall  has  been 
taken  down  and  the  ground  levelled.  The  gates,  too, 
here  have  been  removed,  though  they  still  remain  in 
the  other  directions. 

Through  one  of  these  gates  we  entered  about  eight 
o'clock  on  the  evening  of  the  1 5th  September,  not  a 
little  pleased  at  being  back  once  more  within  the  region 
of  comparative  civilization,  and  perceiving  Russian 
cabs  and  soldiers  about  the  streets,  though  there  was 
little  enough  of  light  proceeding  from  the  street  oil 
lamps  to  see  them  very  clearly.  We  made  for  what 
had  been  recommended  to  us  as  the  best  hotel,  but 
where  they  had  no  room,  so  that  we  had  to  try  the 
Hotel  **  Nicolaeff,"  a  sorry  place,  yet  we  were  glad  of  a 
rest,  and  still  more  of  a  bath,  after  which  it  was  a  real 
comfort  once  more  to  get  into  beds,  to  which  we  had 
been  strangers  since  leaving  Viemy. 

I  have  now  glanced  at  Russian  Turkistan  in  general,, 
and  more  particularly  at  one  of  its  two  northern 
divisions  —  namely,  the  Syr-daria  province,  within 
the  capital  of  which  we  arrived.  Before  describing  it^ 
I  think  it  better  briefly  to  treat  of  the  Amu-daria 
province,  and  thus  avoid  the  necessity  of  coming 
back  to  Russian  affairs  after  our  boat  is  launched  in 
Bokhariot  and  Khivan  waters.

THE  Amu-adria  oblast  is  bounded  on  the  north 
and  east  by  its  sister  oblast  of  the  Syr-daria, 
on  the  south  by  Bokhara,  and  on  the  west  by  the 
Lower  Oxus  and  part  of  the  Sea  of  Aral.  Oblong  in 
shape,  it  measures  on  the  32nd  meridian  86  miles  by 
318  miles  on  the  43rd  parallel.  It  has  an  area  of 
33,363  square  miles,  or  the  size  of  Portugal,  of  which 
no  less  than  five-sixths  of  the  whole,  or  a  tract  the 
size  of  Bavaria,  forms  the  south-west  portion  of  the 
Kyzyl- Kum  desert.  The  remainder  is  made  up  of 
1,549  square  miles  of  river-bank  country,  and  4,456 
square  miles  of  islands  in  the  Amu  delta.  These 
figures  may  be  regarded  as  the  latest.  I  have  them 
from  a  report  drawn  up  by  command  of  the  Governor- 
General,    a  copy  of  which    was  obligingly   given    me 


426  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

by  the  Governor  of  the  province.  Kostenko  divides  its 
area  into  84'35  waste  land,  15' 12  pastured  by  nomads, 
and  0'53,  or  about  one-half  per  cent,  under  cultivation. 

The  Kyzyl-Kum  Steppe,  that  stretches  from  the 
Oxus  to  the  Jaxartes,  is  not  a  mere  barren  waste  of 
shifting  sands.  It  consists  largely  of  low  hills,  from 
30  to  60  feet  above  the  general  level  of  the  steppe, 
and  covered  with  rangy  a  species  of  sedge.  The 
roots  of  this  plant  form  a  network  to  the  depth  of 
five  or  six  inches,  and  fix  the  sand.  Rang  affords 
excellent  fodder  for  sheep,  but  the  supply  is  too  scanty 
for  larger  animals.  Another  characteristic  feature  of 
the  Kyzyl-Kum  is  the  extensive  growth  of  shrubs 
dotted  over  the  sand,  whilst  nearly  the  whole  of  the 
Amu  delta  is  covered  with  reeds.  The  western  portion 
of  the  Steppe  is  more  covered  with  sands  than  the 
eastern  half,  where  rocky  hills  abound.  South-east  of 
the  Aral  Sea,  and  about  50  miles  from  it,  there  is  a 
strip  of  bare  clay  steppe  about  80  miles  long  and  20 
broad,  on  either  side  of  a  supposed  ancient  water- 
course, and  further  south,  near  another  dry  river  bed, 
there  is  a  smaller  patch  about  25  miles  broad  and  12 
long.  A  salt  marsh  fringes  the  desert  near  the  east 
of  the  delta,  and  extends  partly  into  the  delta  itself, 
whilst  other  portions  are  boggy,  or  partially  cultivated. 

Along  the  centre  of  the  Kyzyl-Kum  runs  the  almost 
unknown  range  of  the  Bukan-Tau.  We  learn  some- 
thing also  of  the  existence  of  hills  running  off  from  the 
Amu,  midway  between  the  apex  of  the  delta  and  the 
Bokhariot  frontier.  In  the  summer  of  1874  Mr.  N.  P. 
Barbot  de  Marny  made  a  geological  exploration  across 
the  Amu  delta,  then  up  the  east  bank  of  the  Oxus  to 
the  Bokhariot  frontier,  and  thence  along  the  caravan 
route  towards   the    Bukan    mountains,   and    so  on   to 


THE  AMU'DARIA    PROVINCE,  ^27 

Samarkand.  From  his  paper  read  before  the  Russian 
•Geographical  Society,  it  appears  that  in  the  centre  of 
the  delta  there  is  an  isolated  hill  about  300  feet  high, 
called  the  Kashkana-Tau,  with  a  flat  top.  Its  western 
slope  is  steep,  forming  two  terraces,  the  upper  consist- 
ing of  greyish-yellow  sand,  containing  concretions  of 
gypsum,  the  lower  of  greyish-green  sandy  loam.  This 
latter  terminates  in  cap-shaped  hillocks,  which  are 
generally  ascribed  to  the  action  of  the  waves  of  an 
ocean  that  travellers  imagine  to  have  existed  here, 
but  De  Marny  says  they  are  due  to  atmospheric 
erosion.* 

After  continuing  his  researches  to  the  Bokhariot 
frontier,  he  gives  as  the  geological  result  that  the 
whole  of  the  country  to  the  north  of  the  Amu  is 
covered  with  limestone,  above  which  rises  the  Sheikh 
Jeili,  a  mountain  mass  35  miles  in  length,  and  con- 
sisting of  crystalline  rocks,  gneiss,  and  granite,  f 

•  The  strata  of  this  hill  dip  slightly  towards  the  north-east.  They 
contain  no  fossils,  and  resemble  mineralogically  the  north-west  shore  of 
Lake  Aral.  Travelling  from  the  apex  of  the  delta  up  the  right  bank  of 
the  Oxus,  clay  is  met  with  close  to  the  river ;  but,  on  leaving  it,  sandhills, 
called  barkhans^  abound,  beneath  which  limestone  strata,  containing 
fossils  of  cretaceous  age,  are  occasionally  exposed.  Continuing  south, 
the  country  rises  gradually,  and  isolated  hills  make  their  appearance, 
of  which  the  Besh-Tau  contains  many  fossils,  including  ammonites. 
One  of  the  two  summits  of  the  Chalpyk  mountain,  from  whence  can  be 
seen  the  Sheikh  Jeili  mountains,  is  capped  by  black  ferruginous  sand- 
stone. In  the  transverse  valleys  of  the  Sheikh  Jeili,  near  the  river, 
gneiss,  and  occasionally  crystalline  limestone,  are  met  with ;  also 
chlorite,  talc,  and  hornblende  schists.  The  schists  frequently  contain 
small  crystals  of  magnesite  and  pyrites,  and  are  traversed  by  veins 
of  quartz.  Copperas  also  occurs  in  small  quantities.  Eastward  from 
the  Sheikh  Jeili  is  the  Sultan- Waiss*Tau,  consisting  of  layers  of  white 
marble.  In  the  eastern  portion  of  the  Sheikh  Jeili  one  of  the  ranges 
consists  of  black  gneiss,  another  of  reddish  marble,  others  of  chlorite 
and  talc  schists.  De  Marny  saw  also  a  large  mass  of  white  rocks  that 
turned  out  to  be  protogine,  containing  almandine-gamets  and  beryls. 

t  It  is  the  result,   he  says,   of  successive  upheavals,   and  existed 


428  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

From  the  Amu  littoral  De  Marny  proceeded 
through  Shurakhane.  Beyond  that  place  the  elevation 
of  the  country  and  the  sand  increase,  the  sand  over- 
lying solid  rocks,  which  form  ridges  running  north 
and  south.  Ferruginous  calcareous  sandstones  are 
occasionally  exposed  on  the  surface.  The  road  leads 
over  ridge  after  ridge  to  the  Kara-Choku  mountain, 
consisting  of  yellow  sand,  capped  with  ferruginous 
sandstone.  At  Myn-Bulak  is  a  spring  of  excellent 
water,  and,  as  one  approaches  it  from  the  west,  the 
Bukan-Tau  rises  in  the  north.* 

From  the  Bukan-Tau  the  road  proceeds  south-east 
to  the  Tamdy-Tau,  and  onward  to  Samarkand.! 

The  hydrography  of  the  Amu-daria  province  is 
confined  to  the  Sea  of  Aral  and  the  River  Oxus,  the 
only  existing  stream  of  importance.  There  are,  how- 
ever, several  dry  beds  of  either  rivers  or  canals,  one 
of  which,  30  miles  long,  runs  south  of  and  parallel  to 

already  when  the  whole  of  the  surrounding  country  was  covered  by  the 
ocean  in  which  the  chalk  was  deposited.  The  lower  valley  of  the  Amu 
and  its  delta  are  covered  with  g-rey  clay,  which  is  most  useful,  both  for 
purposes  of  irrigation  and  for  building,  as  also  is  the  marble  and  other 
kinds  of  building  stone,  but  other  minerals  did  not  appear  in  sufficient 
quantity  to  be  useful.  Report  said  that  gold  and  silver  are  to  be  found 
in  the  Sheikh  Jeili,  and  traces  of  mining  operations  are  to  be  found, 
but  De  Marny  doubts  if  they  ever  were  remunerative. 

•  The  name  Bukan-Tau  is  not  applied  by  the  natives  to  the  whole  of 
these  mountains.  They  have  special  names  for  various  parts  of  them, 
such  as  Tobi-Bergen-Tau,  Yirlir-Tau,  etc.  The  main  direction  of  the 
chain  is  north  and  south,  and,  at  the  spring  of  Kuldur,  is  composed  of 
crj'stalline  limestone,  resting  upon  clay  slate,  and  covered  unconform- 
ably  by  strata  of  conglomerate.  The  barren  summit  of  the  Yirlir  rises 
to  the  east  of  Kuldur,  and  near  is  the  caravan  route  leading  from 
Bokhara  to  Kazalinsk. 

t  The  geological  features  of  the  journey  from  the  Oxus  are — 
(i)  Marine  formation  along  the  whole  of  the  route,  proving,  De  Marny 
thinks,  that  the  Aralo-Caspian  at  one  time  extended  to  the  foot 
of  the  Thian  Shan.  (2)  Many  isolated  mountain  ranges  rising  in 
the  Kyzyl-Kum,  resembling  geologically  the  Sheikh  Jeili.    Their  strato-

the  Sultan- Waiss  range.  There  is  indicated,  too,  upon 
the  best  maps,  the  supposed  channel  by  which  the 
Jaxartes  once  reached  the  bed  of  the  Oxus.  Lake  Aral 
is  supposed  to  take  its  name  from  its  many  islands, 
the  Kirghese  word  ^r^/  meaning  an  island.  It  is 
260  miles  long,  and  in  breadth  from  130  to  180  miles, 
with  an  area  of  1,456  square  miles.  Its  surface  level 
is  48  feet  above  the  ocean,  and  some  130  feet  higher 
than  the  Caspian  (some  say  243),  relatively  to  which 
it  lies  about  200  miles  to  the  eastward.  So  shallow 
is  the  water  on  the  eastern  coast  that  the  Kirghese, 
with  their  cattle,  wade  to  the  island  of  Kut-Djitmes, 
8  miles  from  the  shore.  In  the  centre  the  depth 
attains  to  more  than  90  feet,  and  close  to  the  western 
shore  it  exceeds  220  feet. 

The  prevailing  winds  are  from  the  north-east.  They 
rise  suddenly,  cause  great  disturbance  of  the  water, 
and  leave  behind  a  swell,  against  which  it  is  impossible 
for  a  boat  to  make  headway.  There  usually  reigns 
either  a  dead  calm,  or  a  violent  wind  that  frequently 
increases  to  a  furious  storm.  Of  natural  harbours 
completely   sheltered   from   the   wind   there   are   five 

graphical  relations  are  likewise  similar,  for  their  strike  is  generally 
N.W.,  varying  between  W.  15®  N.  and  W.  45°  N.  It  is  assumed, 
therefore,  that  the  mountains  in  the  Steppe  form  part  of  the  system  of 
upheaval  of  the  Thian  Shan.  (3)  The  sandhills  are  often  said  to  mark 
the  shore  of  an  ancient  ocean  which  at  one  time  covered  the  steppes. 
De  Mamy  found,  however,  that  the  material  of  which  they  consist  may 
be  derived  from  any  geological  formation,  as  long  as  the  sand  is  not 
sheltered  against  the  action  of  the  wind.  (4)  The  salt  swamps  met 
with  in  the  desert  do  not  derive  their  salt  from  recent  marine  deposits, 
which  are  not  met  with  at  all,  but  from  the  efflorescence  of  cretaceous 
strata.  I  ought  to  add  that  several  of  these  conclusions  of  the  Russian 
geologist  are  questioned,  and  some  of  them  apparently  controverted  by 
Major  Herbert  Wood,  who  assisted  in  the  Russian  survey  of  the  Sea  of 
Aral,  and  who  visited  the  Kashkanatao  hill  in  the  delta  of  the  Amu  in 
1876.     S^^  Markham's  Geographical  Magazine ,  January,  1876.

only,   though   the  configuration  of  the  shores  of  the 
sea  forms  numerous  bays,  peninsulas,  and  headlands.* 

The  mouth  of  the  Jaxartes  is  encumbered  with 
sandbanks,  that  are  continually  shifting  the  bed  of 
the  channel.  In  spring  the  ice  accumulates  at  the 
mouth,  and  overspreads  the  sandbanks.  The  water 
rushing  under  the  ice  scoops  out  the  sand  from  under- 
neath, and  forms  a  new  bed,  which  again  silts  up  in 
summer  and  undergoes  fresh  changes.  The  north- 
eastern portion  of  the  sea  is  partially  shut  off  by  the 
island  of  Kug-Aral  t  from  the  so-called  lesser  sea 
(Kichkine-Denghiz),  out  of  which  the  Gulf  of  Sari- 
Chaganak  runs  deep  into  the  mainland,  and  is  thought 
to  have  been  once  a  strait  connecting  the  Aral  Sea 
with  the  Lake  Aksakal-Barda. 

The  southern  part  of  the  Aral  is  not  frozen  every 
year,  and  immense  numbers  of  birds  winter  there.     In 

*  The  northern  shores  are  usually  composed  of  clayey,  salt-impreg- 
nated cliffs,  rising  to  a  height  of  from  loo  to  300  feet.  The  line  of  the 
western  shore  follows  the  edges  of  the  high  tableland  of  Ust-Urt, 
which  is  made  up  of  sandy,  clayey,  and  limestone  layers,  sometimes 
attaining  the  height  of  500  feet.  Throughout  the  whole  of  the  western 
coast  no  suitable  anchorage  can  be  found,  owing  to  its  precipitous 
character  and  the  great  depth  of  the  water.  The  low  southern  shore 
is  composed  either  of  reed-covered  alluvial  deposits  brought  down  by 
the  Amu-daria,  or  of  waves  of  sand.     The  eastern  shore  is  also  low. 

t  The  island  of  Kug-Aral  measures  26  miles  by  7,  and  contains  a 
quantity  of  mica.  Another  island  with  an  area  of  86  square  miles 
is  Barsa-Gilmaz,  which  means,  "You  may  go,  but  not  return,"  in 
memory  of  some  natives  who  once  crossed  on  the  ice  just  before  it 
broke  up.  A  third  island  is  that  of  Tokmak- Ata,  that  derives  its  name 
from  a  saint's  tomb  found  there.  It  has  an  area  of  57  square  miles, 
and,  being  separated  from  the  mainland  by  a  strait  about  2  miles  wide, 
and  only  2  feet  deep,  it  is  approached  by  the  Khivans  either  in  small 
boats  or  by  wading.  Another  island  of  the  Aral  Sea,  and  the  most 
remarkable  of  them  all,  is  that  of  the  Emperor  Nicholas,  with  an 
area  of  133  square  miles.  It  is  almost  covered  with  an  extraordinarily 
thick  growth  of  saxaul  and  tamarisk.  There  are  numerous  saiga  Anti- 
lopes  upon  it.  Hedgehogs  also  have  been  found,  and  the  traces  seen 
of  Foxes.    It  also  contains  Snakes  and  Land  Tortoises. 


THE  AMU-DARIA  PROVINCE,  431 

Other  places  the  Aral  freezes  near  the  shores,  and  the 
ice  is  sufficiently  strong  to  bear  camels.  An  interesting 
point  connected  with  the  Aral  is  that  its  waters  are 
perceptibly  drying  up,  and  its  circumference  diminish- 
ing. The  natives  account  for  the  disappearance  of 
the  water  that  flows  into  the  lake  by  saying  that  in 
the  middle  there  is  a  terrible  whirlpool,  and  that  the 
waters  of  the  Aral  pass  into  the  Caspian  by  an  under- 
ground channel.  The  real  cause,  M.  Maiefif  points 
out,  is  the  physical  law  that,  if  rivers  flow  into  any 
water,  the  body  of  the  latter  continues  to  fill  up  and 
extend  in  area  until  its  surface  is  such  that  the  quantity 
of  water  yearly  evaporated  equals  the  quantity  brought 
down  by  the  rivers.* 

This  drying  up,  however,  is  little  enough  in  com- 
parison with  the  decrease  that  would  take  place  should 
the  Oxus  again  from  any  cause  flow  into  the  Caspian. 
In  this  case,  the  Aral,  deprived  annustUy  of  more  than 
a  million  millions  (i,i75,cxx),ooo,cxx))  of  cubic  feet  of 
river  water,  would  lose  the  first  year  the  twentieth  part 
of  its  contents.  In  10  or  12  years  R6clus  reckons  it 
would  have  no  more  than  half  its  present  volume,  all 

*  The  most  patent  illustration  of  the  lessening  of  the  waters  of  the 
Aral  is  seen  in  the  site  of  the  Gulf  of  Aibughir,  which  still  figures  on 
many  maps  west  of  the  mouths  of  the  Oxus.  In  1848,  according  to 
R6clus,  it  measured  3  feet  deep.  In  1858-9  the  Emperor's  mission 
sailed  on  it  in  boats.  In  1870  it  had  become  a  marsh,  completely 
separated  from  the  Aral,  and  two  years  later  the  Russian  geographers 
in  the  Khivan  expedition  undeniably  established  the  fact  that  the  salt 
Gulf  of  Aibughir  had  disappeared,  and  that  trees  were  growing  in  the 
former  bed.  If  now  it  is  sometimes  covered  with  water  it  is  no  longer 
as  part  of  the  Aral,  but  from  inundations  of  the  Oxus,  and  with  fresh 
water.  This  represents  a  lessening  of  the  basin  of  the  Aral,  according 
to  R^clus,  of  about  2,000  square  miles.  At  the  beginning  of  the  present 
century,  the  water  washed  the  base  of  hills  that  are  now  more  than  40 
miles  from  the  edge,  and  the  Kirghese,  according  to  Wood,  show  a 
mosque,  built  originally  upon  the  eastern  bank,  that  now  is  several 
miles  off. 


432  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

its  flat  bottoms — that  is  to  say,  the  most  extended  parts 
of  its  basin — would  be  dried  up  ;  in  80  years  there  would 
be  water  in  only  five  cavities,  of  which  the  two  prin- 
cipal would  be  found  to  be  one  in  the  centre  and  the 
other  on  the  western  portions  of  the  present  lake,  and 
the  divers  remains  of  the  Aral  Sea  would  be  reduced 
to  the  dimensions  of  other  denghiz  or  Steppe  lakes.* 

The  shores  of  the  Aral  are  desert,  and  during 
summer,  with  the  exception  of  certain  parts  in  the 
south-west,  are  quite  uninhabited  ;  but  in  winter  Kir- 
ghese  nomads  are  met  with  along  the  northern  and 
eastern  shores  and  their  off"-lying  islands.  There  are 
yet  other  points  of  interest  connected  with  the  hydro- 
graphy of  the  Amu-daria  oblast,  such  as  the  descrip- 
tion of  its  great  river  and  the  history  of  the  Aral,  to 
which  I  shall  allude  hereafter. 

Very  detailed  meteorological  observations  have  been 
made  at  two  points  in  the  province — namely,  at  Forts 
Petro-Alexandrovsk  and  Nukus.t  At  the  latter  place, 
during  the  year  preceding  my  visit,  the  temperature  in 
summer  had  gone  up  to  10274,  and  had  sunk  in 
winter  to  —  io'66.  Notwithstanding  these  extremes, 
the  climate  was  reported  to  me  to  be  salubrious,  though 

•  Kostenko,  however,  thinks  that  the  amount  of  the  reduction  of  the 
Aral  in  modem  times  cannot  be  definitely  ascertained,  though  he  points 
out  that  future  investigators  will  be  able  to  compute  to  what  extent  the 
level  may  become  changed,  from  the  fact  that  in  1874  MM.  Mukhof  and 
Solimani  showed  that  the  level  of  the  Aral  lay  at  a  height  of  243  feet 
above  that  of  the  Caspian. 

t  The  following  are  the  mean  annual  readings  of  the  thermometer 
and  barometer  for  1875-6  : —

Dr.  Schuyler  seems  to  imply  the  contrary.  At  Petro- 
Alexandrovsk,  at  the  time  of  my  visit,  there  were 
4,750  soldiers,  and  the  year  had  commenced  with  47 
patients  in  hospital.  Up  to  the  1 5th  of  October  only 
three  fresh  patients  had  been  admitted,  and  though 
none  had  been  dismissed  as  cured,  neither,  on  the  other 
hand,  had  any  died.*  I  learned  from  the  Governor's 
wife  that  children's  diseases,  such  as  croup  and  hoop- 
ing-cough, as  also  scarlatina,  were  unknown,  though 
some  of  the  young  die  of  stomach  diseases.  Again, 
the  natives  of  the  place  are  not  attacked  with  the  Sart 
skin  disease,  though  they  get  small-pox;  and  in  August 
and  September,  when  particles  from  the  cotton  pods 
are  flying  about,  they  contract  ophthalmia,  causing 
eversion  of  the  eyelids,  that  is  painful  and  dangerous. 

The  population  of  the  Amu-daria  oblast  (amounti- 
ing  in  round  numbers  to  150,000  souls)  consists  of 
Karakalpaks,  Uzbegs,  Kirghese,  Turkomans,  Tajiks, 
liberated  Persian  slaves,  colonists  from  the  Ural,  and 
Russian  troops. t  The  Uzbegs  and  Tajiks  are  settled. 
The  Kirghese  are  nomads.  The  Karakalpaks  derive 
their  name  from  the  black  kerchiefs  some  of  them  wear.  J 

*  Their  diseases  were  as  follows:  Fever,  17;  dysentery  and  diar- 
rhoea, 3  ;  inflammation  of  eyes,  lungs,  urinary  and  genital  organs,  and 
intestines,  10 ;  anaemia,  i  ;  heart  disease,  i ;  arterial  disease,  i  ; 
rheumatism,  i ;  scurvy,  2 ;  chronic  eruptions,  i  ;  wounds,  3 ;  venereal 
diseases,  6 ;  diseased  bones,  i  :  and  there  were  on  trial  for  military 
service,  3.

The  province  is  divided  for  administrative  purposes 
into  the  two  divisions  of  Shurakhane  and  Chimbai, 
and  the  principal  populated  points  are  at  Forts  Petro- 
Alexandrovsk  and  N  ulcus ;  Shurakhane,  the  principal 
native  town  ;  Chimbai,  in  the  delta ;  and  Sheikh-Abas- 
Ali.  From  the  statistics  published  in  1880  by  Kostenko, 
it  appeared  that  the  13,286  dwellings  of  the  settlers, 
and  8,156  tents  of  the  nomads,  had  130,000  acres  and 
3,700,000  acres  respectively  of  land,  giving  to  each 
house  8i  and  to  each  tent  450  acres.*  The  more  recent 
data  embodied  in  the  report  I  received  show  a  con- 
siderable development  of  agriculture  among  the  natives, 
notwithstanding  very  unfavourable  physical  conditions, 
for  in  the  two  divisions  the  cultivated  land  during  three 
years  increased  in  Chimbai  from  75,000  acres  to  1 20,000 
acres,  and  in  Shurakhane  from  45,430  to  50,840  acres. 

the  Zarafshan  province  and  the  Kurama  district.  Up  to  the  middle  of 
last  century  Karakalpaks  inhabited  the  lower  course  of  the  Jaxartes,, 
but  they  were  driven  thence  by  the  Kalmuks  to  their  present  places  of 
abode.  The  ruin  that  befel  them  was  so  complete,  Kostenko  says,  that 
they  could  not  recover  themselves  until  they  came  under  Russian 
influence.  In  appearance  they  are  somewhat  stout,  and  are  distin- 
guished for  industry  and  the  peaceful  pursuits  of  agriculture  and  cattle 
breeding.  On  the  Lower  Amu  the  Karakalpaks  have  been  joined  by  20 
different  tribes,  who  till  the  soil  on  the  communal  principle.

THE  AMU'DARTA   PROVINCE,  435 

This  increase  of  cultivation,  and  therefore  of  the 
well-being  of  the  population,  is  traced  to  the  feel- 
ing of  security  inspired  among  the  natives  by  the 
Russian  administration  protecting  them  from  pillage, 
and  distributing  among  them  equality  of  taxation : 
**  such  conditions,"  says  the  report,  **as  always 
accompany  Russian  conquests  in  Central  Asia." 
Another  fact  contributing  to  the  same  end  was  the 
good  harvest  of  1881  in  the  Amu-daria  province, 
whilst  a  lack  of  corn  that  year  in  the  neighbouring 
districts  sent  up  its  price  in  the  local  markets.  It  was 
thus  anticipated  that  the  settled  population  was  well 
supplied  for  a  time,  should  it  be  visited  by  no 
extremely  bad  year.  Indications  of  such  prosperity 
appeared  in  the  absence  of  arrears  for  taxation,  the 
ease  with  which  the  full  liabilities  were  cleared  off, 
and  the  comparative  scarcity  of  coin — the  last  being 
caused,  it  was  supposed,  by  the  hoardings  of  the 
people. 

With  regard  to  the  nomads  of  the  southern  portion 
of  the  province,  their  condition  was  reported  to  be 
slowly  improving.  One  great  disadvantage  under 
which  they  laboured  was  that  they  had  to  remain 
inland  near  wells  far  from  the  river,  and  had  not  easy 
and  safe  access  to  the  pastures  along  the  banks  of  the 
Amu-daria ;  for  although  the  right  bank  was  supposed 
to  be  protected  by  Bokhariot  guards,  yet  in  spring  and 
autumn,  when  the  cattle  need  abundance  of  water  and 
fodder,  the  Turkomans  cross  the  river  and  plunder. 
Accordingly,  the  Governor  recommended  that,  with  a 
view  to  assist  the  Shurakhane  nomads  to  develop  their 
herds,  a  strong  military  post  should  be  stationed  at 
Uch-Uchak  on  the  Bokhariot  frontier,  where  there  are 
large  and  abundant  tugais,  or  spits  of  land  in  the  basin

of  the  river,  to  which  the  wandering  tribes  might 
approach  the  water  for  sheep-shearing. 

The  Amu-daria  oblast  was  annexed  by  the  Russians 
in  1873,  and  was  at  first  divided  into  the  Amu-daria 
and  the  Kyzyl- Kum  districts,  the  latter  comprising  the 
country  in  the  south  of  the  oblast  about  Myn-Bulak 
and  Tamda.  The  administration,  military  and  civil, 
was  committed  to  Colonel  (now  General)  Ivanoff, 
assisted  by  an  official  for  special  commissions,  a  director 
of  the  offices,  a  secretary,  and  a  field-officer,  the  last- 
named  being  entrusted  with  matters  relating  to  military 
administration.  This  division  of  territory  and  con- 
stitution of  the  staff  was  found  afterwards  to  require 
some  readjustment  to  the  present  divisions  of  country, 
and  when  I  was  at  Petro-Alexandrovsk  I  found  Colonel 
Ivanoff,  whom  I  had  met  at  Tashkend,  replaced  by 
General  von  Grotenhielm. 

Dr.  Schuyler  intimates  that,  when  the  territory  was 
annexed,  it  was  thought  that  a  revenue  might  be 
obtained  from  the  province  of  ;^2o,ooo  a  year ;  but, 
according  to  the  report  in  my  hands,  the  first  year's 
taxation  (1874)  yielded  only  ;^  12,385.* 

*  A  two-fold  tax  was  imposed,  a  kibitka  tax  and  a  land  tax,  20,948 
dwellings  being  liable  to  the  former  kind  of  taxation,  and  to  the  latter 
6,736  houses  in  the  Shurakhane  division,  possessing  45,430  acres  of 
land.  Besides  this,  cultivated  land  in  Shurakhane,  the  whole  of  which 
is  in  small  holdings  of  less  than  50  acres,  is  taxed  on  the  same  scale  as 
land  of  a  similar  class  throughout  Turkistan — namely,  is,  qd.  per  acre. 
This  latter  tax  yielded  for  the  province  about  £3,6yy  a  year ;  but,  by 
reason  of  readjustments  in  1877  (when  an  Imperial  tax  was  substituted 
for  the  land  tax],  was  expected  to  yield  in  1882  about  ;f  400  more.  The 
number  of  kibitkas,  too,  at  this  subsequent  revision,  was  found  to  be 
increased  by  670. 

Besides  die  Imperial  taxes  just  mentioned,  local  liabilities  in  money 
and  in  kind,  for  the  maintenance  of  native  administration,  are  met  by 
the  Amu-daria  population,  as  in  other  parts  of  Turkistan,  by  a  Zemsky 
tax,  or  rate  of  2^.  6</.  per  kibitka,  from  the  nomads,  and  a  proportionate 
amount  from  the  settlers.    The  yearly  figure  for  this  rate  amounts  to 


THE  AMU-DARIA   PROVINCE.  437 

Having  taken  advantage  of  this  latest  information 
afforded  me  to  enter  somewhat  fully  into  the  economic 
condition  of  the  Amu-daria  oblast,  and  the  more  so 
since  no  previous  English  author  has  described  it  in 
detail,  and  having  now  treated  of  all  the  ground  behind 
me,  I  proceed  to  describe  what  I  did  and  saw  in  Tash-

and  kandy  town,  is  a  dual  city,  of  which  the 
two  parts  are  so  distinct  and  so  unlike  that  a  visitor 
may  sometimes  walk  a  considerable  distance  without 
meeting  a  Russian  in  one  or  a  native  in  the  other, 
European  Tashkend  is  but  of  yesterday — Asiatic  Tash- 
kend of  more  than  a  thousand  summers,  the  Arabs 
having  conquered  it  so  early  as  a.d.  738.  Asiatic 
Tashkend  is,  for  administrative  purposes,  divided  into 
ioMX  yurtas.  Formerly  these  were  under  the  govern- 
ment of  certain  officials  called  min-bashis,  the  yurtas 
being  known  as  Shah-i-Khan-Tur,  Sibzor,  Kukchi, 
and  Bish-agach.* 

♦  The  first  comprises  the  north-east  part  of  the  town,  where,  situated 
on  a  level  spot,  the  yurta  is  divided  almost  in  two  by  a  deep  ravine,  at 
the  bottom  of  which  flows  the  wide  and  swift  canal  of  the  Ankhor. 
This  Shah-i-Khan-Tur  yurta  consists  of  48  mahalas,  or  wards,  some 


TASHKEND,  439 

The  population  of  Asiatic  Tashkend,  for  the  more 
part,  is  grouped  according  to  trades,  and  the  number 

of  them  having  been  suburban  settlements,  afterwards  incorporated  on 
the  enlargement  of  the  town.  Some  of  these  settlements  were  very 
large,  and  as  all  the  inhabitants  of  a  mahala  have  to  be  invited  when  any 
family  rejoicing  is  going  on,  the  calculating  Sarts  have,  in  certain 
cases,  subdivided  them.  The  population  of  the  Shah-i-Khan  yurta^ 
according  to  Kostenko,  numbers  10,194  souls,  who  occupy  3,030 
tenements,  and  have  in  their  midst  3  medresses  or  colleges,  and  60 
mosques,  with  10  schools  attached  for  230  pupils.  The  principal 
industries  of  this  yurta  are  cast-iron  foundries,  saddleries,  oil-presses 
and  looms,  the  number  of  trades  in  1870  being  reckoned  at  567.  The 
local  looms  for  mata,  or  cotton  cloth,  used  for  shirts  and  drawers,  were 
established  by  Divan  Burkh,  who  was  the  first  to  engage  in  this 
industry,  and  from  hence  they  were  distributed  far  and  wide.  Apart 
from  the  land  occupied  by  buildings,  this  yurta  has  the  least  surface 
devoted  to  gardens,  namely,  300  acres,  but  there  are  860  acres  under 
pasturage,  and  900  acres  devoted  to  rice  cultivation. 

The  Sibzor  yurta  occupies  the  north-west  comer  of  the  town,  and  is 
divided  into  38  wards.  It  has  also  four  settlements,  one  of  which, 
Ibrahim-Ata,  is  noted  for  agriculture,  and  the  raising  oi  jenushkt, 
or  hicem  {Medicagrf  satwa).  The  2,230  houses  in  this  ^2/r/^  contain 
a  population  of  18,650  souls,  and  on  the  banks  of  the  principal  canal, 
the  Kei-kaus  (so  named  after  a  former  ruler  of  Tashkend),  are  centred 
all  the  grinding  mills  of  Sibzor.  The  chief  industry  of  this  quarter  is 
confined  to  the  boot  trade,  Sibzor  boots  being  exported  to  other 
Turkistan  towns.  Weaving  and  dyeing  of  cotton  goods  come  next 
in  importance.  These  two  industries  have  long  been  practised  by  the 
inhabitants,  amongst  whom  the  richest  class  are  the  wholesale  mer- 
chants. Three  medresses,  one  of  which  is  the  famous  Beklar-Bek, 
containing  260  students,  comprise  almost  the  whole  of  the  educated 
portion  of  this  yurta.  There  are,  however,  several  niakhtabs,  or 
schools,  attached  to  some  of  the  private  houses,  and  also  10  principal 
mosques. 

The  Kukchi,  or  western  yurta,  with  its  31  wards,  2,511  houses,  and 
22,088  souls,  is  situated  on  undulating  ground  cut  by  deep  ravines. 
Its  principal  industries  are  connected  with  leather,  there  being  in  1871, 
out  of  695  craftsmen,  341  workers  in  hides,  and  218  bootmakers. 
There  are  besides  6  brick-kilns,  7  potteries,  22  mills,  and  22  oil-presses; 
also  2  medresses,  34  schools,  51  mosques,  and  18  tombs,  of  which  last 
one  is  noteworthy,  namely,  that  of  Sheikh  Zenejin  Baba,  an  exile  from 
Bagdad,  who  was  buried  about  400  years  ago. 

The  fourth,  or  Bish-agach  ^«r/a,  occupying  the  southern  comer  of 
the  town,  has  32  wards,  1,400  houses,  and  12,450  inhabitants,  many  of 
whom  are  proprietors  of  good  gardens  and  fields.     This  is  one  of  the

of  buildings  is  about  1 7, 500,  the  population,  according 
to  the  census  of  1868,  being  76,000.* 

European  or  Russian  Tashkend  is  divided  from 
Asiatic  Tashkend  by  the  Bossu  canal,  and,  though 
founded  only  so  recently  as  1865,  has  developed  rapidly. 
The  streets  are  wide  and  regular,  lined  with  narrow 
canals  and  stately  poplars.  Most  of  the  houses  are  of 
one  floor,  of  sun-dried  brick,  roofed,  in  some  cases, 
with  iron,  and  painted  green  or  red.  Each  house  has 
its  garden,  that  attached  to  the  palace  of  the  General- 
Governor  being  thrown  open  to  the  public  on  certain 
days,  when  a  military  band  performs.  There  is  also  a 
public  garden  that  was  laid  out  by  the  natives.  The 
canals  do  good  service  for  watering  the  streets,  thereby 
rendering  the  quarter  less  dusty,  and  the  temperature 
also  is  lower  than  in  the  native  town. 

There  are  several  good  shops  in  the  Russian  quarter, 
where  European  articles  can  be  procured  at  nearly 
the  double  of  European   prices,  and,  considering  the 

causes  of  the  limited  population,  for  the  landowners,  in  order  to  look 
more  closely  after  their  fields,  often  remove  to  live  near  them.  Thus 
the  village  of  Zengata  became  established  about  180  years  ago,  when  the 
Bish-agach  people  began  to  remove  there  from  the  town.  This  village 
is  so  called  because  in  it  is  situated  the  tomb  of  the  much-respected 
Zengi^Ata,  and  to  it  vast  crowds  of  people  flock  yearly,  when  the 
fruit  is  beginning  to  ripen,  from  various  towns  in  Turkistan.  The 
principal  industry  of  Bish-agach  is  brick-making,  with  which  it  would 
appear  they  have  erected  3  medresses,  16  private  schools,  and  6& 
mosques. 

*  The  buildings  were  as  follows : — Private  houses  occupied,  13,260 ; 
empty,  or  reserved  for  guests,  ^22  ;  Serais  (containing  519  shops)  23  ; 
medresses,  8;  baths,  8;  mosques,  255;  com  mills,  116;  other  mills, 
42  ;  shops  in  the  great  bazaar  (i)  occupied  by  traders,  2,324 ;  (2) 
empty,  307  ;  (3)  booths,  594 ;  (4)  booths  empty,  96 ;  and  shops  occupied 
by  Sarts  in  the  Russian  quarter  of  the  town,  69 — in  all  17,424. 

The  population  was  as  follows : — Sarts,  74,848 ;  Tatars,  610 ; 
Kirghese,  261  ;  Persian,  i  ;  Afghans,  25  ;  Russians,  38;  Jews,  213  ; 
Hindus,  93;  Chinese,  3 ;  the  whole  consisting  of  41,377  males  and 
34,715  females,  in  16,775  families.

distance  and  difficulty  of  transit,  this  is  not  perhaps 

exorbitant.  Russian  Tashkend  boasts,  too,  of  an  ob* 
servatory,  about  a  mile  out  of  the  town,  a  Central  Asian 
museum,  and  public  library,  all  of  which  I  visited. 
There  is  likewise  a  theatre,  and  last,  though  in  its  pre- 
tensions by  no  means  least,  an  officers*  club.  In  1875 
the  inhabitants  of  Russian  Tashkend,  exclusive  of 
troops,  numbered  2,982  males  and  1,870  females,  their 
religious  beliefs  predominating  in  the  following  order : 
Orthodox,  Muhammadans,  Jews,  Romanists,  and 
Lutherans.  Of  the  total  of  4,852  persons,  classified 
under  about  100  trades,  there  are  532  women  who  have 
fixed  occupations  ;  but  1,691  persons  exist  without  a 
definite  calling  ;  and  it  is  worthy  of  note  that  the  popu- 
lation, classified  according  to  ages,  is  found  to  consist, 
for  the  most  part,  of  people  in  full  vigour  from  the  ages 
of  20  to  40.* 

My  hotel,  so  called,  was  situated  in  the  Russian  part 
of  Tashkend,  where,  having  arrived  on  Friday  night, 
my  first  care  next  morning  was  to  visit  the  Governor-^ 

*  According  to  religious  beliefs  the  population  stands  as  follows': — 
Orthodox,  3,473  ;  Muhammadans,  938 ;  Jews,  159 ;  Romanists,  155 ; 
Lutherans,  1 15 ;  Hindus,  4  ;  Evangelists,  4 ;  Armeno-Gregorians,  2  ; 
Reformed,  i ;  and  Anglican,  i. 

According  to  occupations,  as  follows : — Ecclesiastics,  10 ;  military  and 
civil-service  employes,  1,138 ;  medical  officers,  23  ;  traders  and  hotel  and 
restaurant  proprietors,  150 ;  owners  of  factories,  3  ;  clerks  and  shop

General.  General  Chernaieff,  recently  appointed  to  the 
office,  had  not  yet  arrived  from  Petersburg,  but  was 
represented  meanwhile  by  General  A.  K.  Abramoff, 
Governor  of  the  province  of  Ferghana.  The  chief 
administration  of  Turkistan  being  centred  in  Tashkend, 
the  vice-regal  palace,  as  might  be  supposed,  is  the 
finest  house  in  the  town.  It  is  surrounded  by  gardens, 
with  fountains  and  pavilions,  used  for  fetes,  agricultural 
exhibitions,  etc.,  in  summer,  whilst  the  lai^e  saloon 
serves  in  winter  for  social  and  philanthropic  gather- 
ings, such  as  meetings  of  the  Red  Cross  and  other 
societies.  General  Abramoff,  however,  at  the  time  of 
my  visit  was  staying  in  the  Governor-General'^s  summer 
villa,  in  the  outskirts  of  the  town — a  charming  residence 
buried  amongst  trees,  that,  in  Turkistan,  would  be  con- 
sidered fine.  Thither  we  drove,  and  were  ushered  into 
the  study  of  the  General,  who  impressed  me  favourably 
by  his  unassuming  dignity  and  apparent  thoroughness. 
Having  presented  the  letter  I  received  from  General 
Chernaieff  at  Petersburg,  my  first  care  was  to  arrange 
for  the  distribution  of  such  Scriptures  as  I  had  for  the 

sellers,  8 ;  tailors,  55  ;  bootmakers,  ^'j  ;  painters,  1 1  ;  plasterers,  2 ; 
turner,  i  ;  maker  of  French  flooring,  i ;  wheelwrights  and  coach  builders, 
5  ;  market  gardeners  and  florists,  16 ;  bakers,  ^j ;  embroiderers  in  gold 
and  silver,  3 ;  watchmakers,  3  ;  fishermen,  5  ;  music-sellers  (principally 
Jews),  1 1  ;  hawkers  of  bread  and  cakes,  6 ;  bath  proprietors,  5  ; 
armourers,  3  ;  bricklayers,  18 ;  hatters  and  hosiers,  2  ;  upholsterer,  i  ; 
butchers,  3  ;  goldsmiths,  4  ;  tiler,  i ;  sawyers,  3  ;  translators,  5 ;  glazier, 
I  ;  keepers  of  licensed  houses  (all  Mussulmans,  the  women  in- 
cluded), 18  ;  prostitutes,  66  (including  those  married  and  living  in  the 
licensed  houses,  with  husbands,  brothers,  fathers,  children,  etc.) ;  ser- 
vants (including  officers'  orderlies),  314  ;  coachmen,  ^2  ;  female  cooks, 
[II ;  male  cooks,  41 ;  grooms,  16;  nurses,  71 ;  parlour-maids, 25  ;  dress- 
makers, 31,  and  laundresses,  61. 

According  to  ages  as  follows  : — Less  than  10  years  of  age,  880 ;  from 
10  to  15,  230;  from  15  to  20,  461  ;  from  20  to  30,  1,588  ;  from  30  to 
40,  1,156 ;  from  40  to  50,  396 ;  from  50  to  60,  100 ;  from  60  to  70,  24; 
and  more  than  70,  17.

prisons,  hospitals,  and  public  institutions  throughout 
Turkistan.  I  inquired  how  many  would  be  needed  for 
Ferghana,  and  was  at  once  struck  with  the  minute 
acquaintance  his  Excellency  appeared  to  possess  con- 
cerning his  own  province.  **  In  the  prison  at  Khokand," 
said  he,  **  there  are  6  rooms;  in  Marghellan,  16;  in 
Namangan,  8 ;  Andijan,  4,  and  Osh,  3  ;  whilst  the 
rooms  in  the  hospitals  are,  Marghellan,  20  ;  Khokand, 
10;  Andijan,  6;  Namangan,  5;  and  Osh,  5  ;  or  you 
may  send  100  in  all,  in  about  equal  proportions  of 
Russian  and  Tatar."  These  his  Excellency  undertook 
to  distribute  as  I  wished,  so  that  there  should  be  at  all 
times  some  portion  of  Holy  Scripture  within  reach  of 
•every  prisoner  and  patient  in  Ferghana,  and  he  kindly 
undertook  also  to  see  the  same  arrangement  carried  out 
for  the  Syr-daria  province.*  By  a  fortunate  coinci- 
•dence  it  happened  that  General  Ivanoff,  Governor  of  the 
Zarafshan  district,  was  staying  at  Tashkend,  and  pay- 
ing a  visit  to  the  Governor-General  at  the  same  moment 
as  myself.  He  therefore  heard  my  request  to  General 
Abramoff,  and  gladly  accepted  a  similar  offer  of  books 
for  his  own  province.  There  were  15  rooms  in  the 
prisons,  and  25  in  the  hospitals,  he  said,  of  Samarkand, 

4  in  the  prisons  and  6  in  the  hospitals  of  Katte-Kurgan, 
and  2  each  in  the  prison  and  hospital  of  Penjakend. 
'*  About  40  books,"  he  added,  **  might  be  sent  in  Russian, 

5  in  Tatar,  10  in  Persian,  and  2  or  3  in  Hebrew." 
Thus  at  a  stroke  I  had  arranged  for  all  the  prisons  and 
hospitals  of  Turkistan,  except  the  mere  handful  that 
would  be  required  for  the  province  of  the  Amu-daria. 

*  I  subsequently  learned  that  in  the  Syr-daria  oblast  the  prisons  and 
hospitals  were  situated  at  Aulie-ata,  Chimkent,  Tashkend,  Khojend, 
Ura-Tiube,  Jizakh,  Turkistan,  Perovsk,  and  Kazalinsk ;  and  that  I 
might  reckon  on  an  average  four  rooms  to  each,  except  Tashkend,  and 
that  had  fifty. 


444  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

My  next  business  was  to  inquire  respecting  my 
journey  onwards.  I  wished  to  go  to  Khokand, 
Samarkand,  and  Bokhara,  from  whence,  I  asked,  could 
I  go  by  Charjui  to  Merv,  or  could  I  float  down  the 
Oxus  to  Petro-Alexandrovsk,  and  thence  to  Khiva, 
and  across  the  desert  to  the  Caspian  ?  The  General 
seemed  to  think  that  I  ought  to  see  more  of  Ferghana 
than  the  town  of  Khokand,  against  which,  however, 
I  pleaded  lack  of  time,  but  he  said  that  they  could 
not  protect  me  from  Charjui  to  Merv,  and  that  it 
would  be  impossible  or  far  too  dangerous  a  thing  for 
me  to  attempt  to  travel  there  from  the  eastern  side, 
whatever  might  be  the  possibilities  of  getting  there 
from  the  west.  As  for  passing  through  Bokhara,  and 
floating  down  the  Oxus,  this  he  thought  might  be 
done,  though  with  difficulty,  perhaps,  as  to  the  taran- 
tass;  and  with  regard  to  crossing  the  Aralo-Caspian 
desert  they  could  best  advise  me  as  to  the  safety 
or  otherwise  of  attempting  that  when  I  reached 
Petro-Alexandrovsk.  There  lived  General  Groten- 
hielm,  to  whom  a  letter  should  be  given  me,  as  also 
to  the  Emir  of  Bokhara,  and  the  authorities  at 
Khokand.  Nothing,  therefore,  could  have  been  more 
satisfactory ;  and  all  this  kindness  was  capped  by 
General  Ivanoff",  who  invited  me,  during  my  sojourn 
in  Samarkand,  to  stay  in  his  palace. 

A  third  officer  in  the  room  was  Colonel  Mailievsky^ 
the  Vice-Governor  of  the  town  of  Tashkend,  with  whom 
I  made  arrangements  to  be  taken  on  the  morrow  to  the 
local  prison  and  hospitals,  and  then  drove  back  to  the 
hotel,  with  a  mind  considerably  relieved.  Not  only  had 
I  now  virtually  accomplished  the  major  part  of  my  desire 
respecting  the  distribution  of  the  Scriptures,  but  I 
began  to  see  the  feasibility  of  entering  Khokand  and 


TASHKEND,  445 

Bokhara,  upon  which  no  Englishman  living  had  set 
eyes,  and  on  the  realization  of  which  by  myself  my 
friends  had  been  so  sceptical.  I  had  feared,  too, 
from  various  reports  on  my  way,  that  I  might  have 
to  return  by  the  less  interesting  Orenburg  route,  where 
the  postal  service  had  broken  down ;  or  still  worse, 
I  might  be  obliged  to  retrace  the  way  that  I  came. 

As  it  was  Saturday,  I  thought  that  I  could  not  do 
better  than  spend  the  afternoon  in  a  visit  to  the 
Central  Asian  Jews.  I  had  been  favoured  by  Sir 
Whittaker  Ellis,  Bart,  (who,  at  the  time  of  my  leaving 
London,  was  Lord  Mayor,  and  Chairman  of  the 
Committee  for  raising  funds  on  behalf  of  the  perse- 
cuted Russian  Jews),  with  a  letter,  stating  that  I  was 
travelling  with  a  philanthropic  object  in  connection 
with  hospitals  and  prisons,  and  commending  me  to 
the  courtesy  and  attention  of  any  who  might  be  able 
to  assist  me.  This  had  been  translated  for  me  very 
kindly  by  Dr.  Herman  Adler,  the  delegate  chief  rabbi 
in  London,  into  rabbinic  Hebrew,  and,  in  addition,  I 
had  had  the  document  translated  into  Russian,  Persian, 
Arabic,  and  Turki.  When,  therefore,  we  were  taken 
to  the  synagogue  in  the  Russian  quarter,  I  presented 
this  letter  as  an  introduction,  and  asked  whether  they 
had  any  ancient  manuscripts;  but  so  far  were  they 
from  having  things  antique  that  everything  appeared 
almost  new.  I  had  rarely  before  entered  a  synagogue 
so  clean  and  bright.  The  walls  had  been  newly  white- 
washed and  ornamented  with  native  painting ;  and 
though  there  was  no  service  going  on,  there  were 
several  men  and  boys  reading.  They  manifested  the 
utmost  interest  in  my  letter,  but  had  nothing  of  great 
ecclesiastical  interest  to  show,  whereupon  I  discovered 
that  we  had  been  brought  to  the  new  synagogue  of 


446  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

the  European  Russian  Jews,  most  of  whom  had  come 
to  Turkistan  as  soldiers,  and,  on  their  discharge,  had 
preferred  to  settle  in  Tashkend  rather  than  go  back 
to  Russia. 

We  drove,  therefore,  to  the  native  town  to  seek  the 
meeting-place  of  the  Asiatic  Jews,  and  after  going  as 
far  as  the  isvostchik,  or  cabman,  could  take  us  by  reason 
of  the  narrowness  and  miserable  paving  of  the  streets,, 
we  took  to  our  feet,  and  passing  through  narrow  lanes 
and  alleys,  came  into  a  small  yard,  on  one  side  of 
which  was  a  miserable  shed  with  a  lean-to  roof  of 
poles,  wretchedly  covered,  whilst  under  and  all  around 
sat  a  crowd  of  people  assembled  for  prayer  and  reading. 
On  the  Friday  evening  the  Jews  assemble  in  the 
synagogue,  which  is  compared  to  a  bridegroom,  to  wel- 
come the  coming  in  of  the  Sabbath,  that  is  beautifully 
personified  in  one  of  their  prayers  as  a  bride,  whilst 
on  Saturday  evening  they  gather  to  bid  the  Sabbath 
farewell.  Whether,  on  the  present  occasion,  it  was 
this  stated  Sabbath  evening  service,  or  something  of 
a  less  formal  character,  I  am  not  sure  ;  but  so  surprised 
did  they  appear  at  our  sudden  visit,  and,  above  all, 
so  curious  to  get  a  peep  at  my  letter,  that,  the  service 
being  speedily  concluded,  all  crowded  around.  From 
hence  we  were  led  to  an  adjacent  part  of  the  bazaar 
to  another  assembly,  where,  within  still  narrower  limits, 
under  a  straw  roof,  a  number  of  grave  and  reverend 
elders  were  sitting  on  the  ground  and  praying,  or 
reading  and  intoning.  This  struck  me  as  a  remarkable 
sight,  by  reason  of  the  magnificent  faces  of  some  of 
the  old  men.  With  their  huge  turbans,  of  spotless 
white,  and  Oriental  flowing  robes,  they  reminded  me 
of  the  typical  Israelites,  depicted  by  Holman  Hunt 
in  his  picture  of  finding  Christ  in  the  Temple,  and

Other  works.*  The  miserable  accommodation  of  the 
Tashkend  Jews,  even  for  Divine  worship,  brought 
vividly  to  one's  mind  to  how  low  a  condition  this  people 
are  sunk  in  some  parts  of  their  dispersion.  They 
read  my  letter,  and  received  my  visit  evidently  with

ornamented  with  silver  and  precious  stones,  and  also 


permitted  me  to  look  into  the  cupboard  containing 
their  books.  These  last  did  not  appear  very  plentiful, 
and  as  I  had  brought  some  Hebrew  Old  Testaments 
with  me,    I  offered  to  sell  them  at  reasonable  prices 

•  The  Jews  of  Central  Asia,  like  the  Sarts,  shave  their  heads,  except 
that  they  leave  a  lock  falling  in  a  curl  from  each  temple.  This  patch 
of  hair  is  left  uncut,  in  obedience  to  Lev.  liit.  27,  xxi.  5—"  Neither 
shalt  thou  mar  the  comers  of  thy  beard,"  which,  by  transference  from 
the  beard  to  the  hair,  is  fairly  intelligible  ;  though  it  is  not  so  patent 
how  they  evade  the  other  command—"  They  shall  not  make  baldness 
upon  their  head,"  for  this  appears  to  be  the  very  thing  these  Jews  do.

if  they  would  come  to  the  hotel.  Their  Torahy  or 
manuscript  of  the  law,  had  been  written  and  mounted 
in  Bokhara,  but  was  not  remarkable.  Their  having 
no  synagogue,  together  with  the  poverty  and  ill- 
furnished  condition  of  their  hired  place  of  prayer,  was 
explained  to  a  large  extent  by  the  fact  that  almost 
all  the  Jews  in  Tashkend  are  traders  and  sojourners 
only,  as  also  by  the  oppression  to  which,  before  the 
Russian  occupation,  they  were  subject  under  the  Khans 
of  Khokand.  We  called  later  on  the  leading  Jew 
of  the  town,  named  Abdurrhamanoff,  said  to  be  a 
very  rich  man,  who  was  living  in  a  fine  native  house, 
built  and  ornamented  in  the  style  of  the  Sarts.  He 
had  travelled  a  good  deal,  but  not  so  far  as  England. 

On  Sunday  we  found  that  there  was  no  Protestant 
service  in  the  town,  and  I  was  called  upon  in  the 
course  of  the  day,  and  asked  to  conduct  one  for  the 
Germans ;  but  as  my  linguistic  powers  were  not  equal 
to  this,  and  they  understood  no  English,  I  was  power- 
less. I  heard  of  one  countrywoman  settled  in  the 
town,  but  was  not  so  fortunate  as  to  find  her  at  home. 
After  the  Russian  morning  service  the  NacJtalnik 
gorod,  or  head  of  the  town,  took  me  to  visit  first  the 
prison,  which  I  shall  describe  hereafter,  and  then  to  the 
military  hospital,  where  we  were  received  by  Colonel 
Serpitzky  and  Dr.  Proskouriakoff.  In  both  places 
I  distributed  something  for  the  inmates  to  read,  and 
found  my  pamphlets  readily  accepted.  Whilst  driving 
through  the  principal  open  place,  we  stopped  for  a 
few  minutes  at  the  grave  of  General  von  Kaufmann, 
who  is  buried  in  the  middle  of  the  town.  A  few 
wreaths  remained  on  the  mound,  but  no  permanent 
monument  was  as  yet  erected. 

The  hospital  is  in  the  suburbs,  near  the  Salar  Canal, 


TA  SHKEND,  449 

on  ground  850  yards  long  by  550  at  its  widest  part. 
The  high  road  passes  through  it,  and  on  the  west  are 
the  houses  of  some  of  the  staff.  The  ground  east  of 
the  road  is  allotted  about  equally  between  the  winter 
and  summer  buildings,  and  is  thickly  planted  with 
poplars.  The  institution  ranks  as  a  Russian  hospital 
of  the  second  class,  for  15  officers,  380  soldiers,  and 
20  women,  with  300  beds  in  readiness  and  100  in 
reserve.*  The  houses  in  the  winter  quarters  are  all  of 
burnt  brick,  with  iron  roofs,  each  having  a  bath  and  a 
retiring  place.  One  house  has  a  surgical  room,  and 
the  amount  of  air  in  the  six  is  a  total  of  3,877  cubic 
feet.f 

On  the  17th  September,  the  day  of  my  visit,  there 
were  in  the  hospital  14  officers,  260  soldiers,  and  31 
women,J  305  in  all,  out  of  which  number  35  were 
prisoners.  On  the  corresponding  day  of  the  previous 
year  there  were  in  hospital  358  patients.  The  most 
common  diseases  in  Tashkend  are  fever  and  diarrhoea. 
This  is  explained  by  the  climate,  which  favours  the 
development  of  fevers  and  their  results — catarrhal  in- 

*  The  winter  quarters  comprise  wards  for  (i)  venereal  diseases,  (2) 
diarrhoea,  (3)  skin  diseases,  (4)  fevers,  (5)  prisoners,  (6)  oflBcers  and 
female  patients.  The  summer  quarters  consist  of  16  barracks,  each 
for  20  patients,  and  tents  of  three  sizes  for  14,  4,  and  2  patients 
respectively. 

t  The  hospital  has  a  church,  a  dispensary,  dead-house,  lodgings  for 
the  staff  and  for  two  sisters  of  charity,  two  kitchens,  a  bakehouse,  office, 
bath,  and  cellars  ;  besides  store-rooms  and  an  anatomical  theatre,  with 
mortuary  chapel.  The  hospital  staff  consists  of  a  head  doctor,  with  6 
clinical  assistants.  The  administration  is  in  the  hands  of  an  overseer, 
a  commissaire,  and  a  book-keeper,  whilst  to  look  after  the  patients 
there  are  105  soldier  servants. 

\  Their  ailments  were  as  follows  :  Fevers,  16  ;  typhus,  20;  diarrhoea, 
106  ;  ophthalmia,  9  ;  diseases  of  the  chest,  20,  and  kidneys,  4  ;  syphilis, 
15  ;  venereal  diseases,  25  ;  bruises,  wounds,  and  fractures,  15  ;  ab-

diseases,  10;  insanity,  10;  undecided,  8;  women's  diseases,  5.

flammation  of  the  intestinal  canal.     Next  may  be  men- 
tioned a  peculiar  skin  disease,  called  by  the  natives 
Pascha-charda     {Lupus),     besides     some    other    skin 
diseases,  the  nature  of  which  had  not  been  fully  de- 
termined; and  thirdly  ophthalmia,  induced  by  the  glare 
of  the  sun  and  the  dust.     Tertian  ague  also  prevails. 
Notwithstanding  the  unfavourable  climatic  conditions, 
however,  the  result  of  the  treatment  has  been  con- 
sidered satisfactory,   the   death-rate    for   the  previous 
four  years  having  been  5,   7,  7f,  and  4J  per  cent,  re- 
spectively.*    The  daily  cost  of  a  patient  with   food, 
medicine,   lighting,   heating,   and   repairs  of  buildings, 
etc.,   is  about  a  shilling  a  day.     In  the  summer  the 
patients  who  need  mountain  air  are  transferred  to  a 
temporary   sanatorium    in    Chimgan,     60   miles    from 
Tashkend.       I    learned    that    autumn    is    the   season 
when  they  have  most  patients,  on  the  arrival  of  the 
young  recruits  from  Russia,  and  when  fruit  is  plentiful 
and   cheap.      The   hospital    is    chiefly    tenanted    by 
Russians,    the    natives    not    having    yet    sufficiently 
overcome   the   dread    of    their    conquerors    to   come 

in  numbers.! 

Colonel  Serpitzky  took  us  from  the  hospital  to  an 
asylum  close  by  for  old  men  and  women,  so  spotlessly

t  The  Russian  authorities  established  a  dispensary  for  the  natives  in 
1874.  It  was  built  at  the  expense  of  the  Asiatic  portion  of  the  town, 
whose  inhabitants  are  therefore  supplied  with  medicine  without  cost. 
Russian  inhabitants  may  receive  medicine  on  payment.  The  natives

clean  and  nice  that  I  was  constrained  to  write  ''almost 
too  goody  The  asylum  had  been  built  largely  through 
the  means,  I  believe,  of  the  Colonel,  and  is  supported 
by  voluntary  contributions  ;  but,  though  they  could 
accommodate  30  inmates,  their  income  allowed  of  only 
7  being  admitted.  I  tasted  the  soup,  and  found  it 
so  good  as  to  lead  me  to  exclaim,  **  Would  that  I  could 
have  obtained  the  like  on  the  road  hither !  '*  This 
falling  short  of  an  original  conception,  as  apparent  in 
the  asylum,  is,  1  am  beginning  to  think,  a  failing  in 
the  Russian  character,  of  which  we  were  reminded  a 
second  time  on  the  same  day,  when  Colonel  Serpitzky 
kindly  introduced  us  to  the  officers'  club,  where  we 
could  comfortably  dine  during  our  stay.  **  Go  to/'  the 
committee  had  said,  money  in  hand,  **  let  us  build  a 
club  that  shall  be  worthy  of  so  important  a  place  as 
Tashkend ! "  and  thereupon  they  had  designed  a 
building  more  pretentious  by  far  than  any  provincial 
military  club  I  have  seen  in  England,  with  lofty  rooms 
for  billiards,  balls,  and  dinners,  with  a  piano  that  cost 
the  trifle  of  ;^200,  and  other  things  in  proportion  ;  till 
this  sage  committee  found  their  money  spent,  their 
club  incomplete,  and  themselves  exposed  to  the 
taunt    that    they    had    begun   to    build,    but  were  not

pensary was  opened  in  the  Russian  town  of  Tashkend.

able  to  finish.  Three  times  a  week  in  the  summer 
there  is  music  in  the  garden,  and  in  winter  there 
are  dancing  parties.  They  provided  us  an  ex- 
cellent dinner — the  best  we  had  eaten  for  many- 
days — and  we  then  returned  to  our  grand  hotel,  to 
find  that  during  our  absence  the  Governor-General  had 
honoured  us  with  a  call.  Later  in  the  evening  two 
German  gentlemen  paid  us  a  visit,  one  of  whom  said 
that  he  had  come  from  Khiva  in  a  tarantass,  but 
under  exceptional  circumstances,  and  we  heard  from 
another  quarter  that  the  road  was  exceedingly  difficult. 
But  before  we  could  think  of  starting  south,  I  had 
many  persons  to  visit,  places  to  see,  and  arrangements 
to  make,  to  the  doing  of  which  we  addressed  ourselves 
on  the  Monday  morning.

I  TOOK  an  early  opportunity  at  Tashkend  of 
looking  into  the  prospects  there  of  the  British 
and  Foreign  Bible  Society.  For  a  long  time  the  eyes 
of  the  Committee  in  Petersburg  had  been  turned  in  the 
direction  of  Central  Asia  before  a  suitable  agent  pre- 
.sented  himself  by  whom  they  could  commence  opera- 
tions. At  length  it  came  to  pass  that  a  body  of 
German  sectaries,  called  Mennonites,  to  avoid  military 
service  in  Russia,  determined  to  proceed  to  one  of  the 
independent  khanates  in  Central  Asia.  Among  them 
was  a  man  who  had  previously  acted  as  a  colporteur, 
and  he  proposed  that  he  should  take  with  him  copies 
of  the  Scriptures,  and  endeavour  to  open  a  dep6t. 
The  Governor-General  had  given  permission  that  the 
dep6t  might  be  opened,  and  I  went  on  the  Monday 


454  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

to  see  the  house  that  had  been  hired.  It  was  well 
situated  in  one  of  the  best  business  streets  of  the  town, 
and  in  the  care  of  Mr.  John  Bartschand  his  brother,  but 
not  yet  properly  fitted.  A  few  books  had  been  sent 
by  the  post,  by  the  route  I  travelled,  at  great  cost  and 
much  damage  to  the  volumes ;  but  a  large  caravan 
consignment  was  expected  by  way  of  Orenburg,  which 
not  having  arrived,  my  hopes  of  replenishing  my  stock 
of  Asiatic  Scriptures  were  doomed  to  disappointment. 
This  was  the  more  unfortunate,  because  I  could  not 
send  so  many  copies  as  I  wished  in  Asiatic  languages 
for  the  hospitals  and  prisons,  though  I  left  directions 
at  the  dep6t  that  they  should  be  supplied  ;  nor  could 
I  increase  my  scanty  store  for  distribution  amongst  the 
Muhammadans.  I  was  able  to  get  150  additional 
Russian  Scriptures,  for  which  I  left  27  copies  of 
Hebrew,  Sclavonic,  and  German  to  render  more 
complete  the  stock  of  the  depot,  and  then  I  made  up 
at  the  hotel  three  parcels  of  Scriptures  and  other 
publications  for  the  prisons  and  hospitals.*  From  the 
acting  Governor-General  I  received  a  very  appreciative 
note,  written  thus:  **  With  special  acknowledgment  I 
accept  the  books  you  have  sent,  and  will  order  them 
to  be  distributed  and  made  use  of  according  to  your 
wish.  The  report  concerning  their  distribution  I  shall 
have  the  honour  of  sending  you  to  London.  Allow  me 
to  thank  you  with  my  whole  heart  for  your  truly 
Christian  work  on  behalf  of  the  moral  enlightenment 
of  the  poor  and  unfortunate  in  our  district.'* 

•  They  were  sent  as  follows : — To  General  Abramoff,  for  Ferghana, 
51  Scriptures  and  160  tracts;  to  General  IvanofF,  for  the  Zarafshan 
district,  47  Scriptures  and  120  tracts ;  and  to  Colonel  Mailefsky,  for  the 
Syr-daria  province,  67  Scriptures  and  400  tracts  ;  together  with,  in  each 
case,  6  copies  of  the  illustrated  Russian  Workman^  and  3  of  the 
**  Prodigal  Son.*'

We  took  an  early  opportunity  to  call,  at  the  school 
of  silkworm  culture,  on  M.  Oshanin,  to  whom  I  had 
more  than  one  introduction,  and  whose  name  I  had 
frequently  heard  mentioned  on  my  way  in  connection 
with  scientific  pursuits.  He  gave  us  a  hearty  welcome, 
and  afforded  me  much  information.  He  had  been  a 
pupil  of  Professor  Bogdanoff,  of  Moscow,  and  entomo- 
logy was  his  strong  point ;  his  speciality  being  the 
study  of  what  are  vulgarly  called  '*  bugs,*'  but  in  scien- 
tific parlance  hemiptera,  or  one  of  that  order  of  insects 
that  feed  on  animal  or  vegetable  juices  by  means  of  a 
sucking-tube.  Of  these  he  had  a  very  fine  collection, 
exceedingly  well  arranged,  and  such  was  his  love  of 
the  study,  that  he  had  learned  English  chiefly  for  the 
sake  of  mastering  the  treasures  of  its  entomological 
literature.  He  was  able  to  give  me  sundry  hints  as  to 
where  I  might  find  information  respecting  the  natural 
history  of  Turkistan,  and  it  was  from  his  lips,  curiously 
enough,  at  Tashkend,  that  I  first  heard  of  a  well-known 
naturalist,  Mr.  Robert  MacLachlan,  F.R.S.,  living  in 
the  next  parish  to  my  own  in  England.  M.  Oshanin 
secured  for  me  a  valuable  book  I  have  not  yet  seen 
in  England  on  the  fauna  and  flora  of  the  Kyzyl-Kum 
desert  and  the  Khivan  oasis.  He  had  to  tell  also 
of  an  interesting  expedition  he  had  made  four  years 
previously  beyond   the  Russian  border  in  Karategin. 

M.  Oshanin  is  curator  of  the  Tashkend  museum, 
through  which  we  walked  and  noticed  a  number  of 
interesting  ethnographical  specimens,  as  well  as  a  few 
antiquities.  There  was,  for  instance,  a  good  collection  of 
enamelled  tiles  and  bricks  from  Kuldja  and  Samarkand, 
and  a  vase  with  a  pedestal  found  in  the  mountains  near 
Aulie-Ata,  so  near  the  ancient  episcopal  Almata,  that 
it  was  thought  it  might  be  a  baptismal  font.    There  was 


456  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

also   a   bronze    bell,    found    in  the    neighbourhood  of 
Tashkend,  6  inches  high,  with  a  diameter  of  4  inches 
at  the  base,  with  metal  J  of  an  inch  thick,  but  the 
clapper  is  wanting.     We  saw  also  ancient  coins,  and 
some  Greek  fire  bombs  of  earthenware,  with  grooves 
on  the  convex  side.*     To  the  foregoing  may  be  added 
sundry  Buddhist  idols,  in  metal,  and  one  in  trachyte. 
There  were,  likewise,  certain  botanical  specimens;  as 
the   sponge  plant,   having  a  fruit  resembling   sponge 
inside,  that  is  used  by  the  natives ;  and  cktgt,  a  textile 
plant   cultivated   at    Kuldja.      M.    Oshanin    not  only 
showed  us  all  that  he  thought  might  be  interesting,  but 
kindly  gave  me  a  small  collection  of  Turkistan  seeds, 
chiefly  cereals,  and  two  live  torjtoises,   which  it   was 
supposed  I  might  be  able  to  get  safely  to  England. 

There  was  another  gentleman  to  whom  I  had  an 
introduction,  and  whose  acquaintance  I  was  thankful  to 
make,  who  has  done  so  much,  both  by  his  travels  and 
his  pen,  to  make  the  country  known.  I  mean  Colonel 
Nicolai  Alexandrovitch  Maieff,  the  well-known  editor 
of  the  Turkistan  Gazette.  I  could  have  had  no  better 
authority  than  he  for  information  and  statistics  concern- 
ing Central  Asia,  and  I  was  gratified  by  his  telling  me 
that  the  Governor-General,  who  seemed  to  expect  that 
I  should  make  a  longer  stay  than  I  did,  had  asked 
Colonel  Maieff  to  be  of  use  to  me,  which  he  was  abun- 
dantly ready  to  be,  both  in  making  excursions,  and  in 
providing  me  with  a  number  of  Russian  books  not 
easily  accessible,  and  in  some  cases  not  existing,  in 
England.  He  also  gave  me  several  photographs,  and 
put  me  in  the  way  of  getting  others,  many  of  them  by 
amateurs,  which  have  helped  to  adorn  my  writings.

I  had  introductions  to  nearly  a  score  of  persons  in 
Tashkend,  and  so  need  hardly  say  that  our  time  was 
fully  occupied.  Early  on  Tuesday  morning  Colonel 
Poukoloff  came  to  invite  us  to  dine  on  the  day  follow- 
ing at  the  palace  of  the  Governor-General,  and  he 
then  conducted  us  to  the  Asiatic  part  of  the  town.  We 
took  a  droshky  for  this  purpose,  our  conductor  remark- 
ing that  he  could  not  take  his  own  carriage  into  the 
native  town  by  reasoi>  of  the  roughness  of  the  roads. 


and  their  consequent  damage  to  any  but  the  strongest 
of  carri^e-springs.  Before  us  rode  a  djiguitt  and  two 
aksakals,  or  native  elders,  with  a  rich  Sart,  said  to  be 
a  friend  of  the  Colonel's,  as  interpreter,  and  these  signs 
of  importance  going  before,  and  our  conductor  being 
known  as  the  head  of  the  town,  we  had  a  good  oppor- 
tunity of  witnessing  the  respect  that  is  paid  by  Orientals 
to  one  high  in  office.  When  the  crowds  caught  sight 
of  us  they  not  only  respectfully  made  way  and  stood 
on    either   side    of    the    street,    but    those    who    were

sitting  arose,  and  such  as  knew  the  Colonel  personally 
stroked  their  beards.  Men  on  horseback  dismounted, 
stood,  and  bowed,  and  laughing  children  running  about 
suddenly  pulled  up  at  the  roadside  in  perfect  order 
until  we  had  passed.  It  was,  in  fact,  just  as  if  I  had 
suddenly  sprung  back  to  a  stage  of  civilization  por- 
trayed in  the  Book  of  Job.* 

The  only  building  we  saw  in  Old  Tashkend  that  I 
deemed  worth  making  a  single  note  about  was  the 
Medresse  Beklar  Bek,  built  of  brick,  now  having  only 
about  50  students,  but  from  the  top  of  which  we  gained 
a  view  of  the  uninteresting  Asiatic  town.  The  low, 
flat  housetops  of  earth,  the  want  of  regular  lines  of 
streets,  and  the  absence  of  colour  about  the  houses, 
made  the  city  one  of  the  most  dismal  I  had  ever 
looked  down  upon.  Few  of  the  buildings  had  an 
upper  story,  the  dull  monotony  of  the  plain  of  roofs 
being  relieved  only  by  bald  mosques  and  minarets,  or, 
sometimes  better,  by  trees.  We  continued  our  way 
through  very  narrow,  ugly  streets  to  the  old  bazaar, 
composed  of  rows  of  dirty-looking  shops,  there  being 
frequently  stretched  overhead  a  loose  roofing  of  dried 
branches,  that  had  doubtless  a  few  weeks  back  done 
service  in  keeping  off  the  rays  of  the  summer  sun. 

The  new  native  bazaar  in  Russian  Tashkend  is 
cleaner,  and  better  stocked,  and  therein  we  had  pro- 
cured abundance  of  excellent  fruit ;  but  we  were  now 
in  search  of  antiques  and  native  curiosities.  We  saw 
displayed  Bokhariot  and  Kashgar  carpets  or  rugs,  the 
former  about  £^  each,  the  latter  half  that  price.  A 
very  handsome  Sart  tent,  lined  with  native  silk  through- 

*  Job  xxix.  7,  8  :  "When  I  went  out  to  the  gate  through  the  city, 
when  I  prepared  my  seat  in  the  street !  The  young  men  saw  me,  and  hid 
themselves :  and  the  aged  arose,  and  stood  up.  The  princes  refrained 
talking,  and  laid  their  hand  on  their  m(»uth.**

out,  that  would  have  looked  exceedingly  well  on  an 
English  lawn,  was  offered  us  for  ^12.  It  was,  of 
course,  too  bulky  for  me  to  carry,  or  at  least  I  thought 
so,  and  I  had  to  confine  myself  to  the  purchase  of 
smaller  things.  Prominent  among  these  was  a  chambary 
or  pair  of  chocolate  leather  pantaloons,  gorgeously 
embroidered  in  all  the  colours  of  the  rainbow.  At  the 
bottom  they  are  big  enough  for  a  lady's  waist,  and 
none  but  a  Falstaff  could  ever  hope  to  fill  them  at  the 
top,  so  that  when  first  offered  to  me,  who  am  of  pro- 
portions **  Slender,"  I  laughed  outright.  "  I  was  bidden, 
however,  not  to  despise  them,  for  that  when  I  came  to 
horseback  travelling  I  might  find  them  both  warm  and 
at  the  same  time  useful,  when  tied  at  the  bottoms,  for 
stowing  away  one's  linen  or  other  goods  as  in  veritable 
**bags."  I  was  glad  to  get  some  native  pockets*  and 
purses,  together  with  the  leather  suspender  to  which 
they  are  tied,  and  hung  from  the  girdle,  something 
after  the  fashion  of  a  lady's  chatelaine,  and  of  which 
they  are  so  much  a  part  that  the  whole  girdle  and 
things  suspended  therefrom  are  called  by  one  name, 
kaltaj\  We  purchased  pocket  handkerchiefs  and  skeins 
of  native  silk,  the  latter  very  glossy,  and  dyed  and  sold 
largely  by  the  Jews,  who  from  the  numbers  we  saw  in 
the  bazaar,  and  their  begrimed  appearance,  gave  one 
the  idea  that  they  engage  a  good  deal  in  handicrafts, 
especially  dyeing.  There  were  on  sale,  too,  tibeteikas, 
or  skull  caps,  constantly  worn  by  the  Muhammadans, 
even  in-doors.  Some  of  these  caps  from  Shahr-i-sebz 
in  Bokhara  show  great  taste  and  skill  in  needlework. 

•  One  of  these,  now  in  the  British  Museum,  is  of  black  glazed  leather, 
stitched  with  green  and  white  thread;  with  two  pockets,  and  flap  fasten- 
ing, the  thongs  being  of  rough  white  leather. 

t  Similarly  we  read,  **  Provide  neither  gold,  nor  silver,  nor  brass,  in 
your  purses  '* ;  th  ras  (atvast  literally,  in  your  girdles  (Matt.  x.  9). 


46o  RUSSIA N^  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

A  specimen  Central  Asian  padlock  I  secured  is  of  iron, 
with  a  cylindrical  body,  the  key  being  formed  of  a  tube 
with  a  female  screw,  which,  fitting  on  a  screw  in  the 
lock,  on  being  turned,  withdraws  the  bolt  from  the  hasp. 
Fairly  good  Russian  knives  were  plentiful,  but  the 
native  scissors,  with  blades  angular  in  section,  were  so 
clumsily  made  as  to  be  worth  buying  for  a  curiosity. 
Embroidered  slippers,  such  as  I  had  seen  in  the 
Caucasus,    were    offered    for   sale,    but    were    not    so 


remarkable  as  some  thin  muslin  handkerchiefs  or 
shawls,  embroidered  in  flossy  silk,  with  the  peculiarity 
that  the  work  is  alike  on  both  sides.  This  constantly 
attracts  the  attention  and  puzzles  the  skill  of  my  lady 
friends,  who  say  they  could  not  do  the  like.  It  reminds 
one  of  Sisera's  "  prey  of  divers  colours  of  needlework 
on  both  sides,  meet  for  the  necks  of  them  that  take  the 
spoil "  (Judges  v.  30).  A  typical  object  I  bought  for 
the  British  Museum   was  a  Central  Asian  chilim,  or 


TASHKEKD.  461 

water-pipe.  The  body  is  formed  of  a  gourd  mounted 
in  engraved  brass,  filled  in  with  red  and  black,  and 
set  with  imitation  turquoises.  The  stems  are  of  reed, 
engraved  and  blackened,  and  the  bowl  of  pale  red 
ware  painted  in  cream  colour  on  a  brown  or  red 
ground,  with  green  borders,  brilliantly  glazed.  But 
the  purchases  in  Tashkend  I  treasure  most  are  an 
embroidered  cushion  cover  of  soft  leather,  and  a  very 
handsomely  embroidered  table-cloth,  in  which  the 
colours  are  boldly  but  beautifully  blended,  never  failing 
to  call  forth  the  admiration  of  those  who  see  them. 

Thus  far  I  have  spoken  of  curiosities  and  fancy 
articles.  Domestic  expenses  in  Tashkend  may  be  judged 
from  the  following  mention  of  prices.  House  rent 
is  dearer  than  at  Petersburg,  and  as  costly,  I  should 
think  (judging  from  one  house  and  grounds  quoted 
to  me  at  ;^8o  per  annum),  as  in  provincial  towns  in 
England.  Domestic  servants  on  board  wages  receive 
from  12^.  to  18^.  per  month,  a  nurse  16^.,  and  laundress 
from  16^.  to  20^.  Russian  men-servants  expect  30^.  a 
month  and  upwards,  but  natives  from  i6j'.  to  iSi". 
White  bread  costs  \\d,  a  lb.  ;  cooking  butter  Srf.,  and 
fresh  butter  3^.  a  lb.  ;  a  sucking-pig  from  2S,  to  4^.  ;  the 
best  beef  and  veal,  \\d,  a  lb.  ;  a  turkey  from  125-.  to 
14J.  ;  a  chicken  8rf.  to  15.  ;  and  pheasants  \od.  each. 

With  regard  to  the  import  and  export  trade  of 
Tashkend,  some  faint  idea  may  be  formed  of  its 
extent  from  the  fact  that  in  1876  goods  arrived  at  the 
town  from  Russia,  Bokhara,  Semipolatinsk,  and  various 
parts  of  Turkistan  and  Semirechia,  on  23,669  camels, 
804  carts,  and  1,355  horses.  Over  against  this  there 
were  sent  away  goods  on  2,323  camels,  about  half  of 
which  went  to  Russia,  and  a  fourth  each  to  Khokand 
and  Asiatic  Tashkend. 


462 


RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 


There  is  a  spring  and  an  autumn  fair  at  the  capital.* 
Leaving  now  the  trade  of  Tashkend  in  parti- 
cular, and  passing  to  the  trade  of  Russian  Central 
Asia  in  general,  I  may  observe  that  the  first  authority 
upon  this  subject  is  M.  Petrovsky,  whom  I  met  in 
Petersburg,  and  who  in  1873  published  a  report  on 
the  trade  statistics  of  Turkistan,  since  which  date  I  am 
not  aware  that  anything  so  complete  has  been  issued,  t 
M.  Petrovsky,  in  his  table  of  exports  leaving 
Turkistan  at  four  points  of  exit — namely,  Tashkend, 
Aulie-Ata,  Kazala,  and  Khojend  in  1872,  enumerates 
about  fourscore  articles  of  merchandise,  of  the  total 
value  of  ;^648,392,+  whilst  in  his  corresponding  table 

♦  The  administration  of  the  fair  in  1879  cost  ;^i,i03  ^*or  office  rent 
and  salaries  of  secretaries,  treasurer,  storekeeper,  etc.,  besides  £(yQ  for 
keeping  clean  and  watering  the  bazaar  square  and  streets,  and  ;^8o 
for  supplying  the  bazaar  square  with  water.  This  fair  was  established 
by  the  Russians.  Dr.  Schuyler,  who  was  in  Tashkend  in  1873,  judged 
it  anything  but  a  success.  Whether  it  is  likely  to  become  so  I  know 
not,  but  it  would  appear  that  in  1877  the  value  of  the  goods,  cattle, 
fruit,  and  com  imported  there  amounted  to  ;^  100,323. 

t  This  report,  I  have  no  doubt,  was  in  the  hands  of  Dr.  Schuyler, 
and  probably  helped  him  in  his  treatment  of  the  subject,  which  is  so 
masterly  and  full  that  I  shall  deem  it  sufficient  to  give  the  outlines  of 
Turkistan  imports  and  exports  from  M.  Petrovsky,  adding  thereto  such 
information  as  I  have  received  of  a  more  recent  date.

RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 


St.  Petersburg  Gazette^  is  right,  when  it  sees  much  to 
deplore  iti  the  present  condition  of  the  Russo-Asiatic 
trade.  All  the  expectations  of  a  large  and  profitable 
trade  with  Central  Asia,  which  were  raised,  it  says,  by 
the  conquest  of  Turkistan,  have  been  doomed  to  dis- 
appointment, and  it  has  been  found  that  Russians 
cannot  compete  with  the  English,  whose  goods,  it  is 
affirmed,  fill  the  caravansaries  of  Bokhara,  Ferghana, 
and  Samarkand.  In  a  report  published  by  the  Russian 
finance  ministry,  it  is  shown  that  between  the  years 
1 85 1  and  1 88 1  the  balance  of  Central  Asian  trade  has 
turned  to  the  disadvantage  of  Russia.  Thus  the 
exports  from  Russia  to  Central  Asia —

In  the  year  1882,  the  value  of  imports  from  Central

as  well  as  on  her  western  frontier,  Russia  imports  far 
more  than  she  exports,  paying  the  balance  in  gold. 
The  St.  Petersburg  Gazette  expects  to  see  English 
manufactures  penetrating  through  Central  Asia,  unless 
the  Russian  trade  is  better  conducted. 

Among  the  causes  militating  against  the  interests 
of  Russian  trade  in  Central  Asia  are  said  to  be  the 
defective  means  of  communication.  *'  Russian  mer- 
chandise is  despatched  into  the  Steppe  in  the  most 
primitive  fashion,  and  the  firm  sending  the  goods 
sometimes  hears  nothing  of  them  for  a  year.  The 
goods  are  priced  high,  and  the  system  is  chiefly  credit. ' 
The  agents  sent  with  the  caravans  are  said  **  mainly  to 
seek  their  own  profits,  to  defraud  their  employers,  and 
impose  unscrupulously  upon  the  Asiatics,  all  which 
tends  to  involve  the  native  population  in  debt  and  to 
impoverish  it."  How  far  all  this  is  true  I  know  not, 
but  it  is  instructive  to  see  that  the  panacea  proposed 
by  the  Gazette  is  the  formation  of  a  Russian  com- 
pany that  shall  vie  with  English  commercial  houses. 

On  leaving  the  bazaar  in  Asiatic  Tashkend  we 
returned  to  the  Russian  quarter  of  the  town  to  visit 
the  seminary  for  training  schoolmasters,  and  here  we 
met  the  Vice-Governor.  There  were  5  5  pupils,  1 1  of 
whom  were  Kirghese.  The  institution  reminded  me 
of  one  similar  I  visited  in  1879  at  Kasan,  where  youths

from  the  surrounding  native  tribes  were  educated  with- 
out payment,  and  sent  back  to  their  various  nationalities 
as  instructors.  •  Upon  mentioning  that  I  had  visited 
the  place  at  Kasan,  the  director  of  the  Tashkend 
seminary  told  me  that  he  was  trained  there.  The 
course  at  the  seminary  comprises  the  studies  followed 
in  the  first  four  classes  of  the  gymnase,  or  high  school. 
\  was  much  pleased  with  their  singing,  and  noticed  that 
each  member  of  the  choin  singularly  enough,  had  light 
hair.  They  produced  a  powerful  body  of  harmony,  that 
was  heard  to  good  effect  in  the  "  Prayer  of  Alexander 
Nevsky,"  Lvofs  **  National  Anthem,'*  and  in  the  chro- 
matic progressions  of  the  beautiful  **  Cherubim "  by 
Berdniansky.  I  sent  a  few  Scriptures  for  distribution 
in  this  seminary. 

Tashkend  has  a  town  school  of  two  classes,  for 
giving  to  children  of  all  grades  a  secular  and  moral 
education.  The  town  schools,  supported  by  the 
government,  are  of  one,  two,  three,  and  four  classes, 
and  the  full  course  of  teaching  lasts  six  years.  The 
subjects  taught  are  :  Religion  (to  children,  that  is,  of 
the  orthodox  faith) ;  reading  and  writing ;  Russian  and 
Sclavonic  ;  arithmetic  ;  practical  geometry  ;  geography 
and  history  in  general,  and  those  of  Russia  in  par- 
ticular ;  elements  of  natural  history  and  physics  ;  draw- 
ing and  gymnastics.  Trades  also  may  be  learned  out 
of  school  hours,  the  pupils  paying  half  the  expense 
incurred.  Children  are  received  at  the  age  of  7,  of 
all  classes,  conditions,  and  faiths — admission  taking 
place  once  a  year.  The  number  of  children  under 
instruction  in  the  schools  of  Tashkend  is  1,360  males 
and  1,064  females,  or,  including  37  pupils  who  belong 
to  Tashkend,  but  are  being  educated  out  of  Turkistan, 
2,461   children  in  all.     The   rules  for  the  reception  of 


TASHKEND,  467 

children  into  the  Tashkend  Boys'  Pro-Gymnase,  or 
preparatory  school,  provide  that  application  for  admis- 
sion must  be  accompanied  by  certificate  of  age,  of 
rank,  and  a  signed  agreement  that  the  pupil  shall  be 
clothed  according  to  the  prescribed  uniform,  and  be 
provided  with  all  that  is  necessary  for  a  pupil.  Pay- 
ment is  at  the  rate  of  £j^  a  year  for  the  higher,  and 
£2  for  the  lower  classes ;  drawing  being  6^.  extra. 

Our  visit  to  the  seminary  over,  we  drove  to  the 
observatory,  getting  on  the  way  a  good  view  of  the 
broad  streets  of  Russian  Tashkend,  and  in  the  suburbs 
of  some  of  the  substantial  merchants'  houses  with  their 
gardens.  We  received  a  hearty  welcome  from  M. 
Pomerantzoff,  the  director  of  the  astronomical  obser- 
vatory, to  whom  I  presented  my  introduction  from 
Captain  Rykatcheff,  chief  of  the  meteorological  obser- 
vatory in  Petersburg.  He  willingly  showed  us  all  that 
was  of  interest,  and  gave  me  a  record  of  the  local 
temperature  and  precipitation  (or  fall  of  rain,  snow,  sleet, 
and  hail)  of  the  preceding  year.*  In  the  astronomical 
portion  of  the  observatory,  which  ranks  in  Russia  as 
of  second  class,  we  were  shown  a  transit  circle  by 
Repsold,  of  Hamburg,  that  cost  ;!^400,  furnished  with 
an  object  glass,  made  by  Merz,  of  Munich,  for  £^00. 

The  average  yearly  temperature  at  Tashkend  is 
40*10,  equal  to  that  of  Baku,  whilst  for  the  month  of 
February  it  is  about  the  same  as  that  of  Sevastopol.! 

•  See  p.  469. 

t  The  winter  is  not  of  long  duration,  for  the  snow  melts  quickly,  be- 
ginning to  fall  about  the  end  of  December  and  ceasing  at  the  end  of 
January.  The  snow  is  intermingled  with  rain,  which  falls  by  degrees 
from  the  beginning  of  October.  From  the  middle  of  December  there  is 
a  great  deal  of  rain,  and  it  ceases  altogether  in  March.  It  may  some- 
times fall  in  April,  but  in  May  Tashkend  begins  to  experience  drought. 
The  winter  frosts  at  Tashkend  reach— 6** "25,  and  the  summer  heats  go  up 
to  io6'*'25  in  the  shade.    At  Tashkend,  and  places  to  the  south,  spring

After  seeing  the  observatory,  we  went  to  pay  an 
evening  visit  to  the  camp,  where  we  found  Colonel 
Serpitzky  in  command  of  a  battalion  of  a  thousand 
men  of  the  1 2th  Turkistan  infantry.  We  were  shown 
the  canteen  and  barracks.  They  struck  me  as  decidedly 
lacking  in  comfort,  and,  although  the  men  looked  cheer- 
ful enough,  I  could  not  help  suspecting  that  English 
soldiers  would  not  have  been  so  amiable  in  such 
quarters.  The  Si.  Petersburg  Gazette,  alluded  to 
earlier  in  this  chapter,  speaks  of  a  recent  revision  of 
the  Turkistan  province  by  Senator  Giers,  who  found 
that  enormous  sums  of  money  had  been  recklessly 
spent  on  handsome  buildings,  club  houses,  luxuriant 
dwelling-houses  for  military  and  other  officers,  while 
the  troops  have  been  located  in  unhealthy  and  hastily 
as  well  as  cheaply-  and  badly-built  barracks.  This  last 
charge,  judging  from  the  one  barrack  I  visited,  I 
should  be  disposed  to  confirm.  There  were  not  want- 
ing tokens,  however,  that  Colonel  Serpitzky  personally 
took  great  interest  in  the  welfare  of  his  men,  for  whom 
he  evidently  spent  both  time  and  his  private  means. 
Their  leisure  hours  were  thought  of,  and  I  saw  not 
only  reading  material  of  a  secular  character  provided 
for   them,  but  in   a  small  cupboard  was   a  stock   of 

begins  in  March.  In  April  the  trees  are  in  foliage,  and  in  May  the 
grass  is  already  parched.  Apricots  begin  to  ripen  in  Tashkend  at  the 
end  of  May,  peaches  and  the  earlier  kinds  of  grapes  at  the  end  of  June 
or  beginning  of  July.  There  are  no  strong  winds  at  Tashkend.  Those 
blowing  from  the  east  and  north-east,  as  well  as  from  west  and  south- 
west, are  always  warm.  The  former  sometimes  bring  rain,  the  latter 
always.  The  north-west  and  also  the  southerly  winds  are  uniformly 
cold.  As  a  rule,  about  five  earthquakes  in  the  course  of  the  year  are 
felt  at  Tashkend,  but  they  are  usually  so  slight  that  they  are  not  noticed 
by  everybody.  In  1868  occurred  a  shock,  that  lasted  30  seconds,  and 
threw  down  several  old  buildings  in  the  Asiatic  quarter  and  killed  20 
persons.  For  the  observation  of  earthquakes,  the  chemical  laboratory 
at  Tashkend  has  a  mercury  seismometer.

Russian  copies  of  the  Gospels,  one  of  which  I  heard 
was  presented  to  each  soldier  on  the  expiration  of  his 
term  of  service,  to  the  number  of  about  1,000  a  year, 
and  that  about  10,000  copies  had  been  put  into  circu- 
lation by  sale  or  gift.  The  Colonel  had  done  this,  if  I 
mistake  not,  in  connection  with  the  Russian  Bible 
Society.  I  need  hardly  say  that  I  was  glad  to  meet  a 
fellow-volunteer,  as  I  also  was  to  come  upon  the  track  of 
another  at  Vierny,  where  I  found  in  the  prison  some 
New  Testaments,  Gospels,  and  other  works  that  had 
been  provided  by  a  M.  Pantusoff  from  a  Russian 
society  for  the  distribution  of  religious  books.

470  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

The  Tashkend  public  library  we  visited  on  a  subse- 
quent day.  It  was  established  under  the  auspices  of 
von  Kaufmann,  Governor-General  of  Turkistan,  and 
consists  of  5,381  works  in  9,734  volumes,  and  in 
languages  predominating  in  the  following  order  : — 
Russian,  2,695  works;  French,  1,444;  German,  850; 
English,  Latin,  Italian,  Swedish,  Dutch,  etc.,  392. 
The  magnum  opus  of  the  library,  however,  consists  of 
a  collection  of  information  relating  to  Central  Asia 
generally  and  to  the  Turkistan  district  in  particular. 
I  was  told  that  almost  everything  that  had  been 
published  since  1867  on  Central  Asia,  such  as  articles 
in  papers  and  journals,  and  likewise  every  pamphlet 
and  book,  had  here  been  gathered  by  the  biblio- 
grapher Mejoff,  and  placed  in  chronological  order 
in  large  volumes,  now  upwards  of  300  in  number,  in 
uniform  binding — an  excellent  work,  truly,  and  one 
for  which  I,  who  have  searched  the  London  libraries 
through  in  making  a  similar  list,  ought  of  all  men 
to  be  thankful.  And  so  I  am  ;  though  I  doubt  the 
absolute  completeness  of  MejofTs  work,  for  I  have 
found  some  publications  other  than  Russian  in  the 
languages  of  Western  Europe  that  are  not  in  his  list. 
I,  however,  think  that  his  great  work  and  my  own  little 
bibliography  combined  must  approach  very  near  com- 
pleteness, as  regards  books  published  on  Central  Asia. 
There  is  just  one  peculiarity  in  the  work  of  my 
distinguished  co-labourer,  to  which  I  cannot  resist 
playfully  alluding.  I  mean  the  binding  the  books  all 
of  one  size,  which  entails  this  amusing  result,  that 
when  a  book  comes  to  hand  that  is  smaller  than  the 
procrustean  binding,  the  leaves  are  cut  at  the  back 
and  pasted  singly  on  pages  of  blank  paper  cut  through 
to  the  size  of  the  letterpress  ;  which  is  uncomfortable, 


TASHKEND.  471 

but  bearable.  When,  however,  a  book  has  come  to 
hand  larger  than  the  regulation  size,  the  leaves  have 
actually  been  turned  in  to  reduce  the  dimensions ;  the 
consequence  of  which  is  that  the  reader  must  unfold, 
and  in  so  doing  not  improbably  tear,  each  leaf  before 
he  can  read  it  !.  To  these  wonderful  tomes  is  attached 
an  excellent  alphabetically-arranged  index,*  whilst  the 
contents  of  volumes  i — 300  have  been  published  at 
Petersburg. 

On  the  Wednesday  evening  we  had  the  honour  of 
dining  with  General  Abramoff.  Our  host  is  a  bachelor, 
and  there  were  no  ladies  present,  but  several  officers  of 
distinction.  Unfortunately  for  me,  the  General  did  not 
speak  French,  and  though  there  was  no  lack  at  the 
table  of  persons  who  did,  yet  having  to  speak  through 
an  interpreter  to  the  Governor-General  prevented  that 
full  enjoyment  of  intercourse  which  I  feel  sure  I  should 
have  experienced  could  we  have  communicated  our 
ideas  directly  ;  for  what  I  saw  and  all  I  heard  of  him 
led  me  to  form  a  high  estimate  of  his  character  as  a 
governor.  One  of  those  in  office  under  him  told  me 
that  his  subordinates  simply  **  adore  "  him.  It  had 
been  suggested  to  me  that  I  should  ask  for  two  or 
three  Cossacks  to  accompany  us  for  security  when  out 
of  Russian  territory,  but  the  General  said  that  he 
could  not  grant  that,  for  even  embassies,  when  going 

*  The  Tashkend  library  receives  from  the  State  a  yearly  subsidy  of 
;f  130.  Of  this  amount  ;^8o  are  devoted  to  the  maintenance  of  the 
library,  and  £^q  to  purchase  of  books,  periodicals,  and  binding.  During 
1878,  183  men  were  admitted  as  subscribers,  to  whom  were  issued  2,780 
volumes,  or  an  average  number  of  15  or  16  to  each  man.  The  library 
is  well  supplied,  of  course,  with  the  back  numbers  of  the  Turkistan 
Gazette,  This  newspaper  sells  for  2\d,  per  copy,  and  about  500  copies 
of  each  number  are  printed.  It  represents  an  effort  to  introduce  Russian 
civilization  into  Central  Asia,  and  the  Government  gives  it  a  subsidy  of 
;^500  a  year.

to  Bokhara,  did  not  have  them  ;  but  he  would  give  me 
letters,  open  and  otherwise,  that  would  help  me  every^ 
where  on  my  route.  He  said,  moreover,  that  he 
should  hear '  about  us,  and  requested  that,  if  we  got 
into  difficulty,  we  would  send  to  him  at  once.  On 
leaving  the  vice-regal  residence  we  called  at  a  small 
house  in  the  grounds,  where  General  Ivanoff  had  taken 
up  his  quarters,  to  whom  I  am  afraid  I  had  not  paid 
sufficient  attention  in  calling  earlier  at  his  private 
dwelling,  though  I  had  done  so  at  his  offices.  His 
Excellency  was  not  to  return  to  Samarkand  for  some 
time,  but  promised  to  write  to  his  servants  that  we 
should  be  entertained  in  his  palace. 

Our  official  arrangements  being  now  adjusted,  we 
had  to  think  of  personal  affairs,  for  we  were  about 
to  plunge  into  a  region  comparatively  unknown,  and 
be  lost  for  a  while  to  European  civilization.  Even  now 
I  had  received  no  postages  since  we  left  Tiumen — that 
is,  for  six  weeks — though  I  had  had  the  satisfaction  of 
sending  many  cards  and  letters.  -This,  also,  would 
have  now  to  stop,  or  almost  so,  for  a  time.  So  I 
wrote  to  my  friends  that  they  should  not  be  alarmed 
if  they  did  not  hear  from  me  till  I  reached  the  Caspian. 
Also  thinking  to  reduce  my  luggage  as  much  as 
possible,  I  sent  off  to  Odessa,  **by  parcels  post,"  two 
great  boxes  of  curiosities,  unitedly  weighing  loo 
Russian  pounds,  and  at  a  cost  of  £2,  6s,,  and  2^.  more 
for  insurance,  to  which  I  may  add  that  they  arrived  in 
excellent  condition  before  my  advice,  and  scarcely 
scratched,  doing  nothing  worse  than  frighten  my 
consignee,  who  wondered  what  Nihilistic  manoeuvres 
might  be  contained  in  boxes  from  such  an  unexpected 
quarter,  and  spoke  thereon  to  the  authorities. 

Another  thing  requiring  management  was  my  money. 


TASHKEND.  473 

I  had  sent  a  large  proportion  of  it  from  Petersburg 
to  the  bank  in  Tashkend  by  post,  and,  on  calling,  found 
it  there ;  but  since  I  was  now  starting  for  a  region 
where  robbers  abound,  it  seemed  to  me  a  question 
whether  I  had  better  not  take  as  little  as  was  necessary 
with  me,  and  telegraph  for  the  rest  when  I  reached 
some  place  of  safety  ;  and  seeing  that  I  could  not  tell, 
until  I  arrived  at  Petro-Alexandrovsk,  whether  I  should 
cross  the  Aralo-Caspian  desert,  or  go  by  the  Orenburg 
route,  I  promised  to  telegraph  from  Krasnovodsk  or 
the  Syr-daria  whether  the  balance  should  be  sent  to 
Tiflis  or  to  Orenburg. 

It  was  not  quite  easy  to  decide  whether  or  no  to 
take  forward  my  tarantass,  for  some  were  very  confi- 
dent (and  not  without  reason,  as  I  afterwards  learned) 
that  we  should  never  be  able  to  get  the  carriage  from 
Bokhara  to  the  Oxus.  We  were  advised,  however, 
by  Major  BukoC  whom  we  met  at  the  club,  to  get  to 
Khiva  if  possible  on  wheels,  and  I  determined  accord- 
ingly to  attempt  it.  I  had  no  further  use,  however, 
for  the  wagonette,  since  my  Russian  books  were 
nearly  all  disposed  of,  and  those  I  had  remaining  in 
other  languages  could  all  be  packed  in  one  box.  I 
proceeded  accordingly  to  sell  the  wagonette,  and  in 
so  doing  met  with  a  piece  of  unusually  generous  deal- 
ing. Finding  at  Moscow,  in  the  office  of  Kamensky 
Brothers,  carriers  and  transport  agents,  when  I  was 
sending  some  goods,  that  they  had  a  branch  office 
at  Tashkend,  I  had  asked  for  an  introduction,  which 
in  due  course  I  presented,  and  was  asked  by  the 
manager  what  he  could  do  for  me.  Finding  that  I  wished 
to  dispose  of  my  telega,  he  inquired  the  price.  The 
wagonette  had  cost  £y^  at  Tiumen,  where  I  was  told 
that  by  the  time  we  reached  Tashkend   the  vehicle 


474  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

would  be  worth  nearly  double,  either  because  they  do 
not  make  them,  or  do  not  make  them  well,  in  the 
south.  I  was  too  old  a  traveller,  however,  to  expect 
much  gain  of  this  sort,  but  I  remembered  that  the 
Russian  plan  is  for  the  buyer  to  beat  down  the  sales- 
man's price,  and  so  I  began  by  asking  £6,  when,  to 
my  surprise,  without  having  seen  the  vehicle,  my 
customer  said  that  they  did  not  want  it,  but  that  as  I 
had  the  introduction  and  to  oblige  me,  he  would  give 
that  price  if  I  could  sell  it  to  no  one  else.  Of  course,  I 
did  not  think  it  necessary  to  try,  and  on  the  morning 
we  were  to  leave,  the  money  came  by  the  hand  of  a 
messenger,  who  seemed  as  pleased  to  get  the  carriage 
as  I  was  to  have  bargained  in  such  a  pleasant  way, 
and  to  have  received  such  attention  on  the  strength  of 
a  mercantile  introduction.* 

It  only  remained,  then,  to  have  our  tarantass  put  in 
thorough  repair,  and  to  lay  in  our  stores,  and  a  few 
articles  of  warm  clothing  in  prospect  of  cold  in  crossing 
the  desert.  By  the  advice  of  our  hotel-keeper,  we  had 
a  large  sheet  of  felt  nailed  on  the  hood  of  the  tarantass, 
so  that  if  we  met  with  a  sandstorm  we  might  cover  up 
the  front  of  the  carriage ;  and  then  we  were  ready  to 

♦  I  may  here  mention  that  the  pioneer  of  Russian  trade  with  Central 
Asia  was  Ivan  Feodorovitch  Kamensky,  partner  in  the  well-kno^*n  firm 
of  Kamensky  Brothers.  He  at  first  managed  the  Siberian  branch  of 
their  business,  establishing  himself  at  Tomsk.  Thence  he  removed  to 
Kuldja,  where  the  change  of  Imperial  policy  towards  the  Chinese — 
first  their  being  eager  to  assist  and  then  anxious  to  prevent  the  trans- 
port of  supplies — left  him  stranded  and  ruined,  so  that  his  health  broke 
down,  and  a  few  months  after  my  visit,  on  the  24th  December,  at 
Pishpek,  he  died.  Kamensky  was  not  only  an  enterprising  merchant, 
but  a  lover  of  science  and  patron  of  learning.  In  i860,  he  himself 
founded,  at  an  expense  of  ;^4,ooo,  an  agricultural  school  at  Tomsk. 
He  also  assisted  in  several  scientific  expeditions,  and  for  substantial 
aid  furnished  by  him  to  Potanin*s  expedition  to  Mongolia  in  1879,  the 
Russian  Geographical  Society  awarded  him  their  diploma  of  honorary 
corresponding  member.

depart.  We  ate  our  last  dinner  in  Tashkend  at  the 
officers'  club,  where  the  French  manager  told  us  the 
experience  of  an  English  gentleman,  who  many  years 
before  managed  to  push  his  way,  without  permission, 
as  far  as  the  capital,  and  on  the  first  night  after  his 
arrival  accompanied  this  Frenchman  to  a  feast  at  a 
circumcision,  where  von  Kaufmann,  the  Governor- 
General,  was  present,  and  who,  seeing  the  English- 
man, ordered  him  to  leave  Tashkend  within  four-and- 
twenty  hours.  It  was  well  for  me,  I  thought,  that  my 
lot  had  fallen  under  a  more  amiable  authority,  who 
was  willing  that  I  should  go  where  I  pleased,  especially 
in  Ferghana,  towards  which  1  was  now  to  wend  my 
way  from  Tashkend  to  the  Syr-daria  at  Khojend.

TO  the  traveller  leaving  Tashkend,  the  city  is  seen 
to  be  well  situated,  for  though  not  built  upon 
a  river's  bank,  yet  the  snows  of  the  Talasky  Ala-Tau 
and  the  springs  in  the  Chatkal  mountains  send  down 
sufficient  water  in  the  River  Chirchik  to  allow  canals 
diverted  therefrom  to  afford  a  constant  supply.  Also 
Tashkend  is  centrally  situated  in  the  zone  of  the  watered 
region  that  stretches  from  the  country  about  Samarkand 
to  the  valleys  of  Semirechia,  and  there  are  paths  per- 
mitting of  easy  communication  with  the  upper  valleys 
of  the  Syr,  the  Talas,  and  the  Chu.  I  have  frequently 
noticed  in  Russia,  and  even  in  out-of-the-way  places  in 
Siberia,  how  fond  the  people  are  in  summer  of  leaving 
their  town  houses  for  a  cottage  in  **  the  country  ";  and 
this  practice  prevails,  with  good  show  of  reason,  at 
Tashkend,  where  those  who  possess  property  in  the 
suburbs  follow  the  custom  of  the  natives,  and  live  in

tents  in  the  midst  of  their  gardens.  Zengi-Ata,  south 
of  the  capital,  which  the  traveller  passes  on  the  road 
to  Chinaz,   is  a  fashionable  resort  of  this  kind. 

This  road  goes  direct  from  Tashkend  to  Samar- 
kand, a  distance  of  190  miles.  Of  this  route  I  need 
here  speak  only  of  the  journey  to  Jizakh,  since  I 
traversed  the  remainder  coming  from  Khokand.* 

We  set  out    for    Khojend    on    Thursday   evening,

About  5  miles  beyond  Zengi-Ata  is  the  first  station,  Niiazbash ;  the 
second  is  called  by  the  natives  Eski-Tashkend,  or  Old  Tashkend,  a 
pretty  and  rather  picturesque,  but  a  tumble-down  place,  about  half  a 
century  old,  whence  the  mass  of  inhabitants  have  been  driven  to  New 
Tashkend  by  the  inroads  of  the  Chirchik.  The  third  station  is  situated  at 
the  confluence  of  the  Chirchik  and  the  Syr-daria  at  Yani-Chinaz,  or  New 
Chinaz ;  Old  Chinaz,  which  is  more  populous  than  the  New,  being  passed 
on  the  road.  At  New  Chinaz  is  a  fort,  800  feet  above  the  sea,  guarding 
the  ferry  over  the  river.  The  expectation  of  the  conquerors  that  this 
spot  would  become  a  place  of  commercial  importance  has  been  thus 
far  disappointed,  and  it  remains  a  Russian  settlement  of  a  few  houses, 
though  nominally  the  "port"  of  Tashkend;  but  the  navigation  of  the 
Syr  is  so  uncertain  that  there  is  no  regular  service  of  boats,  either  of  the 
Aral  flotilla  or  of  private  companies.  The  river  is  here  about  two- 
thirds  of  a  mile  wide,  the  current  rapid,  and  the  water  yellow  and 
muddy.  The  banks  are  thickly  covered  with  high  reeds,  affording  an 
excellent  covert  for  tigers. 

Beyond  the  river,  almost  to  Jizakh,  there  extends  a  parched  and  barren 
waste,  known  as  the  •'Golodnaia,'*  or  Hungry  Steppe,  the  route 
across  it  being  marked  by  four  stations,  with  wells  and  cisterns  of 
brackish  and  unpleasant  water.  Between  the  river  and  the  first  station, 
Malek,  there  are  traces  of  old  canals  and  ditches,  showing  that  there  at 
least  the  land  at  one  time  had  been  cultivated.  It  is  known  also.  Dr. 
Schuyler  says,  that  some  portions  of  the  Steppe,  on  the  opposite  side, 
near  to  the  mountains,  were  formerly  inhabited  and  worked  by  means 
of  a  canal,  brought  from  the  River  Zarafshan  through  a  small  mountain 


478  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

September  21st,  a  distance  of  94  miles,  in  7  stages.* 
On  our  way  we  had  to  pass  over  or  through  several 
rivers,  the  Chirchik,  Kara-Su,  and  more  than  one 
stream  of  the  Angren.  The  most  important  of  these 
is  the  Chirchik.  One  of  its  branches  is  the  Kara-Su. 
It  gives  some  of  its  water  also  to  the  Keles.f 

The  two  valleys  watered  by  the  Chirchik  and 
Angren  form  the  richest,  most  fertile,  and  thickly 
populated  part  of  the  uyezd  or  district  called  Kurama. 
It  is  the  granary  of  Tashkend  and  the  surrounding 
country,  so  that,  in  passing  southwards,  the  traveller 
has  the  opportunity  of  seeing  something  not  only  of 
the    ordinary    vegetation    of    Turkistan,   but  also   of 

pass.  It  appears,  however,  from  the  Chinese  traveller,  Tch'ang-Tch'un^ 
in  1222,  and  from  the  memoirs  of  Hiouen  Thsang,  600  years  previously, 
that  this  steppe  was,  for  the  more  part,  in  much  the  same  condition  as 
now.  At  the  next  station  beyond  Malek  are  the  ruins  of  an  old  caravan- 
sary, called  Murza-rabat,  said  to  have  been  built  at  the  end  of  the  six- 
teenth century  by  Abdullah  Khan.  The  building  is  made  of  large  square 
bricks,  and  consists  of  a  central  room,  surmounted  by  a  dome,  and 
surrounded  w^ith  small  vaulted  rooms,  each  having  its  little  cupola.  It 
is  now  occupied  as  a  post-station,  and  affords  to  the  summer  traveller  a 
cool  retreat  from  the  hot  steppe.  At  the  next  station,  Agachty,  there 
were  formerly  similar  buildings,  under  the  ruins  of  which  chambers  are 
now  hollowed  out.  Jizakh  is  25  miles  further  on,  and  as  it  is  approached, 
mountains  come  into  view,  and  the  barrenness  of  the  Steppe  is  exchanged 
for  trees  and  fields,  which  continue  more  or  less  to  Samarkand. 
•  The  stations  and  intervening  distances  in  versts  are  as  follows ; —

t  The  Chirchik  rises  in  the  western  continuation  of  the  Alexander 
range,  and  for  about  25  miles  flows  at  the  bottom  of  a  narrow  and  deep 
defile,  from  which  no  aryks  are  cut.  Rapidly  falling  and  opening  out, 
the  valley  of  the  Chirchik  at  Tashkend  has  a  breadth  of  25  miles.  In 
its  further  course  the  valley  approaches  that  of  the  Angren  till  they 
merge  in  one,  and  the  Chirchik  falls  into  the  Jaxartes  about  7  miles 
from  what  should  be  the  mouth  of  the  Angren,  only  that  the  river  has 
run  dry,  exhausted  by  its  numerous  canals.

Central  Asian  agriculture.  The  surface  of  Russian 
Turkistan,  viewed  with  reference  to  vegetation 
generally,  may  be  conveniently  divided  into  the 
mountain  country,  oases,  steppes,  and  deserts ;  and 
of  these  last  I  shall  speak  when  they  come  in  my 
path.  I  have  already  touched  upon  the  arboreous 
vegetation  of  the  mountains  in  Semirechia,  quoting 
such  authorities  as  Semenoff,  Osten-Sacken,  Regel, 
Severtsoff,  and  others.  To  these  travellers  in  the 
eastern  portion  of  the  Thian  Shan  must  be  added 
Dr.  Capus,  who  travelled  in  the  western  portion, 
preceding  me  by  one  year  only,  and  to  some  of  whose 
papers,  since  published,  I  am  indebted  for  information. 
Taking  first  the  upper  and  lower  limits  of  the  growth 
of  trees,  they  run,  says  Dr.  Capus,  parallel  to  the  line 
of  perpetual  snow,  which  varies  in  the  western  Thian 
Shan,  according  to  MM.  Kaulbars  and  Osten-Sacken, 
from  8,800  to  9,800  feet.* 

•  At  Issik-Kul  the  Juniper  {Juniperus  pseudosabzna)  is  found, 
according  to  M.  Kegel,  up  to  14,000  feet.  Dr.  Capus  found  its  lower 
limit  in  the  Bokhariot  mountains  of  Baissoune  to  be  4,000,  and  in  the 
Zarafshan  valley  about  3,800  feet.  In  the  Alexandrof  range,  the  farther 
to  the  west,  the  larger  is  the  tree.  In  the  Kirghese  Ala-Tau  at  Urianda, 
the  trunks  are  about  14  feet  high.  The  21-feet  stems  in  the  Badam 
heights  are  from  14  to  18  inches  thick.  The  high-stemmed  junipers 
seen  by  Severtsoff  had  generally  a  bare  trunk  for  half  their  height,  the 
sparse  branches  measuring  about  one-fourth  of  the  altitude  of  the 
tree,  the  top  of  which  was  generally  broken.  Above  a  certain  height 
this  tree  becomes  stunted,  and  becomes  almost  horizontal,  with  the 
branches  only  jutting  upwards.  Towards  the  south,  where  the  woods 
decrease,  the  juniper  grows  higher,  but  it  is  replaced  on  the  moun- 
tains by  firs  and  birches.  The  limits  of  the  Birch  tree  {BetulUy  sp. 
not  European)  are  from  3,200  to  8,8co  feet.  Its  lower  limit  depends 
upon  the  nature  of  the  valley  in  which  it  grows,  and  the  specimens 
are  small,  crooked,  and  with  broken  tops,  probably  from  the  snow- 
fall. In  the  Kirghese  Ala-Tau  the  inferior  limit  of  the  birch  nearly 
coincides  with  that  of  the  fir,  whilst  in  the  Kara-Bura  mountains, 
at  the  sources  of  the  Chatkal,  the  superior  limit  of  the  birch  and  the 
tall-stemmed  junipers  coincides  with  that  of  the  sorb  apple.     The

Among  the  Turkistan  shrubs  are  found  two  species 
of  Hawthorn  in  the  valley  of  the  Talas.  In  some  places 
it  grows  to  the  dimensions  of  a  tree  with  a  straight 
trunk  1 8  feet  high  and  i8  inches  thick.  About  the 
sources  of  the  Tchaian  it  attains  to  20  feet  in  height. 
In  Semirechia  M.  Semenoff  found  two  species  of 
Buckthorn,  the  Spindle  Tree,  and  three  varieties  of 
Cherry,  the  Cotoneaster,  and  Mountain  Ash.  The 
Tamarisk,  too,  is  there  represented  by  six  varieties.* 

Turning  from  forest  trees  to  those  of  the  gardens, 
one  meets  in  Central  Asia  with  a  kind  of  elm  called 
Karagatch,  frequently  planted,  I  observed,  for  the 
shade  it  affords,  near  pools  of  water.  Its  trunks  yield 
timber,  often  to  be  met  with  as  carved  pillars  in  native 
mansions.  There  is  also  a  species  of  Plane  {Platanus 
orientalis\  called  chinars,  and  a  wild  Olive  called 
jida  (Eleagnus  hortensis  et  E.  angustifolia).     We  often 

Willow,  of  which  there  are  upwards  of  nineteen  varieties,  is  found  in  the 
valley  of  the  Talas  and  in  the  Kara-Bura  at  heights  varying  from  5,200 
to  9,900  feet,  whilst  the  Picea  Schrenkiana^  one  of  the  rare  conifers  of 
the  Thian  Shan,  descends  in  the  Alexander  range  to  5,300  feet,  and 
ascends  in  the  Ala-Tau  to  8,000  feet.  Of  five  kinds  of  Poplars,  that 
like  the  Russian  aspen  is  found  in  the  woods  along  the  Talas  ;  and  on 
the  River  Kara-Bura  are  two  thickets  of  similar  large  old  trees,  but  of 
an  intermediate  form  between  the  black  poplar  and  the  aspen.  The 
Turanta  poplar  [Populus  dwersi/olia)  is  found  in  the  woods  on  the 
Arys.  To  tiese  trees  may  be  added  two  species  of  Ash  in  the  gorges 
along  the  Boroldai  and  its  affluents. 

*  To  the  foregoing  may  be  added  the  rare  shrub  called  Boialysh 
{Atraphaxis),  found  in  the  dry  sandy  clay  lands  at  the  mouth  of  the 
Boroldai ;  also  the  insignificant  Ephedra,  or  jointed  fir,  in  the  grey 
parched  soil  of  the  Steppe,  between  the  canals  of  the  River  Asa.  In  the 
valley  of  the  Kitch-Kine- Kara-Bura  are  several  small  prickly  shrubs, 
like  those  near  the  Syr-daria,  and  with  the  same  reddish  flowers.  They 
grow  principally  at  an  altitude  of  between  4,000  and  5,000  feet.  I  was 
surprised  not  to  find  in  the  gardens  of  Turkistan  either  gooseberry  or 
currant  bushes.  Black  currants,  however,  are  said  to  grow  wild  at  the 
source  of  the  Chatkal,  and  in  Semirechia  there  are  red  currants,  and  four 
others  of  the  Ribes  tribe.     Dr.  Capus  mentions  also  in  Kohistan  the

saw  the  latter,  with  its  yellow-reddish,  olive-like  fruit, 
hanging  over  the  garden  walls.  I  recalled  having 
met  with  it  in  the  Trans-Caucasus,  near  Etchmiadzin, 
where  I  did  not  care  for  the  taste  sufficiently  to  eat 
it.  When  growing  wild  in  thickets,  the  jida  has 
smaller  fruit,  which,  when  ripe,  is  of  a  greenish-grey 
hue.  The  white  Mulberry  {Morus  alba)  is  one  of 
the  commonest  trees  in  Turkistan,  and  is  cultivated 
along  the  first  river  we  crossed,  the  Chirchik,  chiefly 
for  the  sake  of  its  timber.  It  attains  to  a  height  of 
35  feet,  and  to  14  inches  in  diameter.  North  of 
Tashkend  the  tree  is  less  common,  and  is  particularly 
small  at  Aulie-Ata.  Dr.  Schuyler  mentions  four  dis- 
tinct varieties :  the  hassaky  or  wild  Mulberry  tree  ;  the 
shah-tut,  brought  originally  from  Persia ;  the  Balkhi, 
introduced  from  Balkh,  the  largest  and  most  beautiful 
variety  of  all ;  and  the  Khorasmi,  from  Kharezm  or 
Khiva.     Of  some  species  the  fruit  is  so  little  esteemed 

Honeysuckle,  Barberry,  Medlar,  and  Sea  Buckthorn,  growing  in  great 
abundaiice  at  a  height  of  about  8,000  feet,  whilst  in  the  Chirchik  moun- 
tains the  wild  Plum,  Pistachio  nuts  {Pistacia  vera)y  and  wild  Almonds 
are  found  4,000  feet  lower.     In  Ablatoune  the  same  explorer  found  the 
superior  limit  of  the  nut  and  the  wild  Apple  to  be  about  4,500  feet,  with 
the  Ash  {Fraxinus  Sogdiana]^  and  a  species  of  Maple.     In  the  same 
valley  wild  Apricot  trees  grew  up  to  4,000,  and  on  the  shores  of  the 
Iskander-Kul  even  to  7,000  feet.     Lastly,  I  must  not  omit  to  mention  one 
shrub  which  grows  abundantly  in  the  valleys  of  the  Syr-daria,  because 
on  its  thorns  there  collects  a  sugary  material  called  Yantak-shakary 
or  taran-jobtn ;  but  it  is  remarkable  that  the  same  shrub,  when  growing 
on  the  mountains,  yields  no  saccharine  matter.     It  resembles  batalig,  is 
acid  in  taste,  and  liked  by  the  camels.     From  this  plant,  after  rain, 
taran-jobiriy  or  manna,  is  collected,  of  which,  with  the  Pistachio,  are 
made  ruckta  and  other  well-known  Bokhariot  confections.    Concerning 
this  manna,  the  Bokhariots  have  a  story  that  beyond  the  Syr  the  steppe 
is  covered  with  dust  of  a  grey-yellowish  colour,  called  taran-jobin.    This 
dust  is  supposed  to  fall  early  every  morning  during  the  three  summer 
months,  specially  near  the  holy  city  of  Turkistan,  along  the  left  bank  of 
the  Syr-daria,  where  it  is  collected  by  the  natives  up  to  sunrise,  but 
with  the  first  rays  of  the  sun  it  becomes  mixed  with  the  soil  and  sinks.

that  the  natives  in    Bokhara  told  me   they   did   not 
take   the    trouble    to    gather   it ;     but    they    use    for 
food  the  large  white  berries,  both  fresh  and  dried,  as 
well  as  made  into  a  flour,  and  mixed  with  water  for 
a  beverage,   or  with  wheat  flour  for  a  paste,   called 
tut'lialvah.     The    chief  use   of    the    Mulberry    tree, 
however,  is  for  feeding  silkworms,  for  which  purpose 
not  the  twigs  merely,   but   all  the  branches  are  cut 
off,  and  the  tree  reduced  thereby  to  a  pollard.     In 
the  gardens  of  Kurama  grow,  in  addition  to  the  fore- 
mentioned,   Peaches,  Apricots  (which  form  the  staple 
of  Khokand  gardens).   Pomegranates,  Apples,  Pears, 
Quinces,  Plums,  Almonds,  more  than  a  dozen  varieties 
of  Grapes,  and  Figs.     Some  of  these  last,  of  a  whitish 
colour,  and  smaller  than  the  green  fig  commonly  seen 
in  England,  were  offered  us  in  the  Tashkend  bazaar. 
Cucurbitaceous  plants  abound  in  Turkistan,  among 
which  the  Melons  are  of  exquisite  flavour.     Gourds 
{Cucurbita  lagenarta)   are   grown    in  large   numbers, 
and   serve   the   various   purposes   of  tobacco    boxes, 
pipes,    and    water    cruses.       Amongst    umbelliferous 
plants    Coriander    is    used    as    seasoning    for     food, 
and    as  a   carminative.      For    seasoning    or    against 
flatulence,  shabit,  or    sweet    Fennel  {Anethum  /cent- 
culum   dulce)y    is   used,    which   does    not    grow    wild 
in  Turkistan,  but  is  cultivated  in  kitchen  gardens,  as 
is  also  another   kind  of    Fennel    {Nigella  Romano). 
The  grain  is   greenish   and  oily.      To   these   should 
be  added  certain  plants  for  dyeing,   such  as  Kltana, 
giving  a  green    powder,    containing  an  essential  oil. 
On  blotting-paper    it    gives  a  stain  that  evaporates, 
whilst  cold    water   infusion   easily  extracts  from  it  a 
pigment  of  a  reddish  colour.     The  colouring  matter,  of 
Spariak  (or  Ispariak,  a  recent  addition  to  the  Larkspur 


FROM  TASHKEND  TO  KHOJEND.  4B3 

family)  is  dissolved  in  boiling  water,  and  produces 
a  yellow  mixture,  with  a  peculiar  smell  and  bitter  taste. 
It  is  procured  from  the  dried  flowers  of  a  species 
of  Larkspur  {^Delphinium  ochroleucunty  Mey.),  growing 
wild  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  Turkistan  moun- 
tains, and  also  throughout  Turan.  Like  the  English 
species,  it  grows  about  two  feet  high.  Byzgunj 
Is  also  a  vegetable  dye,  used  for  making  substances 
black,  and  is  obtained  apparently  from  galls  of  the 
Pistachio  tree.  Madder  {Rubia  tznctorum)  is  sown  in 
submerged  places,  and  Saffron  {Carthamus  tinctorius) 
grows  in  the  fields. 

I  have  said  that  the  district  of  Kurama  is  the 
granary  of  Tashkend.  Now  land  under  culture  in 
Central  Asia  is  of  two  kinds :  that  which  lies  near 
the  mountains,  and  receives  the  rain,  is  called  lialmi ; 
whilst  that  which  is  watered  by  irrigation,  abi.  Com- 
paring an  average  barley  harvest  on  rain-land  with  one 
on  irrigated  land,  the  result,  according  to  the  Turkistan 
Kalendar,  appears  to  be  the  same  ;  but  whilst  a  batman 
of  wheat  sown  on  3  acres  of  rain  land  yields  from  1 7  to 
20  cwt.,  it  gives  on  irrigated  land  in  the  same  locality 
from  17  to  23  cwt. 

Turkistan  wheat  {budai)  is  of  two  kinds :  red  and 
white,  or  winter  and  spring.  Maize  is  cultivated, 
but  in  small  quantities.  Oats  will  not  grow,  it  is 
said,  in  Central  Asia.  They,  and  barley  also, 
to  a  considerable  extent,  are  replaced  by  jugara 
{Holcus  sp.),  a  kind  of  Sugary  Sorghum  or  Indian 
millet,  the  grain  of  which  is  used  for  gruel,  and  the 
old  stems  for  fuel,  whilst  the  young  stems  and  leaves, 
which  are  not  very  sweet,  make  good  fodder  for  cattle. 
One  species  of  oat  grass,  being  considered  less  heating 
than  barley,  is  cultivated  principally  for  horse  fodder.

as  also  is  Kunak,  which  resembles  fox-tail  grass.  The 
tablelands  of  the  Boroldai  and  Katurnan-su  are  said 
to  be  the  true  native  land  of  rye.  Here  it  grows 
luxuriantly,  and,  with  full  ears,  flowers  in  May  and 
ripens  in  June  ;  but  this  crop  does  not  appear  to  have 
been  cultivated  before  the  advent  of  the  Russians, 
who  raise  a  little  for  their  own  use.  Rice  is  sown 
on  land  where  water  abounds,  and  also  millet,  of 
which  there  are  three  varieties.  Millet  ripens  early, 
and  is  therefore  used  for  the  second  crop  after  winter 
wheat.  Flax  and  Rape  are  cultivated,  but  chiefly  for 
the  sake  of  the  oil  they  yield.  In  Kohistan,  both 
flax  and  wheat  were  met  with  by  Dr.  Capus  at  an 
altitude  of  10,000  feet.  The  cultivation  of  Hemp 
has  been  introduced  into  certain  suburbs  by  lovers 
of  the    intoxicating   hashish* 

I     have    thus    entered    somewhat    fully    into    the

subject  of  trees  and  corn  crops  of  both  the  moun- 
tain and  oasis  districts  of  Turkistan,  as  suggested 
by  typical  growths  in  the  Kurama  gardens  and 
fields  through  which  we  passed.  Our  journey 
onward  did  not  equal  in  despatch  our  approach  to 
Tashkend.  We  were  kindly  supplied  with  letters, 
as  before,  to  the  post-masters,  to  expedite  our 
journey,  and  had  intended  to  start  on  the  morning  of 
Thursday;  but  not  having  given  notice,  there  were  no 
horses  to  be  had  until  evening,  at  which  time  there 
were  two  other  travellers  to  be  supplied,  who  were 
proceeding  in  the  same  direction,  one  the  uyezdi- 
nacfialnik,  or  chief  of  the  district  of  Khokand,  and  the 
other,  M.  Ushakoff,  a  judge,  whom  we  had  met  at 
the  officers*  club,  and  at  the  dinner  table  of  the 
Governor-General,  and  who  had  invited  us  to  stay 
with  him  during  our  visit  to  Khokand.  He  had  been 
spending  a  short  holiday  in  Tashkend,  and  now  asked 
us,  as  he  was  returning,  to  allow  him  to  get  first  to 
Khokand,  to  be  in  readiness  to  receive  us.  Accord- 
ingly, he  trotted  out  of  Tashkend  ahead,  we  next,  and 
the  district  chief  third  ;  but  at  the  first  station  the  chief 
came  in  close  upon  our  heels,  and  by  some  means 
managed  to  get  his  horses  changed,  and  to  leave 
before  us.  This  was  against  **  the  rule  of  the  road"; 
but  the    yemstchik    said  that    the    starosta  had    told 

cultivated.  Santolina  seed,  an  anthelmintic,  is  obtained  from  a  wild 
plant  from  10  to  14  inches  high,  found  in  abundance  both  in  the 
plains  and  in  the  mountains  of  Central  Asia.  The  Tashkendians 
employ  the  Kuramas  and  Kirghese  to  cut  and  harvest  the  green  stems, 
at  the  extremity  of  which  is  a  sort  of  purse,  or  little  bag,  about  4 
inches  in  length,  and  a  finger  thick,  containing  the  seed.  These 
native  gatherers,  to  facilitate  their  work,  often  pull  up  the  plant  by  the 
roots,  and  thereby  lessen  the  abundance  of  future  collections ;  but  in 
a  fruitful  year  there  is  exported  from  the  district  between  Tashkend 
and  Turkistan  from  2,500  to  3,000  camel-loads,  or  from  570  to  730  tons.

him  to  let  the  chief  drive  out  before  us.  This  placed 
a  second  traveller  in  our  front,  unless,  indeed,  we 
.  could  outstrip  him.  There  was  little  chance  of  this, 
however,  since  he  had  a  mere  handful  of  baggage  and 
a  light  telega,  whilst  our  poor  tarantass  was  more 
heavily  laden  than  it  had  been  before.  Added  to  this, 
when  we  reached  the  Kara-Su  the  floods  had  risen^ 
making  the  road  so  heavy  that  we  could  travel  only 
slowly.  Pskent  and  Uralsk  we  passed  in  the  night, 
but  at  the  latter  station  they  gave  us  three  such 
miserable  horses  that,  after  going  four  miles,  we  stuck 
in  the  mire.  How  long  we  so  remained  I  have  but  a 
hazy  idea,  for  I  was  safe  in  the  arms  of  Morpheus,  and 
learned  only  post  factum  that  we  had  been  obliged  to 
send  back  to  the  station  for  two  more  horses.  Hence, 
by  breakfast  time,  we  had  only  reached  Djan-bulak,. 
the  fifth  station,  to  find  there  were  no  horses. 

The  aspect  of  the  country  had  now  changed  con- 
siderably. We  had  left  behind  the  oasis,  and  had 
entered  the  steppe,  the  third  typical  division  of  the 
surface  of  the  Turkistan  country.  The  steppe,  how- 
ever, is  of  varied  character,  and  in  some  parts  presents 
in  spring  the  appearance  of  a  vast  flower  garden 
covered  with  herbage,  amongst  which  Tulips  and 
Anemones  alternate  agreeably  amidst  brilliant  spots  of 
yellow,  white,  and  scarlet  blossoms  of  other  bulbs. 
This  portion  of  the  Kurama  district  is  exceedingly 
valuable,  because  the  quantity  of  land  irrigated  by  the 
Chirchik  and  Angren  is  at  best  but  limited,  and  a 
large  portion  of  the  natives  consequently  devote  them- 
selves to  stock-raising,  for  which,  of  course,  a  certain 
amount  of  fodder  is  grown,  though  it  is  not  customary 
here  to  stable  the  cattle  for  the  winter,  or  to  provide 
them  with  hay.     For  the  winter  pasture,  therefore,  a 


FROM  TASHKEND  TO  KHOJEND,  487 

place  must  be  chosen  where  the  wind  is  not  too  violent, 
nor  the  snow  too  deep.* 

The  journey  was  too  late  in  autumn  to  allow  of  our 
seeing  much  beauty  in  the  vegetation  of  the  steppe, 
but  there  was  a  large  quantity  of  fodder  stored  at 
Djan-bulak,  where  we  arrived  in  the  morning  and 
ordered  the  samovar  from  a  post-mistress  who  appeared 
fully  able  to  speak  for  herself,  and  was  smoking.  The 
station-rooms  were  large,  and  the  post-master  obliging. 
He  had  received  no  notification  of  our  coming,  but 
when  he  saw  my  letter  he  said  that  if  he  had  he  would 
certainly  have  kept  back  the  district  chief,  who,  happily 
for  himself,  had  gone  before.  At  this  juncture  a  wily 
Tatar,  keeper  of  a  caravansary,  appeared  on  the  scene, 
and  offered  private  horses,  which,  to  my  cost,  I 
accepted,  inasmuch  as  his  right-wheeler  was  the  only 
one  out  of  the  800  horses  I  hired  in  Central  Asia 
that  alarmed  me  as  to  whether  it  would  not  dash  the 
carriage  to  pieces ;  for  when  the  traces  were  fastened, 
he  gave  such  a  bound  forward  as  to  burst  away  from 
everything.     We  therefore  caught  and  harnessed  him 

♦  Among  the  varieties  of  steppe  vegetation  that  serve  for  fodder  is 
a  poor  one  called  Ibelek  (^Ceratocarpus  sp.),  on  which  the  Kirghese, 
in  winter,  feed  their  herds ;  also  in  other  places  of  limited  extent  are 
met  with  Kyiak  {Centinodia  polygonum  latifolium),  and  jusan 
{Absinthe),  both  of  which  serve  as  fodder  for  sheep  and  goats.  A 
more  nourishing  fodder,  found  on  the  Myn-bulak,  is  called  Kipets, 
and  another  not  so  good  is  Kamys-chob,  or  reed  grass.  This  latter 
grows  so  abundantly  on  the  swampy  banks  and  islands  of  the  Turkistan 
rivers  that  it  chokes  other  similar  grasses.  It  is  used  as  food  for  cows 
and  horses,  but  it  is  so  tasteless  and  little  nourishing  that  the  cattle  eat 
it  very  unwillingly,  and  animals  unaccustomed  to  it,  especially  Russian 
horses,  are  often  made  sick  thereby.  This  reed  serves  as  a  common 
article  for  fuel,  and  a  similar  plant,  called  Shye,  furnishes  material 
for  the  double  matting  with  which  the  Kirghese  cover  their  kibitkas. 
There  is  yet  another  class  of  fodder  grasses,  known  by  more  than  a 
dozen  different  native  names,  that  grow  wild  abundantly  in  unwatered 
localities  in  Turkistan.     In  taste  they  are  sour  and  salt,  though  some-

again,  and  trotted  over  a  flat,  stony  steppe,  the  road 
now  proceeding  for  25  miles  in  an  easterly  direction, 
instead  of  southerly  as  heretofore,  and  having  on  our 
left  ranges  of  hills  rising  in  peaks,  for  the  most  part 
bare,  rough,  and  rocky,  but  here  and  there  showing 
patches  of  verdure.  Though  late  in  the  season  for 
butterflies,  we  took  a  few  specimens,  and  passed 
through  what  appeared  to  be  a  swarm  of  dragon  flies, 
so  numerous  that  Mr.  Sevier  caught  several  by  merely 
holding  out  the  net  from  the  carriage. 

On  reaching  the  next  station,  Murza-rabat,  we  found 
it,  like  the  last,  to  be  nothing  less  than  a  miniature 
fortress.  It  was  surrounded  with  a  dry  moat  and  lofty 
walls,  measuring  inside  60  paces  square.  There  was 
a  well  in  the  centre  of  the  yard,  and  against  the  wall 
stables  and  buildings,  some  of  which  struck  me  at  first 
as  intended  for  an  ^tape  prison.  Outside  by  the  road 
was  a  grave,  with  a  monument  raised  by  travellers' 
gifts  to  the  memory  of  the  starosta  Jacobleff  and  hife 
yemstchiks,  who  on  the  i8th  of  August,  1875,  had 
defended  the  post-house  against  a  band  of  Khokandians, 
by  whom  they  had  been  killed,  and  subsequently  to 
which  event  the  fortress  had  been  erected. 

what  succulent.  The  majority  of  them  have  prickles  and  thorns,  and  of 
domesticated  animals  the  camel  alone  eats  them.  One  is  called 
Jantak  or  camel's  tail  [Alhagi  camelorum).  The  ro^ts  of  another, 
Kukfeky  are  collected  in  large  quantities  for  fuel  in  winter ;  as  also  are 
a  species  of  lily  called  Saran,  and  A  labyma,  or  goose-foot,  yungurcha , 
or  clover,  is  cultivated,  but  there  is  also  a  kind  called  Jan-shikehy 
{Medicago  sp.),  that  grows  wild  along  the  canals  of  some  of  the  rivers. 
Another  allied  species  is  the  Dlafty-skkeh,  possibly  the  same  as  the 
Chinese  Mu-sue. 

I  have  thus  endeavoured  to  give  the  reader  some  idea  of  the  vegeta- 
tion of  Turkistan  (omitting  some  things  that  have  been  admirably 
treated  by  Dr.  Schuyler),  and  getting  my  information  largely  from  a 
list  of  Turkistan  plants  drawn  up  in  Russian  by  a  committee  for  the 
expedition  of  M.  Fedchenko,  and  not  before  translated,  so  far  as  I  am 
aware,  into  English.

Our  road  now  turned  again  to  the  south  over  a 
depression  in  a  mountain  chain,  which  gave  us  the 
Kurama-Tau  on  our  left,  and  the  snow-capped  eleva- 
tions of  the  Mogol-Tau  on  the  right.  Eagles  were 
flying  about,  and  larks  and  wagtails,  all  of  which  we 
had  time  to  admire,  for,  as  the  road  continued  to 
ascend,  the  carriage  proceeded  so  slowly  that  it  was 
pleasanter  to  walk  ahead  and  enjoy  the  scenery  ;  and 
when  at  last,  towards  3  o'clock,  we  reached  the  crest 
of  the  hills,  and  looked  down  upon  the  ancient 
Jaxartes,  and  Khojend  nestling  among  the  trees,  the 
view  was  one  of  the  prettiest  we  had  seen  in  Russian 
Central  Asia.  The  town  with  its  old  earthen  forts 
looked  well  by  the  river  side,  as  did  the  Russian 
church  and  wooden  bridge.  By  the  latter  we  crossed 
the  stream,  and  drove  to  the  house  of  Colonel 
Putimsoff,  the  uyezdni  nachalnik,  there  to  enjoy  a 
hospitable  meal  before  quitting  the  Syr-daria  province 
for  Ferghana.

towns  and  sacred  places. 

FERGHANA  is  an  old  name,  reimposed  by  the 
Russians  on  what  was  formerly  known  as  part 
of  the  Khokand  Khanate.  The  name  is  found  in  its 
present  form  in  Arab  manuscripts  of  the  eighth  and 
ninth  centuries,  but  the  Chinese  knew  it  under  the 
spelling  of  Feihan  as  far  back  as  the  fourth  century. 
The  province  resembles  a  vast  ellipse,  of  which  the 
periphery  is  formed  of  lofty  chains  of  terraced  moun- 
tains. As  Mr.  Robert  Michell  says,  **  Fancy  the 
interior  of  the  Coliseum  of  Rome,  or  even  the  Albert 
Hall  in  London,  and  you  have  an  approximate  idea 
of  the  Ferghana  valley,  which,  except  on  the  west^ 
is  surrounded  by  portions  of  the  Thian  Shan."* 

•  On  the  north  a  broad  mountain  mass  separates  this  valley  from  that 
of  the  Talas,  whilst  on  the  south  another  mass  divides  it  from  the  basin 
of  the  Oxus.  On  the  east  is  Kashgar.  The  frontier  between  runs 
along  the  watershed  for  about  70  miles ;  then  strikes  south,  embrac- 
ing some  territory  in  the  basin  of  the  Oxus.      Next  it  returns  to  the 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  FERGHANA.  491 

The  area  of  the  province  is  estimated  at  from  28,000 
to  30,000  square  miles,  of  which  about  four-fifths 
consist  of  mountains,  and  the  remainder  occupies  the 
broad  valley  of  the  Upper  Jaxartes,  the  level  portion 
lying  south  of  the  river,  which  runs  through  the  pro- 
vince from  north-east  to  south-west."*  The  range  of 
mountains  on  the  south  bore  for  a  long  time  the 
unmeaning  name  of  Kashgar-Davan — ix,,  pass  into 
Kashgar;  but  Fedchenko  designated  them  the  **  South 
Khokand"  range.  It  has  a  lateral  direction,  form- 
ing to  the  east  a  watershed  between  the  basins  of 
the  Jaxartes  and  Lob  Nor.  and  westwards  between 
the  systems  of  the  Jaxartes  and  Oxus ;  the  range 
dividing    on    about    the     70th    meridian     into    three 

watersheds  between  the  Oxus  and  the  Jaxartes,  and  continues  along 
the  northern  watershed  of  the  Zarafshan.  In  about  longitude  70**  the 
western  frontier  takes  a  meridional  direction,  bordering  the  Syr-daria 
oblast. 

*  The  greatest  breadth  of  the  plain  is  65  miles,  its  greatest 
length  about  160  miles,  and  its  area  5,775  square  miles.  M.  Ujfalv}' 
divides  the  surface  concentrically  into  three  fertile,  alternated  with  three 
sterile,  zones.  Among  the  former,  he  refers  to  a  belt  of  good  earth,, 
presenting  a  succession  of  orchards,  gardens,  and  fields  surrounded 
with  trees,  and  to  another  spot  with  the  aspect  of  an  English  park, 
between  the  Naryn  and  the  Kara-daria  rivers.  A  second  band  of  soiU 
not  less  fertile,  and  enjoying  a  more  temperate  climate,  lies  round  the 
province  with  certain  interruptions  on  the  slopes  of  the  lowest  hills,  whilst 
a  third  belt,  quite  mountainous  and  covered  with  thick  pasturage,  en- 
circles Ferghana  on  the  north,  east,  and  south.  These  belts  are  sepa- 
rated by  sterile  zones,  of  which  the  first,  on  the  banks  of  the  Jaxartes,  is 
a  steppe,  sometimes  grassy,  sometimes  stony.  The  second,  between  the 
upper  two  fertile  zones,  is  generally  stony;  and  the  third,  which  separates 
the  mountain  pastures  from  the  valley  of  the  Alai,  is  of  great  height  and 
extreme  sterility.  This  varied  aspect  of  the  surface  will  prepare  the 
reader  for  the  remark  of  Mr.  R.  Michell,  that  within  the  small  compass 
of  the  valley  there  are  heaped,  as  it  were,  both  profusion  and  poverty, 
so  that  between  Khokand  and  Varukh  the  traveller  may  hunger  and 
thirst ;  between  Ush  and  Uzgend  he  may  starve  his  horse ;  between 
Andijan  and  Namangan  both  may  suffer;  and  between  Khokand  and 
Khojend  they  may  perish  in  the  desert,  whilst  in  each  of  these  districts, 
at  certain  spots,  may  be  tasted  the  most  delicious  fruits  of  the  earth.

chains,  all  continuing  in  a  westerly  direction,  and 
named  the  Turkistan,  Zarafshan,  and  Hissar  ranges. 
Approached  from  the  Ferghana  valley,  this  southern 
boundary  is  seen  to  consist  of  receding  parallel 
ranges,  which  rise  from  ii,ooo  to  upwards  of  20,000 
feet,  the  latter  height  being  attained  by  the  moun- 
tains of  the  Alai  plateau.  These,  with  a  small  portion 
of  the  Pamir,  make  up  the  south-eastern  angle  of  the 
province,  and  lie  outside  the  forementioned  ellipse. 
It  is,  however,  a  remarkable  portion  of  the  province, 
and  may  be  said  to  form  part  of  the  northern  crest  of 
Bam-i'duniah,  **the  roof  of  the  world"  ;  or,  as  some 
would  translate  it,  '*  the  crown  of  the  world's  head/* 
This  name  is  given  to  the  crest  north  of  Hindustan, 
where  meet  the  two  mountain  masses  of  Tibet  and  the 
Pamir,  and  which  separates  completely  the  two  halves 
of  Asia.  It  is  one  of  the  most  elevated  tablelands 
in  the  world;  **the  lakes  are  frozen  there  in  July; 
the  atmosphere  is  so  rare  that  the  blood  oozes  out 
of  the  pores  ;  the  country  is  a  desert,  where  grass 
sprouts  up  only  here  and  there  ;  and  the  road  thither 
over  the  Alai  range  runs  along  mountain  ledges,  from 
which  horses  frequently  tumble  down  below."  We  owe 
such  accurate  information  as  we  possess  of  this  spot 
to  the  Russian  explorers  and  scientists,  Fedchenko, 
Kostenko,  Severtsoff,  and  others.* 

*  Fedchenko  proceeded  to  Khokand  in  1871,  and  approached  the 
Alai  from  Uch-Kurgan  by  the  Isfairam  Pass,  12,000  feet  high.  The 
Alai  is  a  tableland  about  8,000  feet  high,  at  the  head  of  the  Surkhab, 
and  measures  some  40  miles  in  length  by  12  in  breadth.  On  the  north 
and  south  are  mountain  ranges,  the  former  called  Kichik-Alai,  down 
the  slopes  of  which  Fedchenko  descended  to  the  very  banks  of  the 
Surkhab,  or,  as  it  is  there  called,  the  Kyzyl-Su.  He  saw  in  the  distance 
the  southern  and  higher  range,  whose  snowy  peaks  he  judged  must 
exceed  20,000  feet  in  height,  and  the  most  elevated  of  which,  in  this 
Trans- Alai  range,  he  named  after  von  Kaufmann,  the  Governor-General. 

Fedchenko  was  followed,  five  years  later,  by  General  Skobeleff,  who 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  FERGHANA,  495 

The  number  of  streams  flowing  down  from  this 
region  is  rather  large,  particularly  of  those  issuing 
from  the  southern  mountains,  such  as  the  rivers  Isfara, 
Sokh,  Shah-i-mardan,  and  Ak-Bura.  They  are  formed 
of  many  streams,  only  a  few  of  them  taking  their 
source  from  glaciers.  From  the  northern  mountains 
flow  some  small  streams  and  one  large  one,  the 
Naryn,  which,  with  the  Kara-daria  coming  from 
the  east,  forms  the  Syr-daria.  Into  this  river  the 
numerous  surrounding  streams  ought  to  flow,  but 
the  natives  have  learned  to  divert  them  from  their 
course  by  creating  a  vast  system  of  irrigation,  and 
by    that   means   have  redeemed  a   considerable  tract 

commanded  a  detachment  that  advanced  to  the  Alai,  into  the  very 
heart  of  the  summer  pastures  of  the  Kara-Kirghese,  to  show  them  that 
after  the  Russian  occupation  they  could  no  longer  with  impunity  descend 
into  the  Ferghana  valley,  pillage  the  settlers,  and  retire  unhurt  to  their 
mountain  lands.  The  geographer  attached  to  this  expedition  was 
Captain  Kostenko,  who  not  only  crossed  the  Kyzyl-Su,  but  penetrated 
to  Lakes  Kara-Kul  and  Riang-Kul.  The  appearance  of  the  Trans-Alai 
mountains  he  describes  as  that  of  an  immense  white-crested  wall,  limit- 
ing  the  Pamir  on  the  north.  South  of  this  range  extends  a  high  table- 
land, rising  towards  the  centre,  and  intersected  in  all  directions  by 
mountain  ranges,  some  of  which  are  snow-capped  and  some  not,  but, 
generally  speaking,  having  only  a  small  elevation  above  the  adjoining 
valleys  and  plains.  The  valleys  as  well  as  the  mountain  slopes  are  bare- 
Only  small  strips  of  pasture  occur  along  the  mountain  streams,  affording 
food  for  the  cattle  of  the  nomads.  The  mountains  are  formed  of  soft 
rocks,  and  the  passes  are  comparatively  low.  Generally  speaking,  the 
roads  on  the  Pamir  are  easy  in  all  parts,  the  ground  being  sandy-stony, 
argillaceous,  sandy-salinous,  or  simply  salinous.  In  those  parts  where 
the  saline  pools  have  become  dry,  the  ground  is  covered  with  a  thick 
layer  of  magnesia,  glittering  like  snow.  The  severity  of  the  climate  is 
the  greatest  discomfort  to  man  on  the  Pamir.  The  thermometer  has 
been  known  to  register  in  the  shade,  says  R6clus,  18*  below  freezing 
point,  whilst  in  the  sun  it  rose  to  158*",  the  traveller  who  manipulated  the 
instrument  needing  to  protect  his  hand  from  scorching  in  the  sun's  glare. 
The  rareness  of  the  atmosphere  is  also  a  source  of  discomfort,  but  its 
alleged  injurious  effects  are  said  by  Kostenko  to  be  somewhat  exagge- 
rated. The  country  is  roamed  over  by  the  Kara-Kirghese,  who  appear 
to  have  given  Skobeleff  little  opportunity  for  slaughter.    The  scientific

of  country  from  its  natural  sterility.  The  only  other 
river  in  the  province  calling  for  mention  is  the  Kyzyl- 
Su,  which  takes  its  rise  at  the  very  top  of  the  water- 
shed, 10,000  feet  high,  whence  flow  streams  down 
one  of  its  slopes  into  the  Oxus,  and  down  the  other 
into  Western  Mongolia  at  Lob- Nor. 

The  lakes  of  the  province  are  few  in  number.  One 
in  the  valley,  centrally  situated,  is  the  Dam-Kul,  about 
14  miles  long  and  rather  less  than  half  as  broad.  In 
the  southern  hills,  near  Shakhimardan,  M.  Ujfalvy 
visited  the  Lake  Kutban-Kul  in  a  valley  covered  with 
immense  blocks  of  stone,  piled  on  one  another  as  if 
by    art.     He   describes    the    water   as   dark-green    in 

results  of  the  expedition  were  seen  in  the  first  charts  ever  made  of  the 
Alai  and  Trans-Alai  mountains,  and  the  northern  part  of  the  Pamir, 
the  march  route  maps  being  based  on  well-determined  points. 

A  third  expedition,  this  time  a  scientific  one,  under  the  command  of 
M.  M.  N.  Severtsoff,  was  sent  in  1877  and  1878  to  the  Pamir,  for  its 
exploration  and  geographical  description,  and  for  the  investigation  of 
its  geological  relations  to  the  Thian  Shan  range.     The  Kaufmann  Peak 
was  determined  to  be  22,800  feet  high,  and  the  three-peaked  mountain, 
Gurumdy,  to  the  east  of  it,  20,300  feet.     The  party  explored  not  only 
Kara-Kul,  but  the  smaller  lake,  Riang-Kul,  whence  a  good  view  is 
obtained  of  the  eastern  ranges  of  the  Pamir,  in  one  of  which  the  principal 
summit  rises  to  a  height  of  about  26,800  feet,  and  is  the  highest  peak  of 
the  **roof  of  the  world."     On  the  Ak-Su  river  Severtsoff  determined 
barometrically  the  lowest  elevation  recorded  in  the  Pamir — namely, 
12,000  feet,  and  not  far  distant  he  came  upon  his  first  willow  grove  in 
the  region,-  at  a  height  of  12,300  feet,  whilst  tamarisk  bushes  were  met 
with  on  the  river  up  to  13,200  feet.     In  some  of  the  swamps  were  found 
very  thick  deposits  of  peat,  and  amongst  the  marsh  plants  composing 
it  were  detected  several  northern  species,  the  same  as  occur  in  the 
neighbourhood  of  Petersburg.    In  fact,  the  vegetation  of  the  region  we 
are  considering  presents  an  exceedingly  unusual  combination  of  Alpine 
plants  with  those  of  the  northern  Tundras  and  the  South  Russian 
steppes.    In  this  flora  are  seen  East  Siberian,  Tibetan,  and  Mongolian 
species,  intermingled  with  those  of  Western  Siberia  and  the  Persian 
mountains.   In  addition  to  the  variety  of  plants  and  insects,  M.  Severt- 
soff found  the  Pamir  rich  in  vertebrates ;  he  met  with  more  than  20 
species  of  mammalia,  about   120  species  of  birds,  6  of  fishes,  and 
2  species  of  amphibia,  in  swamps  12,700  feet  high.

appearance,  calm  and  tranquil,  surrounded  on  the  north 
and  east  by  the  aforesaid  blocks,  and  on  the  other 
sides  by  mountains,  rising  abruptly  and  covered  with 
perpetual  snow.  Six  years  previously  to  the  visit  of 
M.  Ujfalvy  this  lake  had  been  discovered  to  science 
by  M.  Fedchenko,  after  whom  the  French  traveller 
desired  to  call  it  Lake  Fedchenko.  The  water  is  good 
to  the  taste,  and  in  it  fresh-water  trout  are  found. 
The  Kara-Kul  is,  however,  the  most  remarkable  in 
the  province,  if  not  also  the  largest  on  the  Pamir. 
The  approach  thereto  from  the  north  is  very  pic- 
turesque, surrounded  as  it  is  on  all  sides  by  snowy 
mountains,  some  of  which  have  glaciers.* 

I  have  already  alluded  to  the  great  variations  of 
temperature  in  the  climate  of  this  elevated  portion  of 
Ferghana.  I  may  add  that  in  this  same  region  the 
winds  are  sometimes  so  terribly  violent  as  to  take  away 
the  breath,  driving  before  them  snow,  dust,  and  sand, 
and  causing  the  flocks  to  press  together  for  safety. 
The  air  in  this  locality  is  in  general  very  dry,  and  of  a 

•  The  lake,  at  a  height  of  12,800  feet,  is  divided  into  two  basins, 
joined  by  a  narrow  strait,  and  the  beauty  of  the  scenery  is  heightened 
by  the  peculiar  shape  of  the  mountains,  the  dark  blue  appearance  of  the 
lake  waters,  and  the  general  tint  of  colour  pervading  the  whole  locality, 
notwithstanding  the  comparative  scantiness  of  vegetation.  There  are 
not  wanting  tokens  to  show  that  the  Kara-Kul,  now  extending  over  1 15 
square  miles,  was  at  one  time  much  larger.  The  water  now  brought  to 
the  lake  by  streams  is  insufficient  to  compensate  for  evaporation.  Rain 
is  very  rare,  and  the  precipitation  is  nearly  always  in  the  form  of  hail  or 
snow.  Before  Kostenko's  visit  maps  represented  the  Kara-Kul  as  send- 
ing off  its  waters  either  to  the  Oxus  or  to  the  river  of  Kashgar,  or  both, 
from  which  last,  according  to  R6clus,  it  received  from  the  Chinese  the 
appellation  of  the  Dragon  Lake,  as  if  they  would  compare  it  to  a  monster 
with  two  heads.  It  is  doubtful,  however,  if  it  ever  gave  off  water  in 
the  direction  of  Kashgar,  though  in  times  of  flood  it  has  not  quite 
ceased  to  overflow  towards  the  Oxus.  As  a  stream  rarely  runs  out  of 
the  Kara-Kul,  evaporation  has  rendered  the  waters  saline  ;  magnesian 
salts  making  them  so  bitter  that  animals  drink  them  unwillingly,  though

singular  transparency,  except  when  the  dust  storms  are 
brought  up  by  the  wind  from  the  desert.  These  dry 
clouds  are  a  common  phenomenon  on  the  Pamir  and 
in  Khokand,  where  Fedchenko  describes  them  thus : 
*'  The  atmospheric  suction  into  the  Ferghana  hollow 
is  so  strong  (through  the  Khojend  opening)  that  it 
frequently  draws  in  the  heated  air  generated  in  the 
neighbouring  sandy  deserts.  A  wind  called  Gharm-sol 
then  blows  at  Khojend  and  Khokand,  that  kills  the 
silkworm."  This  wind  blows  frequently  at  the  town 
of  Khokand.  The  sun  at  such  times  appears  like  a 
large  dull  disc,  without  brightness.  The  dimness  is 
produced  from  the  air  being  laden  with  fine  dust, 
which  penetrates  everywhere  and  carpets  the  ground.* 

The  Ferghana  winds,  however,  are  not  without 
their  advantages.  They  are,  it  is  true,  often  strong 
and  gusty,  sometimes  breaking  in  doors  and  lifting  the 
roofs  of  houses,  but  they  also  scatter  the  miasma  that 
rises  from  the  heaps  of  filth  in  the  inhabited  parts  of 
the  valley,  especially  in  populous  Khokand.  The 
temperature  of  the  Ferghana  hollow  is  of  course  very 

they  are  always  clear ;  and,  judging  from  the  manner  in  which  falcons 
and  other  birds  of  prey  plunge  into  them,  the  lake  must  contain  fish. 
According  to  the  nomads,  the  surface  of  the  Kara-Kul  rises  regularly 
on  Friday,  which  odd  phenomenon,  R^clus  says,  could  be  accounted 
for  only  by  the  action  of  some  powerful  intermittent  source.  Kostenko 
and  Korostovtzef  both  speak  of  the  periodicity  of  the  risings  of  the 
Kara-Kul,  but  do  not  indicate  their  duration  or  extent. 

*  The  hot  winds  on  the  Oxus  at  Hissar  and  at  Khiva  are  called 
Ttbbad,  The  same  phenomenon  in  Yarkand,  according  to  Mr.  R. 
Michell,  is  described  by  Danibeg  (1795),  who  says  in  reference  to  it: 
**  An  inexplicable  dust,  coming  no  one  knows  from  where,  faUs  like 
rain,  and  renders  the  autumn  unbearable.  The  dust  is  so  dense  that 
the  sun's  rays  cannot  penetrate  it,  and  this  sometimes  continues  seven  or 
eight  days.**  Mr.  R.  Michell  adds,  quoting  Rennell's  **  Herodotus '' :  "It 
was  perhaps  the  prevalence  of  these  mists  that  gave  rise  to  the  expres* 
sion  *  Cimmerian  darkness,'  Scythia  being  anciently  called  Cimmeria."

different  from  that  of  the  Pamir.  In  the  lowest  zone 
the  climate  is  tropical,  in  the  middle  it  is  temperate, 
and  in  the  highest  bracing.* 

As  regards  the  geology  of  the  province  the  rocks  of 
the  Alai  under  the  clay  and  sand  of  the  surface  are 
spoken  of  by  R6clus,  quoting  Mouchketoff,  as  com- 
posed of  granite  and  crystalline  schists. t 

The  Ferghana  mountains  are  rich  in  minerals,  such 
as  iron,  lead,  coal,  rock-crystal,  amethyst,  and  other 
varieties  of  quartz,  silver,  mica,  turquoise,  sulphur,  and 
naphtha,  some  of  which  are  as  yet  known  in  no  other 
part  of  Russian  Turkistan.  \ 

Ferghana,  however,  is  less  remarkable  for  its 
mineral  than  its  vegetable  products,  which  var)%  of 
course,    according    to    the    different   belts   or    zones 

*  The  heat  at  Marghilan  goes  up  in  summer  in  the  shade  to  104**. 
Osh  has  a  more  temperate  climate  than  Marghilan,  and  a  delicious 
temperature,  the  heat  rising  in  July,  1877,  to  ']'f.  It  rains  there  in 
summer,  and  the  Gharm-sol }\xst  spoken  of  is  unknown.  In  winter  both 
these  places  are  subject  to  cold,  which  often  goes  down  to  5*,  and  in 
exceptional  seasons  to  even  —  7*  or  —  13'. 

t  The  masses  of  granite,  which  without  doubt  would  be  seen  to  form 
the  deposit  if  the  plateau  were  gashed  by  torrents,  are  superimposed 
in  the  same  manner  as  the  principal  chains  of  the  Thian  Shan.  Down 
towards  the  Khokand  valley,  near  the  sources  of  the  Isfara,  Fedchenko 
speaks  of  the  mountains  as  of  conglomerate,  tertiary  clays,  and 
gypsum,  and  adds  that  a  great  quantity  of  alabaster  is  there  quarried 
for  use  in  Khokand.  In  a  grotto  near  ArasAne  are  found  stalactites 
and  stalagmites,  and  in  the  district  of  Andijan  there  are  sulphur 
springs  of  100°  temperature. 

X  The  only  deposit  of  turquoise  is  found  in  Mount  Karamazar,  about 
24  miles  north-east  of  Khojend,  in  the  valley  of  Biriouza-Sai.  The 
adjacent  mountains  are  composed  of  felspar  porphyry,  with  veins  of 
diabase.  By  decomposition  the  porphyry  has  become  converted 
into  argillaceous  matter,  traversed  by  numerous  veins  of  ferruginous 
quartz.  It  is  in  these  decomposed  rocks  that  the  turquoise  is  met  with, 
either  in  the  clefts  of  the  quartz,  or  in  those  of  the  argillaceous 
porphyry,  under  the  form  of  layers  and  small  veins,  of  which  the 
thickness  attains  from  '08  to  '12  inch,  and  isolated  deposits  from 
'8  to  1*2  inch  in  diameter.    Judging  from  the  former  workings  and  the

already  described.  The  lands  near  the  Syr  are  covered 
with  tall  herbs,  often  in  patches,  and  with  brambles. 
In  the  plains  are  poplars,  willows,  plane-trees,  and 
karagaches  ;  fruit-trees  of  all  kinds,  1 6  sorts  of  grapes, 
and  delicious  melons  of  all  sizes.  Besides  the  usual 
cereals,  they  cultivate  rice,  maize,  cotton,  jugara,  and 
lucerne  of  splendid  growth.  The  jugara  attains  a 
height  sufficient  to  form  a  hiding-place  for  men  on 
horseback.  The  third  and  stony  zone  produces  some 
unimportant  gramineous  plants,  and  here  and  there 
brambles  and  bushes.  In  the  temperate  zone  one 
sees  what  may  be  called  meadows,  in  the  European 
sense  of  the  word.  The  higher  zones  have  vegetation 
of  an  Alpine  character,  and  sometimes  pine  forests. 

extent  of  decomposed  porphyry,  this  deposit  is  rather  important,  and 
deserves  attention.  It  would  be  easy  to  make  a  road  nearly  up  to  the 
locality  where  mineral  is  found  ;  but  amongst  the  drawbacks  must  be 
mentioned  scarcity  of  water,  and  entire  lack  of  wood. 

Petroleum  again  is  confined  apparently  to  Ferghana.  In  the  moun- 
tains, at  several  spots,  it  appears  on  the  surface  mixed  with  the  water. 
There  are  known  at  least  six  springs  in  the  province,  all  of  them  situated 
from  &00  to  1,200  yards  above  the  sea  level.  The  localities  where  the 
petroleum  springs  have  been  found  are  completely  bare  of  forests,  and 
often  lack  water,  though  the  road  thither  may  be  practicable.  The 
quantity  of  petroleum  coming  to  the  surface  daily  from  any  one  spring, 
as  At  Maila,  does  not  exceed  50  gallons  ;  but,  if  wells  were  bored,  this 
quantity  might  be  greatly  multiplied.  The  petroleum  proceeds  exclu- 
sively from  beds  of  cretaceous  formation  composed  of  very  fossiliferous 
sandy  limestone,  red  grit,  green  clays,  gypsum,  and  marl.  Most 
frequently  the  petroleum  runs  in  the  limestone,  or  lower,  in  contact 
with  limestone  and  gypsum.  As  one  meets  sometimes  with  salt  crystals 
in  the  clay,  the  water  which  brings  the  petroleum  is  nearly  always 
salt.  The  more  the  petroleum  beds  are  disturbed,  the  more  abundant 
are  the  sources,  and  vice  versd.  Near  the  springs  are  seen  deposits  of 
petroleum  solidified,  that  bears  the  name  of  kire.  Considering  the 
vast  extent  of  Ferghana  territory  over  which  petroleum  is  found,  and  the 
sparsity  of  population  in  the  localities,  Mouchketoflf  thinks  that,  without 
doubt,  many  more  springs  might  be  discovered.  A  third  Turkistan 
mineral,  of  which  the  only  deposit  that  merits  attention  is  in  Ferghana, 
is  native  sulphur.  It  is  found  28  miles  to  the  south-south-east  of 
Khokand,  in  the  Ir-Jaga  ravine  of  the  valley  of  Char-Su. 


THE  PROVINCE  OF  FERGHANA,  499 

On  the  mulberry  trees  of  Ferghana  are  raised  the 
most  valuable  silkworms  of  Central  Asia,  and  good 
tobacco  is  grown  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Namangan.* 

The  fauna  of  Ferghana  is  better  known  to  us  than 
of  any  other  part  of  Russian  Turkistan,  thanks  to  the 
labours  of  M.  Fedchenko,  who  travelled  round  the 
province  as  a  naturalist,  and  who  made  a  collection 
of  specimens  that  have  been  described  in  what  I  may 
call  the  great  classical  work  upon  Turkistan  fauna. f 
It  may  suffice  for  the  present  to  say  that  the  domestic 
animals  of  Ferghana  profit  by  the  advantages  of  the 
climate,  and  are  robust  and  well  grown.  The  oxen 
are  strong,  and  the  cows  give  excellent  milk,  that  of 
the  Kirghese  cows  having,  according  to  M.  Ujfalvy, 
a  perfumed  taste.  Along  the  Kara-daria  aquatic  birds 
are  numerous,  especially  the  Cormorant,  the  Ibis,  and 
a  long-legged  bird  of  the  order  GrallcBy  resembling  the 
Flamingo.  In  the  mountains  Porcupines  are  common, 
as  also  the  Maral,  and,  in  the  streams  running  into  the 
Kyzyl-Su,  Fedchenko  discovered  a  species  of  Trout 
unknown  in  any  river  of  the  Turkistan  plains. 

As  in  other  provinces  of  the  country,  the  position 
of  the  Ferghana  towns  has  been  determined  by  the 

*  M.  Pervushin,  who,  in  1869,  made  sundry  experiments  with 
American,  Turkish,  and  Dutch  varieties,  was  af  opinion  that  the  best 
sorts  of  tobacco  might  be  grown  in  Turkistan  as  well  as  in  Southern 
Europe,  whence  they  are  now  imported  into  Russia.  As  the  result  of 
his  experiments,  he  stated  that  an  acre  of  land  yielded  480  lbs.  of 
tobacco,  which  at  Moscow  was  valued  at  13^.  per  lb.  From  the  gross 
return  of;^70  for  an  acre  must  be  deducted  for  expenses  in  preparing 
and  watching  the  plantation  £^2 — namely,  ;^  19  for  the  wages  of  3  men 
employed  for  160  days  at  \od,\  £2  los,  for  rent ;  and  carriage  to  Moscow 
at  19J.  per  cwt. ;  leaving  a  profit  per  acre  of  about  ^^50.  In  1870  M. 
Pervushin  repeated  the  experiment,  and  planted  12  acres  with  results 
equally  satisfactory.  After  transplantation  the  tobacco  grew  thickly 
and  rapidly,  and  in  the  middle  of  August  was  ready  for  gathering.

rivers.  The  banks  of  the  Upper  Naryn  have  on 
them  only  a  few  Cossack  stations ;  but  north  of  the 
confluence  of  this  river  with  the  Kara-daria  is  built 
the  town  of  Namangan,  with  native  manufactories  of 
cotton  stuffs,  i,ooo  shops,  and  an  annual  sale  of 
300,000  sheep.  Here  they  construct  rafts,  which, 
laden  with  fruits,  skins,  and  felts,  are  floated  down  the 
Syr.  North-west  of  Namangan  is  Kassan,  boasting 
of  being  the  most  ancient  town  in  Ferghana,  the  Tajik 
inhabitants  of  which  M.  Ujfalvy  pronounced  the  most 
handsome  in  Turkistan. 

Chust  is  another  town  north  of  the  Syr-daria,  where 
they  make  knives,  as  famous  in  their  way  as  those 
of  Hissar.  The  waters  of  the  Kara-daria  lave  several 
towns,  beginning  with  Uzgend,  situated,  at  a  height  of 
3,200  feet,  at  the  mouth  of  one  of  the  defiles  of  the 
Thian  Shan.  This  town  has  become  famous  by  reason 
of  a  neighbouring  tomb,  whither  pilgrimages  are  made 
in  memory  of  Hoja  Yusuf  South  of  Uzgend,  but 
2,000  feet  higher,  is  the  fortified  town  of  Gulcha, 
defending  from  the  Chinese  the  Terek-davan  Pass. 
The  principal  town  of  East  Ferghana  is  Andijan, 
watered  by  canals  from  the  Kara-daria,  and  to  the 
north-east  of  this  are  the  thermal  carbonated  and 
sulphurous  waters  of  Djalabad-Ayup,  much  frequented 
by  the  natives. 

Osh,  to  the  south-east  of  Andijan,  upon  the  River 
Ak-Bura,  is  at  the  mouth  of  the  valley  by  which  one 
mounts  to  the  Alai  and  the  Pamir.  The  town  com- 
mands a  magnificent  view,  but  the  most  interesting 
object  is  an  isolated  rock  called  Takht-i-Suleiman, 
or  the  Throne  of  Solomon,  spoken  of  in  conflicting 
Oriental  legends.*     To  the  west  of  the  Ak-Bura  are

found  several  important  towns  in  the  Ferghana  valley, 
such  as  Naukat  and  Aravan.  Marghilan  is  situated  on 
the  River  Shakhimardan,  and  by  reason  of  its  salubrity 
a  spot  near  has  been  chosen  by  the  Russian  authorities 
for  the  site  of  the  new  capital  of  the  province.  Accord- 
ing to  local  tradition,  the  **  two-horned  Alexander  of 
Macedon,"  whom  they  speak  of  as  one  of  the  saints 
of  Islam  (!),  died  here,  and  the  place  is  accordingly 
regarded  as  sacred.  South  of  Marghilan,  higher  up  the 
river,  is  the  town  of  Shakhimardan,  or  **king  of  men," 
which  claims  to  have  in  possession  (as  do  other  places 
in  Muhammadan  countries)  the  tomb  of  the  prophet 
Ali,  and  is,  consequently,  one  of  the  most  famous 
resorts  of  Ferghana  pilgrims.  There  are  other  popu- 
lated places  in  the  pretty  valley  of  the  Isfara,  and 
among  them  a  town  of  this  name,  numbering  5,000 
inhabitants.  I  am  not  aware  that  any  census  has  been 
taken,  but  of  the  towns  I  have  named  Khokand  is  said 
to  possess  60,000  inhabitants,  Namangan  50,000,  and 
Marghilan  40,000,  whilst  Andijan  and  Osh  are  put  down 
at  20,000  each,  and  the  whole  province  at  729,690. 
For  purposes  of  administration,  Ferghana  is  divided 
into  seven  districts,  of  which  that  of  Andijan  is  the 
largest,  and  Marghilan  the  most  important.

of  his  black  dogs.  There  they  drank  his  blood  and  ate  his  body.  Into

THE  Khokand  or  Ferghana  valley  in  the  four- 
teenth century  formed  part  of  the  great  empire 
of  Tamerlane,  whose  descendant  in  the  fifth  generation, 
Zahir-ud-din  Baber,  was  born  in  its  ancient  capital  of 
Andijan,  and  subsequently  ruled  the  country  as  an 
appanage  to  the  throne  of  Samarkand.  It  was  wrested 
from  him  in  1504,  when,  quitting  his  native  land,  he 
fled  to  India,  leaving  behind,  it  was  supposed,  in  the 
flight  of  his  harem,  a  child  wrapped  in  brocades,  who, 
being  found  in  the  Khokand  deserts,  was  named  Altyn 
Beshik,  or  golden  cradle,  and  subsequently  made 
sovereign,  but  over  how  much  territory  is  uncertain. 
Altyn  Beshik  was  followed,  according  to  Sodi  Hukm 
Singh,   by  a  line   of  eight  rulers*  ;  yet  both  popular 

•  Tungriyar ;  Muhammad  Amin  Bi ;  Abd-ul  Kasim  Bi ;  Ubaid-ulla 
Bi ;  Shahmast  Bi,  alias  Chamash  Bi ;  Haji  Khari ;  Ashur  Kul ;  and 
Shahrukh  Rek  (or  Atolyk).

tradition  and  the  Chinese  accounts  agree,  says  Dr. 
Schuyler,  that  in  the  middle  of  the  last  century  Kho- 
kand  was  not  under  one  sovereign,  but  was  divided 
into  separate  provinces,  cities,  and  clans,  each  with  its 
own  Bek  or  Khoja.*  According  to  Mahsum  Khoja  s 
account,  Shahrukh,  the  eighth  ruler,  went  from  the 
Volga  region  to  Ferghana,  married  the  daughter  of 
Ediger  Khoja,  murdered  his  father-in-law,  and  then 
became  ruler  in  Ediger's  stead.  He  was  succeeded 
by  Abd-ul  Karim  Bi,  who  built  the  present  city  of 
Khokand,  and  transferred  thither  his  residence.  Next 
followed  Abdur  Rahman  Bi,  his  brother,  and  then 
Yardana,  Irdana,  or  Erdeni,  Bi,  to  whom,  the  great 
Chinese  geographer  says,  all  the  other  towns  of 
Ferghana  were  subject. 

It  was  in  the  time  of  Erdeni  that  Khokand  appears 
to  have  come  under  Chinese  influence,  for  when,  in 
1 759,  the  general,  Tchao-hoei,  despatched  some  officers 
to  put  down  the  Buruts,  Erdeni  entertained  the 
officers  at  Khokand,  and  subsequently  sent  in  his 
submission  to  the  Emperor  Khian-lung.  This  was 
about  the  time  that  the  Chinese  exterminated  the 
Sungarian  Kalmuks.  Tashkend  had  yielded  to  China 
in  1758,  and  after  Erdeni's  submission,  the  Beks  of 
Andijan  and  Marghilan  followed  suit,  and  in  1760  sent 
with  their  tribute  to  Peking  "  horses  that  sweat  blood," 
great  eagles  and  falcons  for  hunting,  and  **  plates  of  the 

•  In  addition  to  the  able  sketch  of  the  history  of  Khokand  in  Dr. 
Schuyler's  Appendix,  I  have  consulted  two  small  works  upon  the  sub- 
ject, compiled  subsequently  to  his,  by  Alexander  von  Kuhn,  and  Sodi 
Hukm  Singh.  The  latter  professes  to  have  derived  his  chief  information 
from  *'  a  most  reliable  and  intelligent  observer  of  the  Khokand  State, 
where  he  had  every  facility  of  observation  **  ;  and  since  there  is  such  a 
paucity  of  Asiatic  writers  upon  the  subject,  I  have  frequently  quoted 
Singh,  and  sometimes  given  him  preference  where  statements  conflict.

fountain  of  the  dragon."     Erdeni  died  in  1770  without 
male  issue,  and  was  succeeded  by  Narbuta,  his  nephew. 

Narbuta  was  a  man  of  war  from  his  youth.  He 
added  to  his  dominions  Andijan,  Namangan,  and  Ush, 
and  laid  the  foundation  of  Khokandian  influence  in 
Eastern  Turkistan,  whilst  in  his  latter  days  he  tried  to 
wrest  Khojend  from  the  ruler  of  Ura-Tiube.  He  made 
an  alliance  with  the  Emir  of  Bokhara,  and  fought 
against  Ura-Tiube,  but  was  beaten.  He  was  also 
defeated  when  undertaking  an  expedition  in  1779 
against  Tashkend,  shortly  after  which  he  was  be- 
headed, according  to  some,  in  1780,  or  died,  according 
to  others,  in  1806.  Narbuta  left  three  sons.  The 
eldest  two  were  Alim  and  Omar,  each  of  whom  in 
succession  reigned  four  years.  In  the  reign  of  Alim, 
Khojend,  Ura-Tiube,  and  Tashkend  were  all  added  to 
Khokand,  and  various  forays  were  made  further  north 
against  the  Kirghese.  Alim,  moreover,  is  said  to 
have  been  the  first  who  gave  himself  the  title  of  Khan, 
who  ordered  his  name  to  be  recited  in  the  Khulbe,  or 
daily  prayers,  and  who  coined  money.*  In  the  reign  of 
his  brother  Omar,  the  town  of  Turkistan  and  several 
others  to  the  north  were  conquered,  and  the  last 
descendant  of  the  Kirghese  rulers,  Tozai  Khan,  was 
forced  to  seek  refuge  in  Bokhara. 

In  1 82 1  Omar  Khan  died,  or  was  poisoned  by  his 
son  Muhammad  Ali,  who  then  became  Khan,  and 
reigned  for  20  years,  his  name  being  contracted  to 
Madali.  Madali  exiled  some  of  his  relatives,  one 
going  to  Bokhara,  the  Emir  of  which  country  quarrelled 
with  Madali  in  1825,  though  the  quarrel  was  patched 
up,   and  the  Khan  was  free  to  try  his  arms  in  Kash-

garia,  whither  he  turned  to  aid  Jihangyr  Khoja,  whose 
ancestors  had  been  driven  from  the  throne  of  Kashgar 
by  the  Chinese  in  1756.  Madali  and  Jihangyr  were 
temporarily  victorious,  but  a  Chinese  army  of  70,000 
men  came  and  drove  back  Madali  and  the  Khokan- 
dians,  taking  away  Jihangyr  to  be  executed  at  Peking. 
The  next  year,  1828,  a  brother  of  Jihangyr  tried  to 
obtain  possession  of  Kashgar,  and  again  Madali  helped. 
Kashgar,  Yangi-Hissar,  and  Yarkand  were  all  taken, 
and,  on  the  approach  of  another  Chinese  army,  the 
Khokandians  again  withdrew  with  their  booty — a  pro- 
cess that  so  sickened  the  Chinese  that  they  determined 
to  buy  peace  and  quiet  of  the  Khokandians,  and  con- 
cluded a  treaty  at  Peking  in  1831,  whereby  Khokand 
was  to  receive  duties  on  foreign  goods  imported  into 
Kashgaria,  and  was  allowed  to  maintain  representa- 
tives in  various  towns  to  collect  them.  This,  of 
course,  gave  Khokand  influence  over  Kashgaria,  so 
that  subsequently  Madali  conquered  Karategin,  and 
forced  Kulab,  Darwaz,  and  Shignan  on  his  southern 
border,  to  recognize  his  authority.  It  was  about  this 
time  (1835)  that  the  first  official  intercourse  took  place 
between  Khokand  and  Russia.  The  Tsar  having 
requested  the  Khan  to  promote  trade  between  the  two 
states,  by  protecting  Russian  subjects,  Madali  sent  his 
spiritual  guide  {^pir)  to  Petersburg,  to  give  assurances 
of  future  security  and  to  profess  friendship.  Six  years 
later  the  Khan  hospitably  entertained  the  English 
captain,  Arthur  Conolly,  sent  to  him  in  1841  by  the 
British  Government  from  India. 

Madali's  career,  brilliant  as  in  some  respects  it  had 
been,  was,  however,  coming  to  an  end.  From  a  warrior 
he  sunk  to  a  sensualist,  having  already  incurred  much 
unpopularity  by  his  marriage  with  two  sisters  and  his

father  s  widow.  Nasr-Ullah,  the  Emir  of  Bokhara,  his 
hereditary  and  powerful  foe,  who,  in  pursuit  of  his 
claim  to  the  Khanate,  had  twice  vainly  attempted  to 
subdue  Khokand,  now  sent  a  letter  to  the  Khan,  accus- 
ing him  of  breaking  the  Muhammadan  law;  whereupon 
the  enraged  Madali  imprisoned  and  half-shaved  the 
bearers  of  the  letter,  and  made  ready  for  war,  the  end 
of  which  was  that  Madali  was  beaten,  and  by  order  of 
the  Emir  executed  in  1841.  The  step-mother,  fated  to 
be  spouse  of  three  sovereigns,  was  taken  to  wife  next 
by  Nasr-Ullah,  and  the  other  wives  of  Madali  Khan, 
forty  cartloads  of  them,  were  also  taken  to  Bokhara. 

The  Emir  now  reasserted  his  old  pretensions  to  the 
Khanate,  declared  that  the  territory  belonged  to  him, 
and  appointed  as  governor  Ibrahim,  who,  before  three 
months  had  expired,  so  oppressed  the  people  as  to 
drive  them  into  a  general  insurrection,  from  which  he 
had  to  flee  into  Bokhara,  and  the  Khokandians  placed 
on  their  throne,  as  Madali's  successor,  the  aged  Shir 
Ali,  a  nephew  of  Narbuta.  The  Emir,  enraged  at 
Ibrahim's  loss,  set  out  to  regain  the  Khanate  with 
20,000  men  and  250  Khokandian  hostages,  thinking 
that  the  Kipchaks,  by  whose  bravery  Shir  Ali  had 
been  set  on  the  throne,  would  flee  at  his  approach. 

Among  the  hostages,  however,  was  a  brave  and 
popular  Kipchak,  called  Mussulman  Kul,  who  had 
been  an  officer  in  Khokand.  He  flattered  the  Emir 
that  he  could  obtain  for  him  possession  of  the  city,  and 
he  was  accordingly  allowed  to  enter.  Instead  of  this 
he  preached  "  No  surrender,"  and  contrived  so  to 
outwit  the  Emir,  that,  after  a  siege  of  forty  days,  the 
Bokhariots  returned  to  their  own  land.  Mussulman 
Kul  now  became  king-maker  in  Khokand.  Shir  AH 
was  simple,  good-natured,  and  weak,  and  his  reign  of 


AN  EPITOME  OF  KHOKAND  HISTORY.  507 

three  years  was  marked  by  struggles  for  supremacy 
between  the  Kipchaks  or  nomads  and  the  Sarts  or 
townspeople.  The  Kipchaks,  having  placed  the  weak 
Shir  Ali  on  the  throne,  thought  that  their  chief  Yusuf 
should  govern  the  country.  But  the  head  of  the  Sart 
faction,  Shadi,  was  preferred  by  the  people,  and,  with 
the  consent  of  the  Khan,  poisoned  Yusuf,  and  sum- 
moned Mussulman  Kul  to  come  to  Khokand.  Mussul- 
man Kul  replied  politely  that  he  was  on  his  way,  but 
in  reality  he  gathered  an  army  as  he  came,  slew  Shadi, 
and  took  his  place  as  Mingbashi,  to  find  himself,  how- 
ever, between  two  fires — namely,  the  Sarts,  whom  he 
could  not  satisfy  with  sufficient  posts  of  honour,  and 
the  Kipchaks,  who  were  jealous  of  his  prominence. 

At  length  one  of  the  dissatisfied   parties  in    1845 
sent  deputies  to  a  son  of  the  late  Alim  Khan,  Sultan 
Murad  Bek,  who  was  living  in  the  Khanate  of  Bokhara, 
to  come  to  Khokand  and  take  possession  of  the  throne. 
Murad  easily  persuaded  the  Emir,  Nasr-Ullah,  to  help 
him,  and,  proceeding  to  Khokand  with  a  small  force, 
in  the  absence  of  Mussulman  Kul,  who  was  gone  to 
the  mountains  to  collect  tribute,  he  seized  the  capital, 
slew  Shir  Ali,  and  proclaimed  himself  at  once  Khan  of 
Khokand   and    vassal-lieutenant    of  the  Emir  of  Bo- 
khara.    Here  he  made  a  mistake,  for  the  Khokandians 
so  hated  the  Bokhariots,  that  word  was  immediately 
sent  to  Mussulman  Kul,  who  advanced  with  his  forces, 
stopping,  however,  on  his  way  at  Marghilan  to  take 
with  him  his  son-in-law,    Khudaiar,   who  was  one  of 
the  younger  sons  of  Shir  Ali.     As  soon  as  Murad 
heard  of  the  approach  of  Mussulman  Kul,  he  fled  from 
the  city,  after  a  reign  of  17  days,  in  1844,  and  left  the 
king-maker  to  take  possession. 
Shir  Ali    had  left  five  sons,    Sarymsak,   Khudaiar, 


508  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Sultan  Murad,  Malla,  and  Sufi.  Sarymsak  was  22 
years  of  age,  and  Bek  of  Tashkend,  to  whom  Mussul- 
man Kul  sent,  asking  him  to  become  Khan,  but 
caused  him  to  be  murdered  on  the  way,  after  which 
Khudaiar  was  proclaimed  Khan.  And  thus  came  on 
to  the  Khokandian  stage,  at  the  boyish  age  of  i6» 
the  Khan  whose  name  so  often  occurs  in  connection 
with  the  Russian  conquest,  and  who,  during  a  period 
of  31  years,  from  1844  to  1875,  was  thrice  raised 
to  sovereignty  and  thrice  deposed.  Khudaiar's  first 
occupation  of  the  throne  lasted  16  years.  During 
that  period  the  Kipchaks  were  in  the  ascendant.  The 
boy-Khan  was  kept  by  Mussulman  Kul,  his  father- 
in-law,  in  strict  seclusion,  from  all  the  affairs  of  state, 
and  allowed  but  little  money,  lest  he  should  acquire 
friends  by  giving  them  presents.  The  Regent  also 
removed  from  the  government  every  Sart  who  had 
been  hostile  to  him,  and  raised  up  enemies  for  himself, 
even  among  the  Kipchaks,  especially  Nur  Muhammad, 
Bek  of  Tashkend.  Khudaiar  chafed  under  the  tutelage 
of  his  father-in-law,  and  when,  in  1850,  he  reached 
his  majority,  he  was  ripe  for  taking  reprisals.  An 
opportunity  arrived  in  the  following  year,  1851,  when 
Nur  Muhammad  led  his  forces  towards  the  capital 
with  the  hope  of  overthrowing  Mussulman  Kul,  but 
his  purpose  was  defeated.  Later,  rebellion  having 
broken  out,  Mussulman  Kul  marched  against  the 
Tashkendians,  taking  with  him  the  Khan,  because  he 
did  not  dare  to  leave  him  in  Khokand.  Just  before 
the  decisive  battle,  it  was  found  that  Khudaiar  had 
stolen  away  at  night  and  joined  Nur  Muhammad, 
upon  which  Mussulman  Kul  did  not  lose  his  presence 
of  mind,  but  conquered  and  slew  Nur  Muhammad 
(so  at   least  says  von  Kuhn,  but  not  Schuyler),  and 


AN  EPITOME  OF  KHOKAND  HISTORY.  509 

took  the  young  Khan  prisoner.  The  Regent  and  Khan, 
however,  came  to  terms,  and  matters  returned  to  their 
old  footing  for  nearly  six  months,  when,  on  a  festive 
day  in  Khokand,  the  Sarts,  with  their  knives,  set  upon 
Mussulman  Kul  and  slew  his  followers,  though  he 
himself  escaped,  gathered  another  army,  and  marched 
against  Khokand.  This  time  he  was  not  successful, 
and  had  to  flee  once  more  to  the  Kipchaks,  who  now 
gave  him  up  to  the  Khan,  much  to  their  subsequent 
chagrin,  for  Khudaiar,  having  escaped  from  Kipchak 
tutelage  and  surrounded  himself  with  Sarts,  gave 
orders  that  the  Kipchaks  throughout  the  country  were 
to  be  slaughtered.  In  the  course  of  three  months, 
20,000  persons  it  is  said  were  killed,  Mussulman  Kul 
was  exposed  on  the  scaffold  for  three  days,  whilst 
600  innocent  Kipchaks  were  slaughtered  before  his 
eyes,  and  finally,  in  1853,  he  himself  was  hanged. 

The  ascendency  of  the  Sarts  was  now  inaugurated, 
and  Mirza  Akhmet  appointed  Bek  of  Tashkend ;  but 
he,  by  his  severity,  excited  great  discontent  among  the 
Kazaks  of  Chimkent  and  Aulie-Ata.  This  was  in 
1857,  when  the  KarLKirghese  and  the  remnant  of 
the  Kipchaks  entered  into  negotiations  with  Malla, 
or  Mulla,  Bek,  (an  elder  brother  of  the  Khan)  pro- 
claimed him  ruler,  and  marched  against  Khudaiar  in 
Khokand,  whereupon  Khudaiar  was  beaten,  and 
driven  to  take  refuge  in  Bokhara,  whilst  Malla  was 
received  as  Khan  in  1859. 

Malla  Khan  reigned  for  two  years,  and  had  for  his 
chief  adviser  Alim  Kul,  who  greatly  disappointed  the 
Kipchak  chiefs  by  not  giving  them  posts  in  the  govern- 
ment, whereupon  they  conspired  to  murder  the  Khan, 
and  proclaimed  in  his  place  Shah  Murad,  a  boy  of 
15    years,    nephew   of  Khudaiar.      They  would   also 


510  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

have  killed  a  son  of  Malta  Khan,  Seid  Sultan,  13 
years  old,  but  Alim  Kul  got  him  away  to  Andijan, 
though  he  feigned  submission  to  the  government  of 
Shah  Murad. 

Meanwhile  Khudaiar  had  received  a  welcome  at  the 
court  of  Bokhara,  and  Nasr-Ullah  permitted  him  first 
to  live  at   Samarkand ;   but  then,    changing   his  dis- 
position  towards   him,    Khudaiar    was   compelled    to 
retire  to  Jizakh,  where,  having  no  means  of  subsistence, 
he  took  to  trading,  and  supported  himself  as  a  carrier. 
From  Jizakh,  Khudaiar  was  recalled  by  turbulent  spirits 
at  Tashkend,  who  were  dissatisfied  with  the  govern- 
ment of  Shah  Murad,  and  with  their  help  he  overcame 
Alim  Kul,   put  Shah   Murad   to  death,   and  in    1862 
Khokand  received  back  its  old   tyrant  with  delight. 
But  there  were  now  two  parties  in  the  Khanate  ;  for 
Alim  Kul  proclaimed   Seid  Sultan  Khan,   and  began 
decisive  operations  against  Khudaiar,  who  applied  for 
assistance  to  the  new   Emir  of  Bokhara.      Mozaffar- 
Eddin,    son   of  Nasr-Ullah,  came   in   person   with   a 
large  army  and  drove   Alim  Kul   into  the  defiles  of 
Kara-Kuldja,    whence    he    would    not   be    dislodged, 
whereupon  the   Emir  got  angry  with   Khudaiar,  and 
returned  to  Bokhara  in  1863,  whither  Khudaiar  was 
obliged   to    follow   his   patron,    whilst    Alim   Kul,    as 
supreme   ruler,   and    Seid    Sultan  as    Khan,   entered 
Khokand.      Matters  continued  thus  for   three  years, 
Alim  Kul  fighting  the  Russians,  and  losing  in  succes- 
sion   Aulie-Ata,   Turkistan,    and    Chimkent.     At  the 
same  time  he  roused  against  himself  the  inhabitants 
of  Khokand  by  his  rough  severity.     For  a  time  he 
maintained    comparative   quiet,    but    soon   met    with 
discontent,  and  petitions  went  out  from  every  city  to 
Khudaiar  to  return. 


AN  EPITOME  OF  KHOKAND  HISTORY.  511 

Khudaiar  was  once  more  rusticating  at  Jizakh, 
carrying  on  mercantile  operations,  but  this  time  on 
a  larger  scale.  He  again  persuaded  the  Emir  of 
Bokhara  to  render  assistance,  and  preparations  were 
being  made,  when  news  arrived  that  Alim  Kul  had 
been  killed  in  fighting  near  Tashkend.  Upon  this 
the  young  Seid  Muhammad  Khan,  with  some  of  his 
chiefs,  fled  to  the  city  (whence  he  was  conveyed  to 
Bokhara,  and  ultimately,  in  1871,  murdered  by 
Khudaiar),  whilst  others  of  the  chiefs  fled  to  Kho- 
kand,  and  raised  to  the  throne  Khudai  Kul,  on  8th 
June,  1865.  He  reigned  till  the  nth  July,  when, 
with  the  help  of  the  Bokhariots,  Khudaiar  for  the 
third  time  was  raised  to  be  Khan,  the  Emir  claiming 
Khojend  and  Ura-Tiube  as  the  price  of  his  services. 

Khudaiar  might  now  have  reigned  in  peace  had  he 
conducted  his  home  affairs  with  the  prudence  he 
showed  towards  the  Russian  invaders  ;  for  he  avoided 
the  wrath  of  the  Governor-General,  which  fell  on  the 
head  of  the  Emir,  and  seeing  that  he  could  not  dream 
of  regaining  the  part  of  Khokand  the  Russians  had 
taken,  he  accepted  the  inevitable,  and  asked  for  a 
treaty,  that  was  concluded  in  1868,  between  him  and 
the  Governor-General  of  Turkistan,  the  result  of 
which  was  greatly  to  strengthen  Khudaiar's  power 
over  his  subjects.  Unfortunately,  however,  Khudaiar 
and  his  councillors  were  bent  upon  little  else  than 
their  own  aggrandisement,  and  they  shrank  from  no 
means  of  gaining  it.  Taxes,  unjustly  imposed,  in- 
creased year  by  year,  and  the  hatred  of  the  people 
against  their  Khan  increased  accordingly.  In  vain 
the  Governor-General  warned  Khudaiar,  bidding  him 
reform  his  administration. 

In    187 1    a  revolt  broke  out,   but  was  terminated. 


512  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Two  years  later  a  more  serious  movement  began,  in 
consequence  of  the  Khari  wishing  to  impose  additional 
taxes  on  the  Kara-Kirghese.  This  revolt  also  was 
quelled,  but  by  the  beginning  of  1874  the  general 
feelings  of  the  Kipchaks  and  Kirghese  were  turned 
against  Khudaiar,  and  the  insurgents  proposed  to 
Nasir-ud-din,  son  of  Khudaiar,  that  he  should  reign 
over  them,  and  lead  them  to  fight  the  **  infidels,"  with 
whom  his  father  had  entered  into  alliance. 

Nasir-ud-din  agreed  to  the  silly  proposal,  whereupon 
a  general  insurrection  broke  out  in  1875  against 
Khudaiar,  who,  on  the  24th  July,  escaped  to  the 
Russians  for  protection,  whereupon  the  supporters  of 
Nasir-ud-din  hastened  to  the  capital,  raised  their 
nominee  to  be  Khan,  and  declared  a  religious  war 
with  the  Russians,  the  result  being  that  in  a  few 
weeks  the  Khanate  was  wiped  out  of  existence.  In 
the  spring  of  1876  Khokand  was  formally  annexed  to 
the  Empire,  under  the  name  of  Ferghana,  but  the  tur- 
bulent nomads  in  the  mountains  had  not  yet  sufficiently 
learned  the  necessity  of  submission,  and,  therefore,  the 
Alai  expedition  was  sent  into  the  mountains,  under 
Skobelefif,  and  the  country  completely  subjugated.  It 
was  but  six  years  after  these  events  that  I  entered 
Ferghana  and  its  ancient  capital,  and  to  the  description 
of  my  journey  there  1  shall  now  proceed.

IT  was  pleasant  to  find,  when  arriving  at  Khojend 
on  the  afternoon  of  Friday,  September  22nd, 
that  our  coming  was  expected  by  the  Nachalnik,  who 
immediately  gave  orders  for  the  preparation  of  dinner. 
Whilst  waiting  I  felt  unusually  tired  and  sleepy,  though 
I  know  not  why,  for  we  had  been  travelling  only 
40  hours,  which  was  nothing  in  comparison  with  the 
nights  upon  nights  spent  in  the  tarantass  north  of 
Tashkend ;  but  I  suppose  my  training  had  been  some- 
what demoralized  by  sleeping  in  a  bed,  and  the 
comparative  comforts  we  had  enjoyed  at  the  capital. 
Dinner  over,  the  Colonel  gave  us  a  basket  of  splendid 
fruit,  and  then,  preceded  by  two  djiguitts,  mounted  his 
horse  to  see  us  off.  Thus  escorted  through  the  bazaar, 
the  natives  were  all  politeness  and  attention,  each  rising,

some  bowing,  and  others  dismounting ;  and  so  it  con- 
tinued till  we  had  reached  the  outskirts  of  the  town, 
when  the  Colonel  bade  us  adieu,  and  asked  us  to  call 
in  returning.  We  pursued  our  way  past  the  village  of 
Ispsar,  840  feet  above  the  sea,  and  in  the  evening 
reached  Kostakoz,  where  we  could  have  no  horses, 
we  were  told,  until  11  o'clock.  Whether  this  was 
unavoidable  I  am  not  sure,  but  the  Colonel  had  told 
us  beforehand  that  this  post-master  had  received  notice 
to  quit,  and  so  was  not  in  an  amiable  mood,  on  which 
account,  I  suppose,  a  djiguitt  had  accompanied  us,  but 
who  vainly  asked  for  horses  immediately. 

Towards  midnight  we  started  for  the  remainder  of 
our  little  journey  to  Khokand,*  and  midway  to  the  next 
station  crossed  the  boundary  into  Ferghana.  By  day- 
light we  had  passed  Kara-chukum,  and  once  more 
approached  the  Syr-daria,  on  the  bank  of  which  is 
situated  the  Khokandian  frontier  fortress  of  Makhram, 
a  large  square  building  for  500  Khokandians,  with 
high  crenelated  mud  walls,  and  protected  on  three 
sides  by  a  deep  moat. 

We  were  now  about  1,300  feet  above  the  sea,  and  in 
the  distance  had  mountains  before  us  in  every  direction. 
On  the  left  was  the  Kurama-Tau,  separating  Ferghana 
from  the  Kurama  district,  through  which  we  had  just 
passed.  Over  this  range,  by  the  Kendir  Davan  pass, 
is  a  direct  but  difficult  caravan  route,  open  the  whole 
year,  from  Tashkend  to  Khokand,  and  there  are  three 
other  second-rate  passes   in  the  range,  but  not  very

practicable.  In  the  same  mountains  are  some  rich 
deposits  of  argentiferous  lead.*  In  one  locality  the 
mineral  contains  60  per  cent,  of  lead,  the  latter 
yielding  nearly  an  ounce  of  silver  to  the  ton.  On 
our  right,  but  further  off,  was  the  Turkistan  range 
separating  Ferghana  from  the  Zarafshan  valley,  and 
having  some  coal  mines  at  Kokine-Sai,  25  miles 
south  of  Khojend. 

Immediately  in  front  of  us  was  a  prospect  not  so 
pleasing,  for  we  had  to  cross  a  stony  waste  of  reddish 
sand  for  20  miles,  on  which  there  was  little  vegetation 
but  camels'  food.  As  we  returned,  our  driver  informed 
us  that  he  had  already  driven  the  journey  and  back 
with  his  horses  once,'  so  that  when  he  reached  home 
with  our  steeds,  he  would  have  had  that  day  75  miles 
of  desert  travel.  At  Patar  we  found  a  good  station, 
and  reached  an  oasis  with  vegetation.  Beyond  this 
the  country  was  interspersed  by  desert  patches  of 
shifting  sand,  which  encroaches  like  a  flood,  destroying 
houses  and  cultivated  fields,  and  so  driving  away  the 
population,  t  The  road  from  Patar  was  atrocious.    Here 

*  The  deposit  in  the  Karamazar  mountains,  25  miles  north-east  of 
Khojend,  is  the  richest  of  its  kind  in  Turkistan.     It  is  composed  of 
several  lodes  of  compact  argentiferous  galena  associated  with  blende, 
copper  pyrites,  cryolite,  and  azurite.     The  thickness  of  the  principal 
lode  reaches  7  feet.     The  lodes  all  run  in  a  north-easterly  direction 
with  a  dip  of  80°  towards  S.E.     Some  of  them  are  located  in  the 
metamorphosed  limestone,  near  spots  where  diorite  crops  out.    The 
largest   are  found   where  the   diorite  and  limestone  are  in  contact. 
Judging  from  ancient  workings,  the  metalliferous  lodes  occupy  a  vast 
area    The  principal  gallery  is  situated  at  an  altitude  of  5,000  feet,  and 
a  road,  available  for  carriages,  runs  to  within  6  miles  of  the  mine. 
From  this  point  the  road  remains  practicable  for  sumpter  animals,  but 
in  the  immediate  neighbourhood  there  is  a  lack  of  water. 

f  Of  85  acres  of  cultivated  land  at  Patar,  no  less  than  2^2^  have  been 
overwhelmed.  Here  they  reckon  the  annual  progress  of  the  sand  at  50 
feet.  In  the  case  of  Anderkhan,  also  in  Ferghana,  the  whole  village 
had  to  be  transplanted  to  a  spot  more  than  a  mile  distant.     The  sani

we  saw  dozens  of  sand-heaps,  or  bark/ianSy  which,  by 
reason  of  the  unilateral  direction  of  the  wind,  take  the 
form  of  a  horse-shoe.  These  were  the  first  we  had  met 
with  on  so  considerable  a  scale,  and  they  presented  a 
curious  appearance,  the  surface  being  sometimes  rippled 
as  on  the  seashore.  Some  rose  at  an  angle  of  45''  to 
the  ridge,  here  and  there  perhaps  100  feet  high,  but 
always  descending  abruptly  on  the  interior.  One  had 
only  to  think  of  the  Gharm-sol  wind  to  easily  understand 
why  the  district  in  ancient  times  was  called  **  Ha-Der- 
visky'  from  the  fact,  related  by  Baber,  of  two  dervishes 
having  lost  themselves  in  this  desert  and  perished,  calling 
out  ''Ha-Dervish!  Ha-Dervishr  Fortunately  for  us, 
when  we  passed,  the  air  was  calm  and  the  sand  at  rest. 
The  post-station  at  Bish-aryk  stands  a  little  to  the 
west  of  the  village,  where  there  is  a  bazaar;  and  before 
reaching  the  next  station,  Chuchai,  the  aspect  of  the 
country  had  entirely  changed.  The  roads,  too,  im- 
proved greatly,  verst-posts  appeared,  and  sundry  objects 
testifying  to  the  good  government  of  General  Abramoff 
met  the  eye.  On  either  side  of  the  way  are  rows  of 
trees,  the  land  is  well  cultivated,  and  to  right  and  to 
left  are  seen  gardens  surrounding  houses. 

is  extremely  fine,  runs  about  almost  like  oil,  and  contains  70  per  cent, 
of  quartz.  It  comes  from  the  deposits  of  mountain  torrents,  which  bring 
down  pebbles  from  the  erosion  of  grits,  either  of  the  Jurassic  or  Lower 
Tertiary,  or  from  the  disintegration  of  the  Upper  Tertiary  formations, 
and  further,  from  the  deposits  formed  by  the  Syr  and  Amu  rivers. 
The  little  pools  of  the  Steppe  partially  stop  the  blowing  sand,  and  thus 
begin  the  monticules  that  grow  to  barkhans,  as  the  natives  call  them  ; 
but  it  is  only  vegetation  that  can  stop  them  effectually,  the  plants  most 
efficacious  to  that  end  being  Arundo  arenaria^  Alhagi  catnelorum, 
Halifnodendron  argenteum,  mugwort,  poplars,  etc.  In  the  time  of 
Khudaiar  Khan  the  vegetation  on  the  sand-dunes  was  spared,  but  later 
the  natives  cut  it  down  for  fuel,  and  their  lands  were  further  encroached 
upon,  so  that  the  Russians  have  been  obliged  to  issue  fresh  regulations 
for  the  fixation  of  the  sand-dunes. 


FROM  KHOJEND  TO  KHOKAND,  517 

As  we  approached  the  town  we  saw  men  engaged 
in  building  houses,  which  are  everywhere  made  of  earth 
that  has  been  worked  by  the  feet.* 

As  we  approached  the  town  walls  their  cracked  con- 
dition showed  them  to  be  of  similar  material;  and  as 
we  passed  in  at  the  city  gate  I  noticed  a  platform  on 
either  side,  which  would  serve  alike  for  a  guard-room, 
a  toll-house,  or  perchance  a  place  of  judgment 
or  council.  M.  Nicolai  Nicolaivitch  Ushakoff,  our 
intended  host,  had  promised  to  send  to  the  gate  a 
djiguitt,  or  policeman,  to  await  our  coming  ;  and  when 
we  arrived  about  noon,  the  man  was  there  in  flowing 
robes  and  white  turban,  ready  to  mount  his  horse  and 
precede  us.  I  was  thankful  that  he  did  so,  for  other- 
wise it  would  not  have  been  easy  to  find  the  way. 

Khokand,  being  only  about  a  century  and  a  half 
old,  is  said  to  have  better  streets  than  some  of  the 
older  towns  of  Central  Asia.  In  most  they  are 
irregular  and  narrow,  only  the  main  streets  being 
sufficiently  wide  to  allow  of  the  passage  of  a  native 
cart.  The  shops,  tea  taverns,  and  barbers  rooms  are 
usually  situated  along  both  sides  of  the  main  street, 
leading  from  the  principal  gate  to  the  centre  of  the 

♦  On  the  spot  where  they  purpose  to  have  a  wall  they  place  one  or 
two  rows  of  low  uprights.  To  these  are  fastened  boards  close  to  each 
other,  and  these  are  again  secured  between  more  uprights.  In  the  inter- 
stices between  the  rows  of  boards  braces  are  placed  obliquely,  after 
which  they  begin  to  erect  the  wall  of  mud  balls.  The  walls  are  about 
10  inches  thick,  and  on  them,  to  support  the  roof,  are  placed  beams 
21  inches  apart,  the  intervals  being  filled  with  sticks  about  2  feet  long, 
and  on  these  are  thrown  reeds  or  matting.  It  then  only  remains  to 
smear  the  covering  several  times  with  mud  mixed  with  cut  straw,  and 
Wi^fotolok  or  roof  is  ready.  The  high  windows,  about  14  inches  wide, 
are  generally  inserted  in  the  walls  of  the  courtyard,  and  are  mere 
openings  with  wooden  bars,  like  the  gratings  of  a  prison,  but  sometimes 
paper  is  placed  over  them .  The  floors  are  either  mud-plastered  or  paved 
with  flat,  square,  kiln-burnt  bricks. 


5i8  RUSSJAy^  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

town,  and  on  to  the  market-place,  commonly  called  the 
Rhigistan.     In  the  present  instance,  however,  we  had 
to  make  our  way  through  bye-streets,  with  blank  walls 
on  either  hand,   and  with  just  room  enough  for  our 
vehicle.     There  was  so  little  to  distinguish  one  street 
from  another,  that  we  seemed  to  be  threading  a  perfect 
maze,  until  at  last  we  entered  a  garden  and  grounds 
surrounding  a  house  that  had  been  used  occasionally 
by  the  late   Khudaiar   Khan,    but   was   properly    the 
summer  residence  of  Seid   Nasir  Timbek,  his  eldest 
son.     It  was  of  native  build,  and  the  prettiest  of  its 
kind  I  saw  in  Asia.     There  was  a  central  hall,  perhaps 
40  feet  by  20,  with  chambers  all  round,  screened  off 
by  blinds.     Comparing  the  building  for  a  moment  to 
an  English  church,  it  was  lighted  from  the  clerestory 
through  open  woodwork,  unglazed,  there  being  no  glass 
used  in  the  town  before  the  advent  of  the  Russians, 
except  in  the  Khan's  palace.     The  room  that  would 
represent  the  chancel  was  to  be  my  sleeping  place  ;  at 
the  opposite  end,  on  either  side  of  the  organ  gallery, 
had  been  the  women's  apartments ;  in  the  south  aisle 
was  our  host's  sleeping  place ;  and  in  the  nave  we  were 
to  write,  eat,  and  spend  our  time  by  day,   the  place 
presenting  a  curious  mixture  of  Asiatic  baldness  and 
European  comfort.     The  building  had  been  forfeited, 
I    presume,   to   the   conquerors,  and   granted   to    M. 
Ushakoff  for  a  summer  residence,  though  he  preferred 
to  live  in  the  town  during  winter. 

Our  host,  being  a  judicial  functionary,  had  command 
of  several  djiguitts,  of  whom  a  number  always  accom- 
panied him  in  the  streets,  and  I  soon  saw  that  to  have 
them  was  no  mere  question  of  parade,  but  that  they 
were  of  real  service  in  clearing  the  way.  It  being 
Saturday  afternoon,  I  asked  to  be  taken  to  the  meeting 


FROM  KHOJEND  TO  KHOKAND.  519 

place  of  the  Jews.  M.  Ushakoff  and  the  Nachalnik 
gorod  accompanied  us  in  open  carriages,  and  as  one 
native  after  another  arose  from  his  squatting  position 
and  respectfully  stood  erect,  or  stroked  his  beard,  or 
as  another  dismounted  from  horse  or  camel,  my 
cicerone  drew  my  attention  to  what  he  called  Asiatic 
politeness.  But  it  had  struck  me  in  another  way. 
The  subservience  of  the  Khokandians  excelled  all  I 
met  in  Central  Asia;  and  when  I  remembered  that 
Khokand  had  come  but  recently  under  the  sway  of 
the  Russians,  and  that  only  after  two  or  three 
sound  thrashings,  it  occurred  to  me  that  this  alleged 
politeness  might  be  in  reality  fear.*  Dr.  Schuyler, 
at  all  events,  experienced  no  such  politeness  from  the 
Kkokandians  when  they  were  independent,  nor  did 
we  from  the  natives  in  the  town  of  Bokhara. 

On  arriving  at  the  small  square  white-washed  room 
that  served  for  a  synagogue,  we  found  it  full  of 
worshipping  Jews  wearing  Sart  skull  caps,  and  the 
T!h&  (talitfi),  or  scarf  thrown  across  the  shoulders 
during  prayer ;  and  if  they  had  not  what  we  should 
call  ** fringes"  on  their  garments,  they  at  least  wore 
on  **  the  borders  a  riband  of  blue,"t  with  fringe  at- 
tached. They  wore  also  phylacteries,  or  certain  verses 
from  the  law,  in  a  little  box,  as  **a  sign  unto  thee 
upon  thine  hand,  and  for  a  memorial  between  thine 
eyes"  (Exod.  xiii.  9);  and  I  observed  certain  cases 
where  the  extra  large  size  of  these  tephiltim,  as  they 
term  them,  recalled  the  words,  **  They  make  broad 
their  phylacteries,  and  enlarge  the  borders  of  their  gar- 

^  I  could  not  help  thinking  of  the  promise  to  the  Israelites :  "  This 
day  will  I  begin  to  put  the  dread  of  thee  and  the  fear  of  thee  among 
the  nations"  (Deut.  xi.  25),  for  no  Khokandian  seemed  to  dare  to 
*'  move  his  tongue  against  any  of  the  "  Russians  (Josh.  x.  21). 

t  Numb.  XV.  38.

ments"  (Matt,  xxiii.  5).  They  were  all  reading  aloud, 
and  led  by  a  precentor,  and  my  attention  was  called  at 
a  portion  of  the  service  to  the  prayer  for  the  Russian 
Emperor.*  My  letter  of  commendation  obtained  for 
me  a  speedy  welcome,  and  I  began  to  inquire  for 
ancient  manuscripts,  but  they  had  none,  their  quite 
modern  copy  of  the  law  having  been  written  in  Bokhara 
at  a  cost  of  ;^i5.  I  gave  them  a  copy  of  the  Old 
Testament  and  of  the  New.  both  in  Hebrew,  and 
in  return  a  man  presented  me  with  a  ring,  which  he 
appeared  to  wear  as  a  talisman. f  In  a  second  place 
of  assembly  close  by,  we  found  women  present,  parted 
off  from  the  men,  but  not  veiled.  My  further  inquiry 
for  old  manuscripts  elicited  the  statement  that  there 
was  a  genizahy  or  place  of  sepulture,  in  Samarkand, 
where  many  Hebrew  books  are  buried,  though  subse- 
quently I  could  hear  nothing  about  them  there.  Whilst 
speaking  to  a  Jew  from  Bokhara,  and  asking  whether 
they  remembered  Dr.  Wolff  coming  there,  he  gave  me 
the  interesting  reply  that  his  father  saved  the  life  of 
"  Ytisuf  Voolffy'  who  appeared  at  Bokhara  **  the  first 
time  as  a  Jew,  but  later  as  an  ambassador." 

Subsequently  an  intelligent  Jew  came  to  our  house 
to  buy  copies  of  the  Old  Testament,  cunningly  adding, 
**  They  do  not  buy  the  New  Testament  here,"  though 
he  had  commenced  reading,  he  said,  the  one  I  gave 
him.  I  took  the  opportunity  to  ask  him  concerning 
the  Jews  in  Central  Asia,  who,  he  said,  were  descended 

*  Thus  showing  that  they  were  not  forgetful  of  the  counsel  of  the 
prophet  Jeremiah  (xxix.  7) :  *'  Seek  the  peace  of  the  city  whither  I  have 
caused  you  to  be  carried  away  captives,  and  pray  unto  the  Lord  for  it ; 
for  in  the  peace  thereof  shall  ye  have  peace.** 

t  On  it  is  written,  HB^Vn  ^3:r  I^KO  n"n  Knb«,  which  gives  the  name 
of  the  priest  from  whom  the  ring  came,  thus  (literally),  *'  God  of  rabbi 
Mayer,  answer  me  in  Thy  mercy,  O  Lord.**

from  Judah  and  Benjamin,  the  two  tribes   dispersed 
over  Europe  and  Asia,   whereas   the   ten   tribes,    he 
thought,   were  dwelling    "beyond  China."*     In  Kho- 
kand  he  informed   us   there   were   from    200   to  3CX> 
Israelitish  residents,  and  from  300  to  400  sojourners, 
mostly  merchants,  dyers,  manufacturers,  and  druggists. 
I  expressed  surprise  that  they  had  no  regular  synagogue, 
but  he  explained  that  until  the  advent  of  the  Russians 
the   Jews  had  been  fewer  in   number,  that  they  had 
no  right  to  buy  land,  and  were  forbidden  by  the  Khan 
to  build  a  synagogue  ;  that  they  were,  in  fact,  under 
similar  restrictions  to  those  from  which  their  brethren 
in  Bokhara  still  suffered.     They  could   not  enter  the 
city  mounted,  were  forbidden  to  wear  a  turban,  and 
allowed  only  a  black  calico  cap  for  the  head,  and  a 
piece  of  string  for  a  girdle;  and  though  they  were 
compelled  to  pay  double  taxes,  as  compared  with  the 
Sarts,  yet  if  a  Jew  were  insulted,  or  even  beaten,  by 
a    Muhammadan,    he   could   claim    no   redress,    and, 
moreover,  that  four  or  five  Jews,  during  the  later  years 
of  the  Khanate,  had  been  compelled  to  become  Mussul- 
mans.    I  asked  whether  I  could  do  anything  for  the 
welfare  of  him  and  his  brethren,  whereupon  he  said 
that  under  the  Russians  the  Jews  were  free,  and  had 
no   need   of  help,    but  that  they  were  oppressed    in 
Bokhara,    the    15,000  Jews  in  that  city  being  allowed 
to  have  only   one  synagogue.     I  inquired   for  a  cer- 
tain  Israelite,    to  whom   I   had    an    introduction,   and 
learned  that  he  was  at  Samarkand.     A  letter  also  was 
given  me  to  a  Jew  in  that  place,  from  one  in  Khokand, 
and  at  first  a  letter  of  introduction  was  promised  to 

•  He  thus  testified  from  an  independent  source  to  certain  migrations 
of  Jews  to  China,  on  which  Mr.  Finn  has  thrown  considerable  light,  and 
to  which  I  shall  allude  hereafter.

one  in  Bokhara,  but  the  promise  was  afterwards  with- 
drawn, through  fear  lest  the  name  of  the  giver  should 
come  to  the  ears  of  the  Emir,  and  punishment  might 
thereby  ensue ! 

From  the  synagogue  we  went  to  the  bazaar,  \Vhich 
I  did  not  see  to  advantage,  because  it  was  not  one  of 
the  bi-weekly  market  days,  Thursday  or  Sunday,  but 
which  Dr.  Schuyler  and  M.  Ujfalvy  agree  in  praising 
as  the  best  in  Central  Asia.  The  streets  are  roofed 
over  like  a  succession  of  lofty  arcades,  affording  air,  and 
shelter  from  the  sun.  One  meets  there  with  all  the  pro- 
ducts of  Central  Asia  :  silk  and  velvet  from  Bokhara ; 
silks,  stuffs,  and  camlets  from  Marghilan  ;  hand-worked 
copper  goods  made  at  Karshi  and  in  Khokand  itself, 
where  the  coppersmiths  are  very  skilful ;  leather 
trunks  from  Bokhara ;  Dungan  hats  from  Western 
China ;  tibiteikas,  or  skull  caps,  of  various  patterns ; 
khalats,  or  robes  of  startling  colours,  in  satin  and  silk  ; 
Samarkand  knives,  jewellery,  and  objects  cut  in  jade 
and  onyx.  The  jewellers  of  Khokand  make  numerous 
earrings,  ornamented  with  imitation  stones.  The 
bracelets  of  massive  silver  are  open,  like  those  of  the 
Middle  Ages,  and  their  gold  collarettes  and  silver  seals 
rival  those  of  Samarkand.  The  ancient  jewellery  is 
more  remarkable,  the  forms  are  more  original,  and  the 
stones  sometimes  real,  thus  pointing  to  an  age  when 
goldsmiths  flourished  in  Central  Asia. 

I  was  struck  with  the  brass  ewers,  for  the  manu- 
facture of  which  Khokand  is  famous.  They  are  made 
of  graceful  form,  and  tastefully  chiselled,  the  ancient 
specimens  often  presenting  beautiful  enamel  work.  I 
secured  a  handsome  one  for  the  British  Museum,  and 
had  another,  still  handsomer,  presented  to  me  in 
Khiva.     I  bought,  likewise,  a  teapot  of  similar  work-

manship,  and  speciniens  of  native  finger-  and  ear-rings, 
buckles,  bracelets,  and  charms.  Among  other  articles 
of  trade  brought  to  Khokand  from  the  surrounding 
mountains  are  various  kinds  of  furs,  the  prices  of 
which  vary  from  2s,  for  a  black  cat,  or  a  black  sheep- 
skin, to  40J.  for  a  black  lambskin,  or  50^.  for  that  of  a 
tiger.*  Before  the  annexation  of  the  Khanate,  opinions 
differed  widely  as  to  its  wealth  and  the  extent  of  its 
commerce.  According  to  the  figures  of  M.  Petrovsky, 
it  appears  that,  in  1872,  56  varieties  of  imports  to 
Khokand,  from  6  sources,  amounted  in  value  to  only 
;^5 1,426,  whilst  there  were  exported  from  Khokand, 
to  7  destinations,  33  varieties  of  merchandise  to  the 
value  of  ;^64,844,  an  increase  over  the  imports  of 
j^i3,4i8.t  Whether  trade  has  increased  since  the 
annexation  of  the  Khanate  in  1876  I  know  not.  I 
am  not  aware  that  statistics  have  been  published. 
One  merchant,  however,  told  me  that  the  carrying 
firm  he  was  connected  with  did  business,  in  the  time 
of  the  Khan,  to  the  value  of  ;^2,ooo  a  year,  but  that 
it  had  now  fallen  to  one-fourth  of  that  amount.

524  RUSSIAJV  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

From  the  bazaar  we  made  our  way  to  the  brick 
medresse  of  Sultan  Murad  Bek,  looked  into  some  of 
the  students*  rooms,  and  then  mounted  the  minaret 
to  get  a  view  of  the  town,  the  general  appearance 
of  which,  as  with  other  inhabited  places  in  Central 
Asia,  is  decidedly  unattractive,  for  patches  of  green 
are  its  sole  adornment.  Nevertheless  the  natives 
call  it  **  Khokand-i-Latif,"  or  **  charming  Khokand," 
which  title  must  refer,  I  suppose,  to  its  surroundings, 
consisting  of  the  snow  mountains  we  could  see  in 
more  than  one  direction.  Anciently  the  place  was 
environed  by  marshes  and  frequented  by  wild  boars, 
whence  the  town  is  supposed  to  derive  its  name 
**  Khok-kand,*'  or  **  town  of  pigs."  Doves  were 
flying  above  the  uninviting  mud  roofs,  and  in  the 
distance  were  the  city  walls,  said  to  be  12  miles  in 
circumference,  enclosing  a  population  of  60,000  souls. 
It  was  not  easy  to  distinguish  particular  buildings,  but 
they  have  in  Khokand  a  manufactory  that  supplies 
many  of  the  Central  Asian  towns  with  writing-paper, 
suitable  for  the  gummy  ink  the  natives  use  for  writing, 
but  the  Russians  import  their  paper  from  Europe. 
Whilst  we  were  looking  from  the  minaret  the  sun 
went  down,  whereupon  we  saw  some  of  the  students 
go  to  evening  prayer,  and  we  started  homewards, 
to  be  joined  at  dinner  by  Major  Vladimir  Alexan- 
drovich  Tolmatcheff,  in  command  of  the  Cossacks, 
a  young  man  for  a  major,  but  who  had  distinguished 
himself,  if  I  remember  rightly,  in  the  province 
under  Skobeleff,  and  who,  now  that  fighting  was 
over,  seemed  to  find  things  exceedingly  dull. 
After  dinner,  M.  Ushakoff  had  prepared  us  an 
evening's  amusement  with  native  marionettes.  A 
puppet-show    was    put    up  in    his  room,  in  front  of 


FROM  KHOJEND  TO  KHOKAND.  525 

which  two  men  played  tambourines.  The  late  Khan 
and  his  courtiers  were  placed  on  the  stage,  and  for 
their  amusement  miniature  dancing  boys  and  girls  were 
made  to  play  their  part  before  them.  This  was  done 
with  considerable  fidelity  to  nature.  Next  the  Emir  of 
Afghanistan  was  introduced  as  having  40,000  soldiers, 
and  the  Khan  of  Khokand  30,000,  and  then  some- 
thing like  a  battle  was  enacted,  on  which  the  Russians 
stepped  in,  and  put  them  both  to  flight,  the  affair  con- 
cluding by  firing  miniature  cannons. 

I  needed  no  rocking  that  night  to  send  me  to  sleep, 
and  on  the  following  morning  was  taken  to  call  on 
General  Iphimovitch,  who  was  for  the  time  being 
acting  as  Governor  of  the  province  in  the  room  of 
General  Abramoff.  We  found  his  Excellency  with 
his  staff  under  silk  tents  in  a  garden,  where  we  were 
offered  fruit.  Then  we  followed  the  General  in  making 
an  official  tour  of  inspection,  first  to  the  barracks 
and  next  to  the  military  hospital.  The  latter  was  an 
airy  building,  said  to  have  been  erected  by  the  late 
Khan  for  an  asylum,  but  never  finished,  and  since 
adapted  to  its  present  use  by  the  Russians.  W^ 
next  went  to  the  prison,  where,  in  taking  notes,  my 
stylographic  pen — the  first  seen  in  the  town — puzzled 
the  bystanders  to  know  where  the  ink  came  from. 
There  was  nothing  remarkable  in  any  of  the  buildings 
thus  far  visited,  but  we  next  entered  a  place  of  greater 
interest — namely,  the  palace  of  the  late  Khan  of 
Khokand.  I  had  seen  many,  if  not  most,  of  the 
regal  and  imperial  palaces  of  Europe,  but  never 
before  the  dwelling  of  an  Asiatic  potentate,  and  this 
one  called  for  the  more  attention  because  in  archi- 
tectural pretensions  it  outdoes  any  other  modern  native 
building   in    Central   Asia.      The   urda,   or,    as   it   is 


526  liUSSIAK  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

called  in   Bokhara,  the    ''ark,''   which,   like   kremlin^ 
means    **  the   citadel,"    is   situated    in    the    centre    of 
the  town,    in   an   open   space   large   enough    for   the 
Russian  troops  to  exercise  in.     It  is  a  huge  rectan- 
gular construction,  enclosing  several  courts  and  build- 
ings, and  surrounded  with  moat  and  high  walls.     A 
portion  of  these  latter  was  blown  up  with  dynamite^ 
by  order  of  Skobeleff,  at  the  taking  of  the  town,  to 
the  great  astonishment  and  stupefaction  of  the  natives, 
by  whom  the  like  was  never  seen  before.     The  palace 
has  towers  at  the  corners   and    two   in    the    centre, 
the  whole  front  being  faced  with  glazed  tiles,  white, 
green,  and  blue,  with  a  large  inscription  running  along 
the   cornice,    **  Built   by   Seid    Muhammad   Khudaiar 
Khan  in  the  year  1287'*  (1870).     We  approached  the 
entrance  up  a  corduroy  slope,  and  found  at  the  palace 
gates  two  copper  cannons,  of  native  manufacture,  with 
silver  inscriptions,   not  rifled,  and  with  bores  hardly 
smooth.     The   gates  of  the   building   were  of  finely- 
carved   wood.      On   entering,    we   found    the    courts 
very  spacious,  and  surrounded  by  open  galleries,  the 
supporting    columns    being    of    wood,    with    graceful 
capitals.     The  painting    on    the   friezes  and  ceilings 
was  extremely  fine  and  varied,  and  was  perhaps  the 
most  artistic  feature  of  the  palace,  for  the  enamelled 
bricks   did  not   bear  close   inspection,   and   were  not 
equal  to  those  of  mediaeval  make  such  as  we  afterwards 
saw  in  Samarkand. 

The  Khan's  throne  room,  where  ambassadors  used 
to  be  received,  now  serves  for  a  Russian  chapel, 
wherein  the  walls  are  highly  painted  and  the  window- 
shutters  carved.  The  room  in  which  the  Russian 
commandant  was  living  was  filled  with  European 
curiosities  at  the  time  of  taking  the  town,  and  among 


528  'RUSSIAN  CJEN7RAL  ASIA, 

them  were  models  of  a  railway-engine  and  a  steam- 
boat.    Another  room,  in  which  Khudaiar  used  in  the 
morning  to  receive  his  ministers,  had  a  floor  of  beaten 
earth,  with  carved  alabaster  let  into  the  walls.     This 
chamber  the  Russians  had  appropriated  for  a  school- 
room for  45  scholars,  of  whom   13  were  Russians,   23 
Jews,   and  9    Sarts.      But   the   chamber   upon    which 
more   ornamentation   had    been    bestowed   than   any 
other  was  the  Khan's  cabinet,  painted  and  gilded  in 
Moorish    style.     The    Russian    officers    thought    the 
ornamentation  could  not  have  cost  less  than  ;^500 ;  but, 
though  somewhat  similar  in  style,  it  did  not  equal  in 
beauty  the   finished   Alhambra   court    in   the    Crystal 
Palace.     The    splendour    was   decidedly    ''  barbaric,*' 
and  from   the  room  was  an    exit   to  a  gallery  over- 
looking a  courtyard,  whence  the   Khan  was  wont  to 
give  his  orders,   and,   I   fancy  we  were  told,    to  see 
his  criminals  put   to   death.     The  part  of  the  palace 
that  was  used  for  a  prison  in  the  Khan's  time  is,   I 
believe,  not  used  for  that  purpose  now. 

In  this  courtyard  trials  were  formerly  conducted,  and 
through  it  we  passed  to  the  women's  quarter  of  the 
palace.  They  had,  set  apart  for  their  use,  a  summer 
pavilion  in  the  centre  of  a  court,  of  which  the  domes 
were  of  variegated  colours,  no  two  being  alike ;  and 
we  mounted  by  sloping  boards  to  an  upper  story  to 
enter  their  empty  winter  apartments,  whence  we  could 
see  the  vine  groves  of  the  palace  gardens. 

From  the  palace  I  was  taken  to  see  some  fellow- 
subjects  in  the  persons  of  a  few  Hindus,  as  well  as 
their  tiny  place  of  worship  ;  and  after  that,  at  my 
special  desire,  though  apparently  to  my  host's  sur- 
prise, we  went  to  the  most  miserable  place  in 
Khokand — the     lepers'    village,     outside     the    town, 


FROM  KHOJEND  TO  KHOKAND.  529 

passing  rice-6elds  on  my  way.  These  two  sights 
shall  be  described  hereafter;  but,  having  done  what 
little  1  could  for  the  lepers,  we  paid  a  second  visit  to 
the  medresse.  I  had  been  distributing  Russian  tracts 
and  other  reading  material  in  the  barracks,  hospital, 
and  elsewhere,  but  unfortunately  I  had  none  in  the 
languages  of  the  natives,  except  a  few  ponderous 
Persian  Bibles  and  Arabic  New  Testaments.  I  was 
anxious    to    give    one    of  each    for   the   use   of    the 


students,  though  M.  UshakofT,  as  he  afterwards  told 
me,  was  not  without  some  little  fear  as  to  how  such 
an  offer  would  be  received.  1  asked,  however,  for  the 
principal  mullah,  and  placed  the  Bible  in  his  hand, 
telling  him  that  it  was  the  best  book  we  had  in 
England,  and  that  I  begged  his  acceptance  thereof 
as  a  memorial  of  my  visit.  He  bowed,  received  it 
with  great  satisfaction,  and  soon  showed  that  he  could 
read  it,  whereupon  I  desired  him  to  let  it  be  read  by 
all  the  students.

We  then  went  home,  thinking  to  spend  a  quiet  even- 
ing ;  but,  having  a  letter  of  introduction  to  a  native 
merchant,  I  did  not  like  to  omit  the  friendly  mission 
and  proposed  accordingly  to  call.  My  host,  however, 
decided  that  it  would  be  more  in  keeping  with  their 
custom  with  the  natives  to  send  for  the  merchant  to 
come  to  me,  which  he  did.  When  the  man  discovered 
that  I  had  brought  an  introduction  all  the  way  from 
Moscow,  he  entreated  that,  though  late,  we  would 
honour  him  with  a  visit  Accordingly,  Sevier  and  I 
were  conducted  to  this  merchant  s  house,  which  I  was 
glad  to  see  as  a  specimen  of  a  native  interior.  We 
had  been  introduced  at  Tashkend,  as  I  have  said,  to  a 
rich  Jew,  in  whose  house  the  reception-room  closely 
resembled  that  of  the  merchant  at  Khokand.  We  saw 
something  too  at  Tashkend  of  the  women  of  the  house, 
who  were  dressed  in  Sart  fashion,  but  were  not  veiled. 
We  were  not  introduced  to  them,  though  they  did  not 
appear  to  think  our  presence  strange,  and  they  were 
evidently  not  kept  in  seclusion.  In  the  merchant's 
house  at  Khokand  we  saw  not  a  shadow  of  a  female, 
but  were  shown  into  a  room  carpeted,  indeed,  but 
without  furniture,  the  principal  attractions  of  the 
chamber  to  us  being  a  number  of  niches  in  the  wall, 
wherein  were  placed  crockery,  pans,  teapots,  and 
earthenware  goods  from  Russia  and  China.  In  due 
time  was  brought  in  a  small,  low,  round  table  with 
refreshments,  near  which  our  host  squatted  on  the 
ground,  whilst  we  were  provided  with  chairs  so  high 
that  we  had  to  stoop  to  help  ourselves  from  the  festive 
board.  I  invited  questions  concerning  the  country  we 
came  from,  whereupon  the  merchant  asked  about  our 
commerce,  and  the  chief  kinds  of  merchandise  in 
England.     My  answers  interested  him,  especially  when

I  went  on  to  tell  him  that  we  had  railways  by  which 
we  could  travel  the  distance  from  Khokand  to  Tash- 
kend  in  four  or  five  hours. 

On  returning  to  M.  Ushakoff,  he  showed  us  some 
sticks  of  opium  that  had  been  seized  as  contraband, 
and  also  some  coats  of  mail  that  were  in  use  by  the 
natives  when  the  town  was  taken.  After  this  we 
walked  in  the  garden.  It  was  a  beautiful  night  at  the 
end  of  September,  but  not  at  all  cold,  and  I  wished 
that  I  could  have  stayed  longer  in  the  province.  It 
would  have  been  easy  to  drive  round  the  southern  half 
on  the  post-road  through  Novi  Marghilan  to  Andijan, 
whence  there  is  a  carriage-road  back  through  the 
northern  half  of  the  province,  by  way  of  Namangan

t  For  the  first  fifty  miles  to  Fort  Gulcha,  or  a  little  beyond,  it  has  been 
converted  into  a  cart-road,  and  thence  the  track  traverses  mountains 
and  gorges,  and  comes  into  the  Kashgarian  plateau  2}^  miles  from 
Kashgar,  the  most  serious  obstacle  being  the  pass  over  the  Terek- 
Davan,  12,700  feet  high.  From  the  end  of  April  till  the  beginning  of 
October  travel  here  is  stopped  by  the  melting  of  the  snow,  and  caravans 
at  this  time  of  year  are  sent  from  Osh  by  a  more  circuitous  route  over 
the  Alai  by  the  Tau-Murun  pass.  This,  again,  is  not  practicable 
throughout  the  year,  but  only  from  the  middle  of  June  to  the  middle  of 
October.  Anyone,  therefore,  who  aspires  to  be  the  first  Englishman  to 
traverse  this  route  will  do  well  to  remember  that  during  May  and  the 
first  half  of  June  the  journey  is  not  practicable  by  either  of  the  two 
routes  mentioned,  though  for  ten  months  and  a  half  he  may  cross  by  one 
road  or  the  other. 


532  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

The  distance  on  my  Russian  map  from  the  most 
southerly  point  in  the  Ferghana  province  to  the  most 
northerly  point  in  India,  above  Cashmere,  is  233  miles  ; 
but  the  line  would  pass  over  what  may  be  regarded  as 
the  unknown  parts  of  the  Pamir.  There  are,  however, 
at  least  five  routes  by  which  Khokand  may  be  reached 
from  Peshawur,*  and  there  are  sundry  routes  passing 
over  the  South  Khokand  range,  any  one  of  which 
offers  an  unbeaten  path  to  an  English  traveller.  But 
my  heart  was  set  upon  seeing  Bokhara,  and,  if  possible, 
floating  on  the  Oxus  to  Khiva.  Remembering,  there- 
fore, that  the  season  was  advancing,  and  as  I  knew  not 
what  crossing  the  desert  in  early  winter  might  mean,  I 
denied  myself  the  seeing  more  of  Ferghana,  and  deter- 
mined to  leave  on  the  morrow  for  Samarkand. 

♦  The  most  easterly  is  by  Cashmere  and  Ladak,  crossing  the  Kara- 
Konim  range  to  Yarkand  and  Kashgar,  and  so  on  to  Osh,  by  the  route 
I  have  just  indicated.  This  is  the  most  circuitous.  The  second  pro- 
ceeds from  Peshawur  through  the  Bajour  and  Upper  Komur  valleys  into 
Badakshan,  the  most  direct  but  the  most  difficult  route.  The  three  re- 
maining routes  proceed  in  the  first  instance  to  Cabul,  and  beyond  that  the 
best,  and  most  westerly,  passes  through  Balkh  and  Bokhara  to  Khokand. 
The  other  two  routes,  known  as  those  of  Pamir  and  Kolab,  after  crossing 
the  Hindu  Kush,  lead  through  Kunduz  to  Badakshan,  and  there  diverge, 
one  crossing  the  Pamir,  and  entering  by  the  Terek  Pass  into  Khokand, 
the  other  proceeding  through  the  Darwaz  district,  and  entering  Fer- 
ghana by  the  pass  of  Ust- Kurgan,  four  marches  south-west  of  Khokand.

THE  Zarafshan  **  circle,"  or  province,  is  a  triangular 
valley,  having  its  apex  at  the  upper  waters 
of  the  River  Zarafshan,  and  extending  east  and 
west.  On  the  north  it  is  bounded  by  parts  of  the 
Kyzyl-Kum,  the  Khojend  uyezd,  and  Ferghana ;  on 
the  east  by  the  Koku-Su  mountains ;  on  the  west  by 
the  fertile  parts  of  Bokhara  ;  and  on  the  south  by  the 
Bokhariot  bekships  of  Karategin,  Hissar,  Shahr-i-sabz, 
and  Karshi.  The  province  measures,  from  east  to 
west,  about  250  miles,  and  the  base  of  the  triangle 
100  miles,  with  an  area  of  about  10,000  square  miles, 
of  which  one-half  is  mountainous.  It  has  been  already 
pointed  out  that  the  South  Khokand  mountain  ridge 
divides  into  three  parallel  chains  running  westward — 
namely,  the  Turkistan,  Zarafshan,  and  Hissar  ranges, 
and  it  is  by  these  three  chains  that  the  valley  is  formed. 


5J4  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

being  bisected  by  the  Zarafshan  range,  which  parts  off 
on  the  north  the  basin  of  the  river  of  that  name  from 
that  of  its  Fan  and  Yagnab  tributaries.* 

The  name  of  the  Zarafshan  in  Persian  signifies 
"gold-strewing,"  either  by  reason  of  the  precious 
metal  found  in  the  river,  or,  perhaps,  because  of  the 
prosperity  diffused  by  its  waters.  The  river  belongs 
to  the  water  system  of  the  Oxus,  of  which  it  was  once 
an  affluent,  but  now  its  waters  are  so  drained  by  irriga- 
tion, that  the  stream  stops  short  of  the  main  river  by 
60  miles,  and  its  last  waters  fall  into  a  lake.  The 
source  of  the  Zarafshan  was  unknown  to  science  till 
the  Russians  discovered  it  in  the  huge  glacier  already 
mentioned,  nearly  9,000  feet  above  the  sea.  For  the 
first  1 30  miles  of  its  course,  due  west,  to  the  town  of 
Pianjkend,  or  Penjakend,  the  Zarafshan  is  a  mountain 
torrent,  hurrying  through  a  narrow  gorge,  with  an 
average  fall  of  23  feet  in  3,500,  or  y^,  so  swift  that 
it  can  scarce  be  ridden  through  even  in  winter,  or  in 
parts  be  measured  in  depth,  and  boats  cannot  stem  its 

•  All  three  ranges,  in  their  eastern  portions,  are  exceedingly  high ; 
towards  the  west  they  decrease  in  height,  the  Hissar  mountains  remain- 
ing the  finest  and  loftiest  range.  The  northern,  or  Turkistan  range, 
has  peaks  that  rise  to  20,000  feet,  and  the  immense  Zarafshan  glacier, 
whose  length  is  estimated  at  from  25  to  40  miles,  with  a  breadth  at 
its  lower  part  of  800  yards.  Eastward  the  glacier  entirely  closes  the 
end  of  the  valley.  The  huge  mass,  covered  with  cones  of  all  sizes,  is 
joined  by  many  lateral  glaciers,  and  slopes  downwards  very  gently.  On 
it  are  clearly  seen  moraines,  some  of  them  with  boulders  of  rock,  foreign 
to  the  neighbouring  mountains.  The  Turkistan  range  is  not  a  compact 
mass,  but  consists  of  mountains  placed  in  terraces,  and  intersected 
sometimes  by  rather  deep  valleys.  The  range  may  be  crossed  by  twenty 
passes,  all,  with  the  exception  of  two,  being  difficult  and  high.  The 
Yani-Sabak  and  Shahristan  passes  ascend  to  13,600  and  10,700  feet 
respectively.  The  Zarafshan  range  at  Varsa-Minar,  where  it  is  high 
and  regular,  is  cut  due  north  and  south  by  a  very  deep  valley,  with 
narrow  and  perpendicular  sides,  through  which  dashes  the  Fan  mountain 
stream  ;  and  further  west  the  range  is  furrowed  by  two  more  affluents 
of  the  Zarafshan,  the  Kshtut  and  Magian.     This  range  is  crossed  by 


THE  ZARAFSHAN  PROVINCE.  535 

current.  It  is  spanned  by  thirty  crazy  bridges,  some 
of  them  being  occasionally  swept  away  at  the  flood, 
and  always  dangerous.  The  stream  receives  no  impor- 
tant affluents  on  its  right  bank,  but  three  large  ones 
from  the  left,  the  Fan,  Kshtut,  and  Magian.*  The 
Fan  brings  to  the  river  nearly  as  much  water  as  it 
already  possesses,  after  which  the  main  stream,  greatly 
enlarged,  leaves  the  mountains. 

Now  begins  the  Middle  Zarafshan,  120  miles  long,  to 
the  Bokhariot  frontier,  beyond  which  is  the  lower  course 
of  1 50  miles,  making  400  in  all.  Beyond  Penjakend 
large  canals  are  diverted  from  the  river  on  either  side 
for  irrigation  of  the  fields  ;  but  the  stream  flows  on  in 
one  large  bed  to  the  Chupan-Ata  hills,  where,  5  miles 
north  of  Samarkand,  the  Zarafshan  is  divided  into  two 
streams.  The  northern,  or  main  stream,  is  called  the 
Ak-daria,  the  southern,  the  Kara-daria,  and  after 
flowing  ten  or  twelve  miles  apart,  they  reunite  on  the 
boundary  line  of  the  province.  Hence  the  Zarafshan 
forms  by  its  branches  an  island,  called  the  Miankal, 
which  is  the  richest  and  most  thickly  populated  portion 
of  the  valley.     Here  not  a  scrap  of  ground  lies  idle, 

seven  passes  east  of  the  Fan,  the  southern  descents,  as  a  rule,  being 
shorter  and  steeper  than  the  northern,  as  is  the  case  in  the  Turkistan 
range  ;  and  in  both  it  may  be  observed  that  the  rivers  flowing  to  the 
north  are  larger  than  those  flowing  south.  There  are  other  passes 
further  west,  by  one  of  which,  the  Kara-Tiube,  I  crossed  into  Bokhara. 
The  Hissar  chain,  traversed  by  eleven  roads  and  passes,  separates  the 
waters  flowing  into  the  Zarafshan  from  those  proceeding  to  the  Surkhab, 
and  gives  off  to  the  south  and  south-west  a  mass  of  high  chains  covered 
with  perpetual  snows  and  very  large  glaciers. 

*  The  Fan  brings  down  water  from  the  Iskander-Kul,  the  only  lake 
in  the  province,  and  named  after  Alexander  of  Macedon.  It  lies  at  an 
elevation  of  7,000  feet  above  the  sea,  is  about  2  square  miles  in  area, 
and  is  decreasing  in  level.  Hills,  3,000  feet  high,  surround  this  fresh- 
water basin,  which  measures  200  feet  deep,  but  has  water-marks,  in  the 
form  of  horizontal  bands,  300  feet  higher  on  the  slopes  of  the  hills  and 
the  communicating  valleys. 


536  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

all  being  cultivated  in  the  most  careful  manner.  The 
island  gardens  receive  their  water  from  the  southern 
arm  of  the  river,  and  the  Ak-daria  is  used  to  water 
the  fields  on  its  northern  banks.  In  order  to  increase 
the  waters  on  the  Kara-daria,  or  southern  arm,  a  dam, 
annually  destroyed  by  the  spring  floods,  is  placed  every 
summer  at  the  Chupan-Ata  hills  to  direct  the  great 
portion  of  the  Zarafshan  water  into  the  southern  arm. 
This  is  of  great  importance  to  Bokhara,  because  from 
the  Kara-daria  is  diverted  the  large  Nurpai  canal,  on 
which  some  of  the  Bokhariot  bekships  depend.  There 
are  other  canals  besides  the  Nurpai  diverted  from 
the  Kara-daria,  flowing  along  terraces  one  above 
another,  fringed  with  rows  of  trees,  and  giving  to  the 
locality  an  original  and  picturesque  appearance.  Each 
minor  canal  is  taken  at  an  obtuse  angle  from  the  main 
one,  and  runs  almost  parallel  thereto.  Along  each 
of  these  canals  there  are  sometimes  as  many  as  ten 
villages,  each  having  its  own  smaller  canal.  Water- 
courses are  supplied  from  these  to  the  fields.  Some 
of  the  canals  are  extended  far  (the  Dargam,  for 
instance,  46  miles),  and  they  water  fields  20  miles  wide 
of  the  river.  Each  main  canal  has  its  own  system  of 
villages,  but  not  entirely  independent  of  each  other, 
because  some  of  the  water,  after  irrigating  the  fields 
of  one  system,  is  conducted  onwards  to  the  next. 

Hence,  though  the  Zarafshan  is  a  swift  and  copious 
river  in  the  mountains,  it  gradually  becomes  an  ex- 
hausted stream.*     The   Zarafshan,   like   the    Nile,   in 

♦  Its  most  important  ford  is  on  the  Tashkend  postal-road,  five  miles 
north  of  Samarkand,  where  the  stream  separates  into  numerous 
branches,  of  which  the  principal  is  70  yards  wide.  The  river  has  in 
the  course  of  the  year  three  overflows,  dependent  on  the  rains  and  the 
melting  of  the  snow.  The  water  is  lowest  in  winter,  and  on  the 
Bokhariot  frontier,  though  not  further  east,  it  is  usually  frozen  for  three 
weeks  in  January. 


THE  ZARAFSHAN  PROVINCE,  537 

flood  deposits  an  ooze  that  is  apparently  very  fertiliz- 
ing, and  from  of  old  has  attracted  inhabitants  to  the 
banks.  The  ancient  Sogdiana  was  situated  on  the 
Zarafshan,  and  its  chief  town  Miranda,  or  Maracanda, 
occupied  the  site  of  Samarkand.  Other  towns  on  the 
banks,  or  those  of  its  tributaries,  are  Kshtut  and 
Magian,  on  rivers  of  those  names,  and,  on  the  main 
river,   Dashty-Kazy,   Penjakend,  and  Katte  Kurgan. 

Thus  it  will  be  seen  that  the  Zarafshan  province 
occupies  the  upper  and  middle  valleys  of  the  river. 
When,  in  1 868,  the  Russians  took  from  the  Bokhariots 
Samarkand,  Urgut,  and  Katte  Kurgan,  the  district 
was  formed  into  the  Zarafshan  circle.  Towards  the 
close  of  the  same  year  Penjakend  was  added,  as  also, 
in  1870-71,  the  bekships  of  Falgar,  Machin,  Fan, 
Yagnab,  Magian,  and  others.  At  the  present  time 
the  province  consists  of  the  Katte  Kurgan,  the  Samar- 
kand, and  the  Penjakend  districts. 

This  last,  or  mountainous  portion,  was  formerly 
known  as  Kohistan,  the  principal  formation  of  its  rocks 
being  schistous.*  The  bottom  of  the  valley  consists 
of  conglomerates,  and  near  Samarkand  is  a  deposit  of 
rock  salt.t     Only  one  eighty-fifth  part  of  Kohistan  is 

*  Carboniferous  rocks  are  often  met  with,  and  on  the  banks  of  the 
Yagnab,  but  in  out-of-the-way  places,  are  thick  beds  of  lignite  coal  and 
iron.  On  the  left  bank  of  the  Fan  is  found  yellow  potter's  clay.  Gold 
is  washed  down  the  course  of  the  Zarafshan  in  grains  and  thin  leaves, 
but  in  such  small  quantities  that  four  natives  working  for  a  day 
will  earn  only  about  ^d,  each.  In  certain  villages  alum  is  prepared 
from  kali.  Kali  is  found  in  other  parts  of  Turkistan  under  various 
forms,  such  as  issegik  {anabasis  aphylla\  between  the  mouths  of  the 
Boroldai  and  Badam,  and  there  are  salt  beds  with  glasswort  {salicornia 
herbacea\  at  an  altitude  of  about  1,700  feet,  on  Lake  Ak-Kul  and  the 
River  Kuyuk.  Min-buum^  or  soda  ash,  is  probably  obtained  from 
saltwort  {salsola  kali).  Four  or  five  men  in  Kohistan  in  the  three 
winter  months  make  16  cwt.  of  alum,  that  is  sold  wholesale  at  from 
;^20  to  £2^  per  ton. 

t  All  the  deposits  of  salt  in  Turkistan  fall  under  the  two  categories  of 


53^  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

cultivated  and  settled,  the  bulk  of  the  people  procuring 
a  wretched  subsistence  by  a  small  amount  of  agriculture, 
and  pasturing  cattle  on  the  mountain  sides.*  Of  the 
land  under  cultivation  in  1872,  two-fifths  were  given 
equally  to  winter  wheat  and  barley,  and  the  remaining 
fifth  to  summer  wheat. 

The  climate  of  Kohistan  is  fairly  temperate,  the 
cold  rarely  exceeding  5^  or  the  heat  88°'25.f  Speak- 
ing generally,  the  climate  at  Ura-Tiube,  Jizakh,  Samar- 
kand, and  Katte  Kurgan,  though  all  lying  considerably 
south,  yet,  in  consequence  of  their  higher  altitude,  enjoy 
a  similar  climate  to  that  of  Tashkend. 

Epidemics  are  rare  in  the  Zarafshan  province,  as 
indeed  in  Turkistan  generally.  *  A  well-known  ende- 
mic disease  that  interested  me  was  the  leprosy.  It 
is    marked   by  the  appearance  on  the  body  (at  first, 

rock  and  lake  salts.  Of  five  known  localities  with  rock  salt,  one 
deposit  near  Khojend  is  found  in  the  midst  of  gypsum.  It  is  pure  and 
crystalline,  analogous  in  colour  and  composition  to  the  gruttsalz  of 
Cracow.  The  natives  work  the  deposits,  but  only  on  a  limited  scale. 
Salt  of  the  second  category  is  obtained  from  lakes  in  the  neighbourhood 
of  Viemy,  Kuldja,  Aulie-Ata,  and  many  others. 

♦  According  to  the  Turkistan  Kalendar  for  1880,  the  population  of 
the  mountain  districts  consisted  of  25,565  males  and  18,617  females. 
Of  these,  672  were  Russian  troops.  Divided  according  to  creeds,  there 
were  in  the  district  540  Orthodox,  2  Dissenters,  15  Romanists,  2  Pro* 
testants,  12  Jews,  41  Hindus,  and  the  remainder  were  Muhammadans. 

t  Spring  begins  in  the  middle  of  February,  and  lasts  to  the  15th 
April ;  summer  and  autumn  linger  on  to  the  middle  of  November,  or 
even  December.  The  climate  is  dry,  and  there  blows  in  summer  an 
east,  and  in  winter  a  west,  wind.  The  dusty  gharmsol  sometimes  visits 
the  valley  and  injures  the  crops,  but  storms  are  very  rare.  The 
temperature  at  Samarkand  attains  to  a  greater  range,  the  cold  having- 
descended  to  2°*66  in  February,  and  risen  to  64° '22  in  the  June  before 
my  visit. 

X  In  1872  cholera  began  in  India,  and  passed  through  Persia  to 
Bokhara,  whence  it  entered  Russian  territory  by  way  of  Samarkand 
and  Jizakh  to  Tashkend,  and  spread  along  the  great  postal-road  north- 
wards, but  not  further  east  than  Aulie-Ata.  It  lasted  five  summer 
months,  and  of  1,556  persons  attacked,  36  per  cent,  died.

for  instance,  on  the  hands  or  feet)  of  spots  of  a  milky- 
white  colour,  and  by  the  general  enfeeblement  of  the 
organism.  The  disease,  of  which  the  two  kinds  are 
distinguished  as  makhau  and  pis,  is  said  to  be  con- 
tagious, and  those  who  are  suffering  from  it  are  con- 
demned (as  under  the  Levitical  law.  Numb.  x.  2, 
Lev.  xiii.  46)  to  live  in  hamlets  apart,  communication 
with  them,  according  to  Kostenko,  being  strictly  for- 
bidden. No  objection,  however,  was  raised  to  my 
visiting  the  Tuakhau  or  lepers*  hamlet  at  Khokand,  and 
I  found  that  some  of  the  lepers  resorted  continually  to 
the  bazaar,  to  support  themselves  and  their  afflicted 
fellows  by  asking  alms.* 

In  the  Khokand  village  their  state  was  pitiable  indeed. 
Sixteen  men  and  six  women  were  living  in  mud  huts, 
in  the  depths  of  poverty,  with  no  doctor  coming  near. 
My  companion,  Mr.  Sevier,  being  a  physician,  was,  of 
course,  particularly  interested  in  our  visit.  The  first 
case  we  looked  at  was  that  of  a  boy  with  leprosy  in 
the  atrophic  stage,  with  his  face  a  mass  of  sores,  and  his 
eyes  positively  eaten  out.  The  sockets  were  running 
over  with  pus,  and  a  more  revolting  sight  I  think  I 

*  Dr.  Haughton,  of  Dublin,  has  visited  the  leper  hospitals  at  Bergen 
to  study  leprosy,  and  he  tells  me  that  the  popular  opinion  is  that  the 
disease  is  contagious ;  the  scientific  opinion — that  it  is  hereditary. 
With  this  latter  he  concurs,  especially  after  consulting  Demerara  phy- 
sicians having  great  experience  of  leprosy  in  the  West  Indies  and  South 
America,  where  it  is  more  deadly  than  in  Europe  or  Asia.  Dr.  Haughton 
speaks  of  "  two  houses  for  incurables  and  one  for  curables  "  at  Bergen, 
in  1864;  but  when  I  was  there  in  1876,  I  wrote:  "250  patients — all 
incurable*';  for  in  no  case  had  they  then  been  successful.  They  did 
indeed  point  out  one  boy  of  seven,  who  entered  with  a  tiny  spot  of  leprosy, 
and  who  they  thought  in  20  years  might  be  cured.  So  far  as  I  am  able 
to  judge,  I  should  think  that  the  care  bestowed  upon  the  Bergen  lepers 
kept  them  longer  alive,  so  that  in  the  hospital  were  seen  examples  of 
the  disease  in  more  advanced  stages  than  I  happened  to  meet  with  in 
Asia  ;  but  there  were  certain  resemblances  in  both.

never  saw.  The  poor  boy's  chief  care  seemed  to  be 
to  keep  off  the  flies  from  his  sores.  He  was  born 
of  leprous  parents,  who  had  brought  him  thither  and 
abandoned  him.  In  a  second  case  the  eyes  of  the 
sufferer  protruded,  and  in  a  third  the  knuckles  were 
cramped.  A  woman,  whom  we  saw,  had  a  discoloured 
face,  and  in  a  young  girl  the  disease  was  seen  in  the 
skin  being  tightly  stretched  over  the  nose.  In  another 
woman,  with  a  white  patch,  was  seen  what  Mr.  Sevier 
called  anaesthetic  leprosy  ;  whilst,  lastly,  a  man  seized 
eight  months  previously  in  his  hands,  saw  them 
gradually  growing  like  claws  from  contraction  of  the 
skin.  This  was  one  of  the  saddest  visits  I  paid  in 
Turkistan,  and  it  is  much  to  be  hoped  that  some 
benevolent  Russians  ere  this  may  have  attempted 
something  for  the  mitigation  of  the  sufferings,  even  if 
it  be  impossible  to  effect  the  cure,  of  Turkistan  lepers. 
On  account  of  their  alienation,  the  stricken  folk  are 
deprived  of  nearly  all  civil  advantages ;  they  live  for 
the  most  part  on  alms,  marry  only  among  themselves, 
and  bring  into  the  world  children  who  are  lepers  like 
themselves.  As  soon  as  the  news  reaches  the  makhau 
of  another  stricken  person,  a  deputation  immediately 
proceeds  to  demand  that  the  afflicted  one  should  be 
sent  to  the  marked  hamlet.  Hither  poor  persons  are 
forcibly  exiled,  but  the  rich  sometimes  buy  themselves 
off  by  a  yearly  payment  of  from  ;^5  to  ;^io.  Even 
this,  however,  would  not  seem  always  to  be  feasible, 
for  one  stricken  man  at  Khokand  told  me,  as  a  proof 
of  his  former  prosperity,  that  he  had  three  wives,  but 
when  taken  sick  he  was  driven  away  from  home  to  his 
present  position  with  one  wife  and  child.* 

*  At  Bokhara  there  is  a  lepers'  hamlet  with,  it  is  said,  500  huts.     In 
the  Tashkend  makhau  are  31  adult  sufferers  ;  at  Ura-Tiube  20.     I  do 


THE  ZARAFSHAN  PROVINCE.  541 

The  valley  of  the  Zarafshan  is  full  of  ethnological 
interest,  its  peoples  being  at  least  eight  in  number — 
namely,  Tajiks,  Uzbegs,  Persians,  Jews,  Hindus, 
Bohemians,  Afghans,  and  Arabs.  Of  these  the  Tajiks 
are  the  aboriginal  inhabitants  of  the  country,  and  are 
divided  into  Tajiks  of  the  plains,  who  have  become 
more  or  less  mingled  with  the  new-comers,  and  the 
ethnologically  purer  Tajiks  of  the  mountains.  M. 
Ujfalvy  has  minutely  described  them  both.*  The  Tajiks 
of  the  Kohistan  mountains  are  in  disposition  as  frank 
and  honest  as  the  Tajiks  of  the  plain  are  untruthful. 
The  inhabitants  of  Karategin,  Darwaz,  Shignan,  and 
Badakshan  are  said  to  be  one  and  the  same  people 
with  the  Galtchas.  They  speak  dialects  of  Persian, 
and  seem   to  have  been  driven  to  the  mountains  of 

not  know  the  date  of  these  statistics,  but  the  Turkistan  Kalendar  for 
1880  gives  the  number  of  lepers  at  Samarkand  suffering  from  pis  137, 
and  7nakhau  22,  with  55  non-leprous  persons  living  in  the  village. 
The  community,  owning  25  acres  of  land  and  31  stone  huts,  were  all 
dependent  on  alms,  except  two  small  shopkeepers,  a  blacksmith,  and 
apprentice.  The  total  number  of  lepers  in  the  province  was  219,  of 
whom  only  4  families  lived  by  agriculture,  and  i  by  trade. 

*  The  Tajik  of  the  plain,  he  says,  is  tall,  moderately  stout,  the  skin 
w^hite  (the  covered  parts  of  the  Tajik  women,  however,  being  not  so 
white  as  with  the  Kirghese),  or  tanned  by  the  sun,  not  very  hairy,  though 
seldom  smooth.  The  hair  is  black,  brown,  red,  sometimes  light,  glossy, 
wavy,  and  curled.  The  beard,  with  rare  exceptions,  is  abundant,  black, 
seldom  reddish,  but  often  brown,  and  sometimes  verging  towards  fair. 
Their  eyes,  never  turned  up  at  the  comers,  are  brown,  green,  and  some- 
times blue.  The  nose  is  usually  very  handsome,  long,  arched,  and 
slender ;  the  lips  thin,  straight,  or  but  little  turned  out ;  teeth  small 
and  sound.  The  forehead  is  high  and  wide,  superciliary  protuberances 
pronounced ;  the  transversal  depression  separating  the  nose  from  the 
glabella  is  deep ;  the  eyebrows  arched,  ample,  and  often  joined ;  the 
mouth  medium ;  chin  oval ;  the  face,  as  a  whole,  oval  or  round ;  the 
ears  medium,  or  small,  and  flattened,  rarely  standing  out.  The  body 
is  vigorous  and  well  formed,  and  the  extremities,  without  being  large, 
are  larger  than  those  of  the  Uzbegs.  The  toes  are  small,  calf  little 
developed,  the  legs  fairly  straight,  the  waist  slender,  the  trunk  fairly 
vigorous,  and  the  neck  strong.  They  are  sometimes  inclined  to  be 
stout,  only  the  fat  is  never  flabby,  as  with  the  Turko-Mongols. 


542  RUSSIA!^  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Central  Asia,  as  were  the  Britons  into  Wales.  They 
even  explain  the  name  Galtcha  as  signifying  **a  hungry 
raven  driven  to  exist  in  the  mountains."  * 

The  government  of  the  Galtchas  under  the  Russians 
is  almost  purely  democratic.  Each  village  has  its  elder, 
who  bends  to  the  decisions  of  the  majority.  The 
people t  are  divided  into  two  classes,  the  mullahs,  or 
educated,  and  the  poor.  Their  old  silver  coin  was  the 
khokand  (worth  8rf.),  but  Russian  silver  and  copper 
coins  circulate  also,  though  only  the  well-to-do  venture 
to  take  paper  money.  The  commerce  of  Kohistan  is 
almost  exclusively  with  Penjakend  and  Samarkand. 

*  A  similar  case  with  the  conquered  is  seen  in  the  inhabitants  of  the 
vale  of  Siddim  (Gen.  xiv.  lo),  and  in  the  Danites,  who  were  forced  into 
the  mountain  (Judges  i.  34).  Lot,  in  time  of  danger,  was  warned  to 
escape  thither  (Gen.  xix.  17),  and  the  Christians  of  Judea,  also,  to  flee 
to  the  mountains  (Matt.  xxiv.  16). 

t  In  their  domestic  life,  when  a  child  comes  into  the  world,  the 
parents  give  a  feast ;  the  mother  does  not  get  up  for  five  or  six  days,  and 
when  a  week  old  the  child  receives  a  name  in  the  presence  of  a  mullah, 
reminding  one  of  the  law  of  circumcision  on  the  8th  day  (Gen.  xvii.  12), 
and  the  feast  given  when  Isaac  was  weaned  (xxi.  8).  (This  feast  is  still 
given  at  circumcision  in  Central  Asia,  but  when  the  parents  are  poor 
they  frequently  defer  the  ceremony.)  Galtcha  wives  are  bought,  and  at 
the  conclusion  of  the  purchase  a  feast  is  given.  When  sick  they  have 
recourse  both  to  medicaments  and  exorcism,  over  which  latter  the 
mullah  presides.  When  a  man  dies  he  is  wrapped  in  a  mat,  placed  in 
a  trench,  and  covered  with  branches  and  earth.  The  graves  are  very 
small.  On  returning  from  a  burial  the  family  gives  a  feast,  and  then 
goes  into  mourning.  The  widow  may  marry  again  after  two  months 
and  ten  days.  Paternal  authority  is  exceedingly  severe,  and  hospitality 
is  sacred,  each  Galtcha  village  having  a  house  for  the  accommodation  of 
strangers.  Morality  is  said  to  stand  high  among  them  ;  the  adulterer 
being  turned  out  of  his  house,  and  his  goods  confiscated  by  the  Kazi. 
The  women  rarely  go  out.  *'  She  has  nothing  to  go  out  of  the  house 
for,"  said  an  old  Tajik  to  M.  Ujfalvy  ;  **  she  has  enough  to  do  to  busy 
her  indoors."  Polygamy  is  allowed,  but  the  Galtchas  seldom  have 
more  than  one  wife.  They  live  according  to  Mussulman  law ;  the  widow 
inherits  an  eighth,  the  sons  two-thirds  of  the  remainder,  and  daughters 
one-third.  An  oath  is  admitted  and  taken  upon  the  Koran  in  presence 
of  a  judge.     Slavery  appears  never  to  have  existed  among  them.     They 


THE  ZARAFSHAN  PROVINCE,  543 

Of  some  of  the  other  people  of  the  Zarafshan 
province  I  may  say  less,  because  I  shall  be  able  here- 
after to  describe  them  to  greater  advantage  when  stay- 
ing in  their  midst.  The  Persians  are  descended  from 
prisoners  brought  hither  by  the  Emir  of  Bokhara  after 
the  taking  of  Merv  in  the  middle  of  the  last  century. 
The  Bohemians,  or  gypsies,  are  divided  into  Luli 
and  Mazangs.  The  Luli  number  about  1,000  souls, 
are  wanderers,  like  their  confreres  in  Europe,  and  as 
dark  or  darker  in  complexion.  They  are  above  the 
medium  height,  and  some  of  them  look  veritable 
iathletes.  They  set  up  little  tents  of  white  linen,  and 
busy  themselves,  as  in  Europe,  with  making  baskets, 
etc.  The  Mazangs  are  an  enigmatical  race,  that  some 
assimilate  to  the  Bohemians,  whilst  others  make  them 
the  aborigines  of  the  Turks  of  Constantinople.  They 
are  not  so  tall  as  the  Lulis,  but  are  good-looking,  and 
compare  advantageously  with  the  Tajiks  in  possessing 

eat  thrice  daily,  use  birch -brooms  to  cleanse  their  houses,  and  employ 
linseed  to  make  a  paste  to  serve  for  candles,  which  they  place  in  pieces 
of  wood.  They  bum  also  in  wooden  lampstands  a  kind  of  resin,  found 
in  the  country  precipitated  on  the  rocks.  Homed  cattle,  horses,  goats, 
and  fat- tailed  sheep  are  raised  among  them,  and  they  keep  watch-dogs. 
They  now  and  then  smoke  tobacco  mixed  with  the  narcotic  nacha^  and 
frequently  take  snuff.  The  Galtchas  never  dance,  though  the  men  play 
the  guitar-like  doutar^  and  the  women  a  similar  instrument  called 
tchilmanda^  and  both  sing  monotonous  and  melancholy  songs.  The 
physical  as  well  as  moral  characteristics  of  the  Galtchas  differ, 
M.  Ujfalvy  says,  from  those  of  their  brethren  in  the  plains.  The  skin 
is  very  hairy,  the  eyes  oftener  blue,  and  the  space  between  them  very 
narrow.  The  teeth  are  often  worn  with  eating  dry  fruit.  The  hands 
and  feet  are  larger  than  those  of  the  ordinary  Tajiks,  and  this  is  still 
more  apparent  by  comparison  with  those  of  the  Kirghese  and  Tatars. 
They  are  very  robust,  excellent  walkers,  good  horsemen,  and  able  to 
undergo  great  fatigue.  They  suffer  from  ophthalmia,  some  from  stone, 
and  there  are  whole  villages  affected  with  rheumatism  in  the  bones  that 
is  attributed  to  a  mixture  they  drink  of  milk  curdled  with  a  certain  root. 
The  Galtchas  are  divided  into  six  tribes — the  Magians,  Kshtuts, 
Falghars,  Matchas,  Fans,  and  the  Yagnabs. 


544  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

greater  fineness  and  elegance  in  the  general  structure 
of  the  body.  The  skin  is  not  so  dark  as  with  the 
gypsies  in  Europe.  Those  of  the  Zarafshan  valley 
have  become  almost  sedentary.  They  profess  Muham- 
madanism,  and  speak  Persian  and  Turki.  The  poor 
are  idle,  and  given  to  nefarious  occupations  ;  the  women 
practise  medicine,  and  seek  to  meddle  in  households 
with  a  view  to  gain.  Both  classes  of  gypsy  women 
have  the  right  to  go  unveiled,  and  the  Mazang  females 
enjoy  anything  but  a  good  reputation.  The  Afghans 
that  are  met  in  the  towns  of  Central  Asia  busy  them- 
selves in  commerce  and  industry  ;  but  though  Mussul- 
mans, they  are  not  regarded  with  a  friendly  eye  by 
reason  of  their  rudeness  and  the  violence  of  their 
character.  In  the  neighbourhood  of  Samarkand  and 
Katte  Kurgan  are  from  2,000  to  3,000  Arabs  leading 
a  semi-nomad  life,  descended  from  the  conquerors, 
who  came  to  Central  Asia  in  the  ninth  century. 

With  regard  to  the  number  of  population  in  the 
Zarafshan  province,  I  was  able  to  procure  nothing  new 
during  my  stay,  the  authorities  telling  me  that  on 
account  of  the  small  proportion  of  Russians,  and  the 
untrustworthiness  of  native  figures,  it  was  exceedingly 
difficult  to  obtain  statistics.  From  the  Turkistan 
Annual  for  1876  I  gather  that  in  1872  there  were  in 
the  three  districts  of  Samarkand,  Penjakend,  and 
Katte  Kurgan,  in  round  numbers,  215,000  native  in- 
habitants (119,000  men  and  96,000  women).*  Most 
of  the  Zarafshan  towns  are  connected  by  well-made

Uzbegs,  140,154;  Persians,  2,211 ;  Hindus,  214;  Jews,  1,974;  or  divided 
by  grades,  thus : — Mullahs,  7,690 ;  merchants,  9,593  ;  artisans,  28,865  ; 
agriculturists,  95,429 ;  and  labourers,  73,986.  They  possess  5,000 
domiciles,  beside  180  inns,  30  schools,  2,001  mosques,  990  mills,  500 
stamping-mills,  or  presses,  and  32  markets.    The  numbers  of  beasts  in

is  another  with  good  stations  and  even  stone  bridges  to 
Katte  Kurgan.  There  is  likewise  a  military  road  from 
Samarkand  to  Penjakend,  and  other  roads  to  Karshi, 
Shahr-i-sabz,  and  Urgut.  Most  of  these  are  carriage- 
able, but  even  the  byways  in  the  Zarafshan  province 
are  relatively  better  than  in  other  parts  of  Turkistan. 

And  now,  having  indicated  the  roads  of  the  province, 
I  shall  next  show  how  I  proceeded  to  the  capital. 

the  province  were — camels,  i,6oo ;  horses  and  asses,  46,000  ;  horned 
cattle,  61,000 ;  and  sheep,  136,000.  Once  more,  the  principal  crops  were 
rice,  wheat,  bariey,  and  lucerne,  sown  and  reaped  as  follows  : —

with  10,200.

KHOKAND,  though  called  **the  charming,"  was 
voted  by  the  few  Russian  officials  we  found 
living  there  as  exceedingly  dull.  Moreover,  though 
the  situation  of  the  city  is  pleasant,  and  on  three  rivers, 
yet  the  water  is  naught,  or,  worse  still,  is  supposed  to 
be  a  principal  cause  of  goitre.  In  the  town  of  Khokand 
and  some  of  the  adjoining  villages  this  disease,  called 
by  the  natives  bukak,  and  by  the  Arabians  siluy  is 
remarkable  for  its  exaggerated  form,  and  attacks  not 
only  human  beings,  but  horses,  horned  cattle,  and 
dogs.  It  is  worthy  of  observation,  however,  that 
there  are  quarters  of  the  city  where  goitre  scarcely 
exists.  There  are  others  where,  out  of  three  inhabitants, 
one  will  be  afflicted  with  it.  Khokand  goitre  does  not 
produce  any  acute  suffering.     In  the  majority  of  cases 


FROM  KHOKAND  TO  SAMARKAND,  547 

it  gives  rise  to  a   slight  swelling,    and   only  in   rare 
cases  assumes  monstrous  proportions. 

On  the  occupation  of  Khokand  by  the  Russians, 
goitre  began  to  appear  among  their  troops,  which  led 
them  to  study  the  local  causes  producing  the  disease  ;  * 
and  since  the  town  engendered  other  diseases  also, 
especially  fevers,  it  was  decided  to  transfer  the 
administration  and  the  major  portion  of  the  troops 
to  Marghilan,  which  has  now  become  the  Russian 
capital. 

There  was  no  necessity  for  me  to  go  there,  since  I 
had  seen  the  Governor,  General  Abramoff,  at  Tash- 
kend,  and  had  given  to  him  books  for  the  supply  of 
the  hospitals  and  prisons  of  Ferghana;  so  I  accord- 
ingly prepared  on  Monday  morning,  September  25th, 
after   a  pleasant .  stay  with  our  gentlemanly  host,  to 

*  The  investigations  were  published  in  the  Turkistan  Gazette  for  1877, 
Nos.  II  and  12.  The  causes  were  traced,  as  was  supposed,  to  local 
miasma,  acting  on  the  organism  through  tainted  water  and  air.  The 
abundant  deposits  of  organic  decayed  matter,  which  might  perhaps  be 
combined  with  lime  and  magnesia,  would  serve,  it  was  thought,  for  the 
generation  of  the*  miasma.  Chemical  analysis  of  the  Khokand  waters 
showed  them  to  contain  enormous  quantities  of  organic  matter  and 
lime — the  first,  presumably,  from  the  neighbouring  rice  fields,  and  the 
second  from  the  numerous  town  graveyards.  The  miasma,  too,  would 
be  spread  the  more  by  the  high-lying  condition  of  the  sub-surface 
water,  often  not  more  than  28  inches  deep. 

According  to  M.  Shalgin,  who  was  appointed  to  study  the  matter, 
and  who  suggested  remedies,  goitre  especially  attacks  persons  of  a 
lymphatic  and  scrofulous  tendency,  whose  blood  is  in  a  poor  condition, 
and  those  who  live  in  damp  places.  Russian  doctors  treat  goitre 
by  outward  application  of  iodine ;  but  the  natives  affect  to  cure  it  by 
means  of  medicine  they  call  chant-dart,  produced  from  a  marine  plant, 
of  which  the  principal  element  is  iodine,  and  is  used  in  infusions,  pilules, 
and  powders,  or  the  leaf  is  sometimes  sucked  for  about  40  days,  and  the 
saliva  swallowed.  Another  remedy  for  goitre  employed  by  the  local 
doctors  {tabids)  is  bikhe-ntarjany  a  red  polypus  or  coral,  ground  to 
powder.  Sulphur  is  likewise  used,  mixed  with  powdered  coral  and 
amber.  The  natives  procure  the  marine  plant  and  coral  from  the  Red 
Sea,  of  pilgrims  returning  from  Mecca.

drive  260  miles  to  Samarkand.  Our  belongings  were 
soon  packed,  the  weightier  now  by  reason  of  a  Kho- 
kandian  suit  of  mail  that  had  been  presented  me,  and 
which,  with  the  native  boots  from  Kashgar,  the  cham- 


bar  or  leather  trousers  from  Tashkend,  and  a  helmet 
of  mail  and  battle-axe  subsequently  procured  at 
Bokhara,  made  me  a  striking  suit  for  a  member  of 
the  Church  Militant.  Leaving  M.  Ushakoff  at  10 
o'clock,  a  djiguitt   piloted  our  carriage   through  riie

labyrinth  of  streets  to  the  city  boundary,  beyond 
which  we  continued  through  the  walled  gardens  of 
the  suburbs,  on  a  fine  morning,  with  snow  mountains 
on  the  distant  horizon.  At  Bish-Aryk'  they  seemed  to 
have  received  no  notice  of  our  coming,  but  we  obtained 
horses,  and  by  eight  in  the  evening  arrived  at  Kara- 
Chukum.  Here  we  had  to  wait  three  hours  for  steeds, 
which  gave  us  opportunity  to  walk  through  the  village, 
and  to  see  people  arranging  themselves  to  sleep  in  the 
street,*  some  under  a  platform  of  the  tiny  bazaar,  and 
some  on  couches,  whilst  others,  apparently  travellers, 
simply  spread  a  garment  or  cloth  and  lay  on  the 
ground.  One  man,  a  late  worker,  was  winding  cotton 
by  hand  for  making  stockings,  but  many  more  were 
busy  with  a  large  saucepan  preparing  supper. 

We  left  about  midnight,  and  early  in  the  morn- 
ing reached  Khojend.  This  was  by  far  the  oldest 
Central  Asian  city  we  had  seen,  and  dated  at  least 
as  far  back  as  the  fourth  century  before  the  Christian 
era.  It  was  called  the  Alexandria  of  the  north, 
and  perhaps  marks  the  farthest  point  northward  of 
Alexander's  conquests.  Since  his  days  the  town  has 
changed  masters  many  a  time  and  oft.  Chinese, 
Arabs,  Persians,  Mongols,  and  Turks  have  each 
poured  out  their  blood  in  assaulting  or  defending  it.f 

*  Illustrating  the  naturalness  of  the  expression  of  the  two  angels  who 
said  to  Lot,  "  Nay,  but  we  will  abide  in  the  street  all  night  *'  (Gen.  xix. 
2) ;  also  the  primitive  state  of  things  with  Job,  who  could  say,  **  The 
stranger  did  not  lodge  in  the  street,  but  I  opened  my  doors  to  the 
traveller"  (Job  xxxi.  32);  and  the  want  of  hospitality  in  the  lawless 
days  of  the  judges,  when  the  Levite  and  his  concubine  were  allowed  for 
a  time  to  sit  down  in  the  street  of  Gibeah,  for  no  man  took  them  in  to 
lodge  them  (Judges  xix.  15). 

t  Khojend,  with  Ura-Tiube,  Jizakh,  and  the  country  round,  for  many 
years  formed  a  separate  state,  governed  by  independent  Beks.  In  the 
beginning  of  the  eighteenth  century  Khojend  was  fortified,  and  the 
city  divided  into  24  wards.     Early  in  the  present  century  it  was  taken, 


550  jRrSS/AA'  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Khojend  is  bounded  on  two  sides  by  the  SjT-daria, 
and  on  three  sides  by  gardens  and  ploughed  fields. 
On  the  south-west  these  stretch  for  nearly  5  miles^ 
and  on  the  east  still  further.  The  walls,  double  on 
three  sides  and  single  near  the  Syr.  form  an  irregular 
polygon,  with  a  circumference  of  about  8  miles,  the 
town  being  entered  by  8  gates  and  several  small  exits.* 

Our  host  the  Xachalnik  complained  of  the  intensity 
of  the  summer  heat  at  Khojend.  For  June,  July, 
and  August  the  average  temperature  is  about  84*20% 
and  the  dust  brought  by  the  wind  from  the  Steppe 
fills  the  air,  and  renders  it  very  oppressive.  The 
winter  is  milder  than  at  Tashkend,  the  Syr  here  being 
hardly  ever  frozen.  The  wall  of  the  Mogol-Tau» 
4,000  feet  high,  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  river, 
helps  to  intensify  the  heat,  sheltering  the  town  from 
the  north  wind,  and  absorbing  and  refracting  the  sun's 
rays.  Summer,  too,  is  longer  than  at  Tashkend,  and 
Khojend  fruits  are  ripe  a  fortnight  before  those  of 
Tashkend,  Ura-Tiube,  or  Jizakh. 

The  trade  industry  of  Khojend  is  represented  by 

as  I  have  said,  by  Alim-Kul,  ruler  of  Khokand,  and  from  that  time  till 
the  invasion  of  the  Russians  the  town  was  a  constant  apple  of  discord 
between  Bokhara  and  Khokand.  The  name  is  alleged  by  some  to  be 
derived  from  Khojianda^  sl  daughter  of  Adam,  by  whom  the  inhabit- 
ants say  the  town  was  founded,  and  in  accordance  with  which  they 
claim  that  it  is  the  most  ancient  in  all  Central  Asia.  Others  say  the 
name  was  corrupted  to  its  present  form  from  Khopchiant,  or  built  on  a 
beautiful  place.  A  third  and  more  reasonable  derivation  is  that  of 
Khoja  and  Kend,  or  "the  abode  of  Khojas,"  and  there  really  is  of 
them  an  extraordinary  number  in  the  town. 

♦  The  24  ancient  wards  were  subsequently  divided  into  80  mahalas, 
which  still  exist,  named  after  their  respective  canals.  Khojend  is  now 
divided  into  the  Rozaky  or  western,  and  the  JCalinaus,  or  eastern 
quarters,  with  2,800  and  3,000  respectively  of  squalid  houses.  The  popu- 
lation is  28,000,  all  Tajiks,  except  about  100  Uzbegs,  50  Kashgarians, 
30  Jews,  and  7  Hindus.  The  gardens  of  Khojend,  apart  from  those 
on  the  outskirts,  are  computed  to  cover  350  acres,  and  in  the  way  of 
buildings  the  town  may  be  called  remarkable,  inasmuch  as  it  possesses 


FROM  KHOKAND  TO  SAMARKAND, 


551 


1,141  shops  for  work  and  sale,  between  which  it  is 
not  easy  to  distinguish  in  Central  Asia,  because  in  the 
majority  of  cases  the  person  who  makes  the  goods 
is  he  who  sells  them.  Silk-dyeing  and  cotton-weaving 
are  the  two  most  important  trades.  There  are  5 
caravansaries  in  the  town,  one  being  for  Jews  and 
Hindus,  and  2  bazaars — the  larger  with  510,  and 
the  smaller  with  280  shops.  The  greater  proportion 
of  these  are  open  only  on  market  days — that  is, 
Wednesdays,  Thursdays,  and  Fridays. 

It  was  Tuesday  when  we  passed  through  the  bazaar 
on  our  return  journey,  and  as  it  was  very  early  in  the 
morning  we  thought  it  better  not  to  call  on  the 
Nachalnik,  but  ask  for  horses  to  proceed  imme- 
diately. We  had  now  made  83  riiiles  from  Khojend, 
and  had  before  us  181  miles  more,  with  11  stations 
to  Samarkand.*    From  Nau,  where  was  a  mud  fortress, 

3  medresses,  constructed  of  kiln-burnt  bricks.  Of  these  one  is  150 
years  old,  the  others  40  and  50  years  respectively.  All  are  called  after 
the  individuals  who  built  them.  There  are,  besides,  several  mud-built 
medresses,  one  of  them  erected  as  long  ago  as  200  years ;  and  one, 
about  150  years  old,  was  almost  rebuilt  20  years  ago,  at  the  public 
expense,  this  mosque  being  almost  the  only  fine  specimen  of  Central  Asian 
architecture  now  existing.  It  is  called  Hazret-Sheikh-Muslak-ed-din, 
in  honour  of  the  sainted  personage  whose  name  it  bears,  and  who 
was  a  protector  of  the  town  of  Khojend.  There  are  in  the  town,  in  all, 
24  medresses,  with  530  students,  and  40  schools  with  160  scholars ; 
most  of  them  attended,  however,  only  in  winter.  The  total  number  of 
mosques  is  202  (47  of  them  being  great  mosques),  in  which  prayers  are 
said  on  Fridays ;  and  the  spiritual  persons  attached  to  the  mosques 
number  232.     There  are  15  cemeteries  within  the  city  bounds.

552  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

we  sent  back  a  message  of  thanks  to  Colonel  Putimsoff 
for  kindly  arranging  about  our  horses,  and  then  break- 
fasted, by  way  of  fortifying  ourselves  for  the  longest 
postal   stage   I   think   I   ever  took  in  Russia  without- 
changing  horses.     It  is  marked  in  the  post-book  27 
miles,  but  the  driver  declared  it  was  33  ;    I  believed 
him,  and  hired  four  horses,  and  they  gave  us  another 
into  the  bargain,  so  that  we  drove  off  with  two  leaders 
under   a  postilion,  and  a  troika.     For   about    twenty 
miles  the  landscape  presented  nothing  but  an  extensive 
desert,  with  scarcely  a  tree  to  be  seen.    Then  appeared 
an  oasis  here  and  there,   and   cultivation   came   into 
view  with  fields  of  standing  com.      During   all    the 
stage  we  met  but  one  yemstchik,  and  few  caravans, 
but  saw  a  man  ploughing  with  oxen.     This  dreary 
drive  took  us  the  greater  part  of  the   day,  and   we 
were  not  sorry,  late  in  the  afternoon,  to  come  within 
sight  of  the  picturesque  fortress  of  Ura-Tiube. 

Ura-Tiube,  or  Ora-Tippa,  is  a  city  set  on  a  hill  2,700 
feet  above  the  sea.  The  commandant  was  Colonel 
Vaulin.  With  much  ado  we  got  them  to  drag  the 
carriage  up  to  his  house,  where  he  was  expecting  us, 
and  received  us  heartily.  He  kindly  gave  us  some 
dinner,  and  seemed  thoroughly  to  participate  in  our 
enjoyment,  for  so  dull  was  the  place,  there  being  only 
five  persons  in  it  to  constitute  ** society, "that  he  seemed 
as  pleased  with  our  visit  as  were  we.  The  view  from 
the  terrace  before  the  ColoneFs  house  was  one  of  the 
most  extensive  we  saw  in  Central  Asia.  The  town  is 
situated  at  the  foot  of  two  eminences,  one  being  sur- 
mounted by  the  citadel,  whilst  on  the  slopes  of  the 
other  lies  the  north-western  portion  of  the  town.  On 
our  right  was  the  citadel,  with  a  monument  raised  to 
the  memory  of  the  Russians  killed  in  the  siege  on  the 


FROM  KHOKAND  TO  SAMARKAND.  553 

1st  November,  1866.  The  gateway  of  the  fort  had 
been  turned  into  a  small  Russian  church.  On  our  left 
we  had  a  good  view  of  the  barracks  and  the  town, 
which  has  a  circumference  of  about  four  miles,  and  is 
encircled  by  a  double  wall* 

I  inquired  at  Ura-Tiube  concerning  the  religious 
and  moral  condition  of  the  people,  and  was  told  of 
two  adjacent  places  sacred  in  Muhammadan  eyes,  with 
traditions  attached  worthy  of  Papal  Rome.  One  was 
the  tomb  of  a  saint  about  half  a  mile  out  of  the  town, 
and  over  which  was  built  an  arch  that  in  process  of 
time  began  to  drop  in  the  centre,  whereupon,  with  a 
view  to  propping  it  up,  they  cut  no  less  than  100 
trees  in  succession,  not  one  of  which,  by  some  strange 
fatality,  would  exactly  fit ;  whereupon  the  hewers  of 
wood  decided  to  sleep  upon  it,  and  lo !  whilst  they 
slept,  the  hundred  trees  walked  off  to  Mecca,  whence 
Muhammad  sent  back  a  stone  pillar,  and  this  the 
sleepers,  on  waking,  found  erected  where  the  tree  was 
to  have  stood.  Another  saint  having  been  buried  in 
Ura-Tiube,    water    began    to    issue   from    his   grave. 

*  For  some  reason  now  unknown,  it  is  divided  into  58  unequal 
guzars^  corresponding  to  the  tnahalas  of  Khojend,  but  there  are 
hardly  any  gardens  in  the  town,  the  land  being  monopolized  by  its 
1,400  houses.  The  gardens  are  in  the  suburbs,  whither  their  proprietors 
repair  in  summer,  and  leave  the  town  almost  deserted.  Two  of  the 
medresses  are  of  kiln-burnt  bricks,  one  of  them  having  been  built,  320 
years  ago,  by  Sultan  Abdul-Latif.  The  inhabitants,  according  to 
Kostenko,  number  4,800,  of  whom  900  are  Uzbegs,  and  a  few  Jews 
and  Hindus,  but  of  no  other  races.  The  Kirghese  are  said  not  to 
come  except  to  sell  wood,  coal,,  and  cattle,  or  to  buy  such  necessities 
as  their  own  industry  is  incapable  of  producing.  There  are  850  shops 
in  the  town,  and  a  bazaar  containing  650  more.  To  judge  from  the 
Colonel's  account,  Russian  goods  are  dear.  Candles  cost  lod,  a  lb., 
a  box  of  sardines  2^*.,  and  a  box  of  caviar,  4^*.  I  had  been  specially 
counselled  to  purchase  a  fur  coat  in  Ura-Tiube,  but  the  Colonel,  on 
sending  for  us  to  the  bazaar,  could  get  nothing  better  than  common 
sheepskin  shubs  at  \os,  each. 


554  liUSSIAK  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

At  once  the  inhabitants  surrounded  the  place  with  a 
wall,  and  it  is  now  considered  holy.  The  moral  con- 
dition of  the  native  men  was  said  to  be  exceedingly 
low,  and  unnatural  crime  common.* 

Among  the  poor,  the  kalim  for  a  wife  was  only  i 
tillah,  or  ly.  4^.,  but  among  the  rich  a  bride  sometimes 
cost  40  camels,  40  horses,  40  goats,  40  sheep,  and  a  tent. 
The  girls  married  at  1 4  ;  and  though  divorce  was  very 
common  and  very  easy,  each  mullah  being  able  to  sanction 
it,  there  were  said  to  be  no  unmarried  women  in  the  place. 

Colonel  Vaulin  would  gladly  have  had  us  prolong 
our  stay,  but  it  seemed  better  to  press  on,  and  just 
as  it  became  dark  we  started  forward.  The  road  was 
good,  and,  as  we  travelled  slowly,  I  managed  to  sleep 
during  the  five  hours  we  took  to  Savat,  where,  under- 
standing that  the  next  stage  would  be  a  heavy  one, 
we  again  hired  four  horses,  and  were  given  five.  We 
thus  sped  on  during  the  night  to  Zamin,  where  once 
there  was  a  mud  fort,  and  to  Ravat,  and  by  breakfast- 
time  had  descended  to  Jizakh,  a  town  970  feet  above 
the  sea,  with  4,000  inhabitants.  Thus  far  from  Ura- 
Tiube  we  had  been  skirting  the  base  of  the  Turkistan 
range  of  mountains,  along  a  route  with  adjacent  hills. 
The  road  frequently  crossed  the  little  stream  that 
waters  Jizakh,  sometimes  keeping  along  its  lofty  loamy 
banks,  but  at  others  climbing  the  hill-side.  On  one 
of  these  latter  occasions  I  remember  noticing  a 
specimen  of  semi-nomad  life,  in  tents  pitched  near 
plots  of  cultivated  land,  and  specimens  of  rude 
weaving  laid  along  the  ground. 

^  We  heard  such  things,  in  fact,  as  to  remind  one  of  the  former  con- 
dition of  Canaan  (i  Kings  xiv.  24);  or  the  condition  for  that  matter 
of  the  ancient  Romans,  as  witnessed  to,  not  only  by  Paul,  in  Rom. 
i.  26,  I*],  but  in  the  unearthed  remains  of  Pompeii.  The  women  at 
Ura-Tiube  were  said  to  be  better,  but  very  dirty. 


FROM  KHOKAND  TO  SAMARKAND,  555 

We  passed  two  villages  lying  under  the  hill-side, 
with  flat  roofs  and  walled  yards,  and  then  entered  a 
valley  of  the  Kara-Tau  chain,  through  which  runs  the 
stream  Jizakh  just  referred  to,  whilst  the  road  leads 
through  a  defile  not  more  than  a  hundred  yards^  in 
width,  called  the  Gates  of  Tamerlane,  though  there 
appears  to  be  no  local  reason  for  the  name.  This 
important  pass  connects  the  Syr-daria  and  Zarafshan 
valleys,  and  has  witnessed  many  a  sanguinarj^  conflict 
for  the  possession  of  one  or  the  other.  On  our  right 
rose  the  scarped  cliff  some  400  feet  high,  of  a 
pyramidal  slaty  rock.  On  its  surface  are  cut  two 
Persian  inscriptions,  untranslated  in  any  book  that  I 
have  met  with,  except  that  of  Dr.  Schuyler.  The 
first  commemorates  a  campaign  to,  and  the  return  in 
safety  from,  the  country  of  the  Mongols  in  1425,  by 
Ulug-Bek,  the  celebrated  grandson  of  Tamerlane  ; 
and  the  second  informs  the  traveller  of  a  victory  in 
1 571  of  Abdullah  Khan,  who  with  30,000  men  put  to 
flight  an  army  of  400,000.  This  victory  is  attributed 
*'  to  a  fortunate  conjunction  of  the  stars,"  and  it  is 
added  that  so  many  were  killed  that  for  a  month 
blood  continued  to  run  in  the  river  to  Jizakh,  and  then 
it  concludes,  **  Let  this  be  known."  This  was  an 
instance  of  setting  up  a  memorial  for  those  who 
should  come  after,  and  amongst  the  nom^ad  Kirghese 
I  had  met,  as  I  have  said,  with  the  raising  a  heap  for 
a  similar  purpose ;  but  I  do  not  remember  meeting 
in  Central  Asia  any  exemplification  of  the  custom  of 
setting  up  great  stones,  plastering  them  with  plaster, 
and  writing  thereon.* 

On  emerging  from  the  defile  we  were  again  on  the 
steppe,  with  signs  of  irrigation,  and  of  distant  snow- 

*  Deut.  xxvni.  2. 


556  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

covered   peaks    to    the    south.     As    we    approached 
Yany- Kurgan,  we   saw  what  looked  in  the   distance 
like,  a  company  of  Cossacks  exercising,  but  on  nearer 
approach  proved  to  be  a  hundred  or  more  of  natives 
playing   their   favourite   game    of  Kok-Bari,  or  grey 
wolf.      It   was   market  day,  and    on   such    occasions, 
when    horsemen  congregate,    a  goat  or  kid  is  good- 
naturedly  seized  upon,  belonging  to  someone  well-to- 
do,  who  has  had  a  birth  in  his  family  or  some  other 
piece  of  good  fortune,  and  the  animal  is  killed.     The 
president   of    the   game   then   takes    his   position,    if 
possible,  near  some  steep  or  elevated  place,  and  hands 
the  goat  to  a  horseman,  who  dashes  down  the  slope 
at  the  risk  of  breaking  his  neck,  and  is  immediately 
pursued   by  the  field,  each  of  whom   tries  to  snatch 
away  the  goat  before  the  man  can  bring  it  back  to  the 
president.     Men  of  various  ages  were  on  the  ground, 
and  some  had  mounted  their  boys  before  them  to  see 
the  fun,  which  was  in  some  respects  not  unlike  a  game 
of  football.     The  race  goes  on  till  the  carcase  is  torn 
in  pieces,  whereupon  it  **  goes  to  pot,"  and  is  boiled 
for  a   feast.     Then   the   company   is   ready  to  seize 
another  goat  and  commence  again. 

We  passed  but  few  houses  on  the  road  to  Sarailyk, 
and  then  proceeded  across  extensive  plains,  frequently 
through  cultivation.  By  evening  we  reached  Kamenny- 
Most,  or  Stone  Bridge,  guarded  by  a  Russian  fort,  and 
beyond  this  point  descended  into  the  lower  valley  of 
the  Zarafshan,  the  road  lying  through  numerous  fields. 
We  had  now  entered,  in  fact,  one  of  the  gardens 
of  Turkistan,  the  flora  being  almost  unknown  to 
naturalists  till  fifteen  years  ago,  when  a  scientific  expe- 
dition was  sent  thither  from  Moscow  under  Professor 
A.  P.  Fedchenko.     I  shall  need  to  speak  more  fully  of 


FROM  KHOKAND   TO  SAMARKAND,  557 

this  expedition  hereafter,  but  it  will  be  interesting  to 
notice  here  certain  peculiarities  concerning  the  flora  of 
the  valley.* 

Among  useful  trees  is  Tukhmiak,  or  Sophora 
Japonica,  Although  but  four  species  are  found  in 
Samarkand,  they  are  numerous  in  Khojend  and 
Khokand.  The  flowers  in  bud  are  collected  and  dried  ; 
from  these,  by  infusion  in  cold  water,  an  excellent  yellow 
dye  is  obtained.  Another  interesting  plant  is  kanap,  by 
which  general  name  several  fibrous  plants  are  known,  t 

A  still  more  noteworthy,  and  for  a  long  time 
enigmatical,  plant  is  sumbuly  kept  so  jealously  from 
the  Russians  in  Turkistan  (as  was  the  Ginseng  in 
Manchuria),  that  Fedchenko  was  denied  access  thereto 
by  the  Bek  of  Maghian.  J 

One  more  plant  of  a  remarkable  character  is  worth 
notice  here,  called  shirish,  of  the  lily  family.  It  has  a 
smooth  stem  about  3  feet  6  inches  high,  and  an  inch  in 

•  See  Appendix  on  the  flora  of  Turkistan, 

t  Hemp  is  so  called,  for  instance,  in  Samarkand,  also  Apocynum 
sihiricum,  termed  in  Semirechia  kendyr.  One  particularly  valuable 
specimen  given  to  M.  Fedchenko  was  Hibiscus  cannabintis.  It  grew 
16  feet  high,  with  ripe  fruit  in  the  beginning  of  September.  A  special 
point  to  be  noticed  about  two  of  these  plants  is  that  the  Tukhmiak  is  a 
native  of  Japan,  and  the  Hibiscus  is  cultivated  in  India.  The  latter 
gives  excellent  fibre  for  rope  and  cord  that  has  had  hitherto  to  be  brought 
from  Russia.  The  existence,  therefore,  of  these  plants  in  Turkistan 
seems  to  prove  that  they  might  be  acclimatized  in  certain  parts  of  the 
country  for  industrial  uses,  at  least  to  supply  the  local  population  if  not 
for  export  to  Russia. 

X  M.  Borshtchofif  was  authorized  to  promise  20  half  imperials  for 
a  specimen  for  instruction,  but  the  reward  remained  for  some  time  un- 
claimed. By  close  questioning,  however,  he  ascertained  that  it  grows  in 
mountain  valleys  watered  by  over-flowing  rivers,  such  as  the  upper  courses 
of  the  Chirchik  and  Syr-daria.  Fedchenko  obtained  a  bulb  and  planted 
it  in  the  botanical  garden  of  Moscow  University,  where  it  blossomed  and 
its  fruit  ripened,  thus  rendering  possible  a  detailed  investigation  of  the 
plant,  and  rejoicing  the  heart  of  the  explorer,  who  said  that  if-  the  Bek 
of  Maghian  chose  to  go  to  Moscow  he  might  see  there  in  perfection  the

diameter,  with  a  thick  spindle-shaped  root,  the  bulbs 
resembling  those  of  the  dahlia  or  beet,  but  much  larger. 
In  autumn,  when  the  plant  becomes  ripe,  the  stems  are 
cut  off  and  dried  for  fuel ;  the  root  is  dug  up,  dried  in 
the  sun,  and  crushed,  and  the  triturated  powder,  of  a 
green-greyish  hue,  is  called  Shiriash.*  Shirish  grows 
abundantly  in  Turkistan,  and  shiriash  has  an  impor- 
tant trade  value  throughout  Central  Asia,  where  it  is 
employed  in  alabaster  works,  for  stiffening  cotton,  and 
for  thickening  certain  colours  used  in  printing  cotton 
fabrics. 

These  remarks  on  flora  have  been  suggested  by  our 
entrance  to  the  cultivated  portion  of  the  Zarafshan 
valley.  We  had  telegraphed  in  the  morning  from 
Jizakh  to  Samarkand  to  General  Korolkoff  to  inform 
him  of  our  approach,  hoping  to  finish  our  journey  that 
night ;  but  when  we  reached  Djimbai  it  was  already 
dark,  and  since  between  that  station  and  Samarkand 
we  had  to  ford  the  Zarafshan,  the  post-master  advised 
us  to  wait  till  dawn,  and  not  risk  the  danger  of  a  night 
crossing.  I  therefore  sat  up  till  midnight  writing,  so  as 
to  have  as  much  leisure  as  possible  in  the  capital,  and 
before  it  was  light  I  stirred  up  the  yemstchik  to  put  to 

plant  he  had  tried  to  keep  so  exclusively  in  his  own  mountains.  Sumbul 
\Siumbiulta)  is  a  bulbous  plant  belonging  to  the  family  Umbelliferoi^ 
and  is  considered  to  constitute  a  new  genus  approximate  to  Ferula 
and  Peucedanum.  Its  root  has  the  smell  of  Musk  and  Archangelica, 
and  is  therefore  used  as  a  cosmetic  in  the  richer  harems  of  Turkistan. 

♦  Shiriash,  if  not  identical  with,  is  very  much  like  burnt  starch, 
lustrine,  leiokum,  and  other  trade  denominations  of  dextrine  prepared 
from  starch.  The  powder  is  easily  soluble  in  cold  water,  does  not  take 
a  blue  colour  when  mixed  with  iodine,  and  is  capable  of  precipitation 
by  strong  spirit.  On  first  investigation  under  the  microscope  the  powder 
did  not  reveal  the  presence  of  an  atom  of  starch,  and  it  was  therefore 
supposed  that  the  dextrine  formed  in  the  process  of  drying ;  but  subse- 
quently dextrine  was  detected  in  the  fresh  roots — a  fact  said  to  be 
unknown  previously  to  physiologists.

the  horses.  We  started  about  four  o'clock,  and  in  the 
grey  dawn  came  to  the  banks  of  the  ** gold-strewing" 
stream,  the  fording  of  which  I  saw  was  to  be  a  more 
serious  matter  than  aught  of  the  kind  I  had  previously 
undertaken.  Not  only  is  the  stream  very  swift,  but 
the  depth  so  varies  from  day  to  day  in  different  parts 
of  the  bed  that  men  are  kept  on  the  spot  to  study  the 
river's  caprice  and  help  travellers  across.  Our  goods 
were  all  taken  out  of  the  tarantass,  and,  with  our 
two  selves,  were  placed  in  a  high  native  cart,  and 
thus,  accompanied  by  horsemen,  we  forded  the  river 
with  no  worse  mishap  than  the  falling  out  of  our  bread- 
bag,  which  was  rescued  by  one  of  the  horsemen.  The 
tarantass  was  dragged  through,  and  did  not  get  so 
soaked  as  we  feared  it  might  have  done,  so  that  we 
had  only  to  put  back  our  goods  and  proceed.  We 
passed  the  hill  of  Chupan-Ata,  and  soon  found  our- 
selves on  a  well-made  road,  with  trees  on  either 
hand.  Along  this  we  passed  to  the  palace  of  the 
Governor,  and  thus  arrived  at  the  ancient  capital  of 
the  Timurids.

WE  saw  little  or  nothing  of  antiquarian  interest 
north  of  Tashkend,  unless  it  were  a  few 
Kirghese  tombs,  not  apparently  very  old.  Nor  did 
matters  improve  much  until  we  approached  Samar- 
kand, the  one  town  of  antiquities  that  Russia  possesses 
in  the  whole  of  her  dominions. 

Its  foundation,  according  to  Khanikoff,  goes  back 
to  the  heroic  age  of  Persian  history,  and  is  attri- 
buted to  Keianide  Kei  Kaous,  son  of  Kei-Koubad. 
But,  however  this  may  be,  we  know  that  at  the  time 
of  the  invasion  of  Alexander  the  Great,  he  took 
in  Transoxiana  a  town  Maracanda,  in  329  B.C.,  which 
he  made  his  head-quarters  during  his  contests  with 
the  mountain  tribes.  It  was  here,  in  a  fit  of  drunken 
passion,  that  he  -killed  his  friend  Cleitus,  and  from 
hence  he  went  to  winter  at  Zariaspa,  which  KhanikofT 
connects  with  the  Khivan  Hazarasp.     In  Alexander's 


THE  ANCIENT  CAPITAL   OF  THE  TIMURIDS,     561 

time  Maracanda  was  said,  by  Quintus  Curtius,  to  have 
walls  eight  miles  in  circumference,  with  a  citadel 
surrounded  by  an  inner  wall.  Afterwards  it  became 
the  capital  of  Sogdiana,  one  of  the  provinces  formed 
out  of  the  ruins  of  Alexander's  monarchy. 

The  Greeks  and  Graeco-Bactrians  had  their  day, 
and  were  succeeded  by  the  Yuechji,  apparently  Steppe 
nomads,  mentioned  by  the  Chinese  General,  Chyan 
Tsian,  about  125  B.C.  At  what  date  the  valleys  of 
the  Oxus  and  Jaxartes  were  conquered  by  the  Celes- 
tials is  not  known  ;  but,  in  the  seventh  century  after 
Christ,  these  parts  of  Asia  were  considered  the  western 
provinces  of  the  Empire  of  China.  They  called  the 
town  Sie-mu-sze-kan.  The  Arabs  were  the  next  in- 
vaders, conquering  Samarkand  in  675.  The  Khalifs' 
direct  reign  lasted  until  a.d.  888,  when  the  depen- 
dent dynasty  of  the  Samanids  succeeded,  but  collapsed 
in  A.D.  1004,  to  be  followed  by  Turkish  princes  of  the 
Seljuk  dynasty. 

The  Greeks  brought  with  them  Western  ideas  and 
customs,  the  traces  of  which  have  long  since  passed 
away,  save  that  now  and  then  Graeco-Bactrian  coins 
are  found,  and  some  of  the  Tajiks  of  the  mountains 
claim  descent  from  the  Great  Iskander.  The  Arabs, 
however,  introduced  a  new  religion  and  civilization 
that  no  subsequent  vicissitudes  have  effaced.  Under 
the  Samanids,  Samarkand  became  the  home  of  peace 
and  science,  and  for  some  centuries  after  the  Mussul- 
man conquest  it  was  also  the  see  of  a  Christian  bishop. 
It  early  became  one  of  the  large  towns  of  Asia,  for 
when  the  great  Mongol  conqueror,  Jinghiz  Khan, 
overturned  the  city  in  1221,  he  was  opposed  by 
110,000  men,  about  three-fourths  of  whom  he  put 
to  the  sword.     A  quarter  of  a  century  later,  however,

the  Christians  were  said  to  be  in  a  flourishing  state,  ^ 
by  virtue  of  privileges  bestowed  on  them  by  Jinghiz 
Khan  ;  and  Marco  Polo  testifies  that  in  his  dav  there 
was  a  Christian  church  in  Samarkand. 

Jinghiz  was  succeeded  by  Mongol  heirs  for  nearly 
200  vears,  till  his  dvnastv  was  set  aside  bv  Timur, 
or  Tamerlane,  who  made  Samarkand  the  capital  of 
his  vast  dominions.  Out  of  it  he  marched  on  campaigns 
that  lasted  for  vears.  and  from  which  he  returned  with 
captives  and  spoils,  bent  on  making  his  capital  the 
finest  citv  of  the  world.  It  was  on  his  return  from 
one  of  these  campaigns,  in  1404,  that  he  received 
Don  Ruy  Gonzales  de  Clavijo  as  ambassador  from 
Henry  III.  of  Castile.  Hans  Schiltberger,  of  Munich, 
was  in  Samarkand  about  the  same  time,  though  he 
tells  us  little  or  nothing  about  the  city  ;  but  Clavijo, 
on  his  return,  wrote  such  an  account  of  his  adventures, 
and  of  the  splendour  of  Tamerlane's  court,  as  made 
Europe  marvel.  Nearly  a  hundred  years  later,  in  1497, 
when  Samarkand  had  150,000  inhabitants,  Baber, 
one  of  Timur  s  descendants,  speaks  of  its  pleasant 
situation,  saying  that  the  wall  was  10,600  paces  in 
circumference.  Two  years  later,  however,  the  Uzbegs, 
under  their  Khan  Sheibani,  seized  the  capital,  and 
once  for  all  drove  away  Timur*s  descendants.  Around 
the  standards  of  the  Sheibanids  rallied  various  Turkish 
peoples,  who  soon  acquired  ascendency  over  nearly 
all  the  Central  Asian  countries,  formerly  ruled  by  the 
Timurids  ;  and  though  they  were  somewhat  checked 
by  peoples  of  Persian  blood,  the  Uzbegs  held  in 
subjection  the  valleys  of  the  Zarafshan  till  the  coming 
of  the  Russians.  Under  the  Uzbegs,  Samarkand, 
once  the  capital  of  a  great  monarchy,  declined  to  the 
condition  of  a  barbarous  town,  and  at  the  beginning 


THE  ANCIENT  CAPITAL   OF  THE  TIMURIDS.     563 

of  the  eighteenth  century,  after   devastation   by   the 
nomads,  possessed  scarcely  any  inhabitants. 

Thus  the  site  of  Samarkand,  having  been  occupied 
for  more  than  two  thousand  years,  might  be  expected 
to  be  rich  in  objects  of  high  antiquity.     It  must  be 
remembered,    however,    that    in    remote    times    the 
inhabitants  of  the  Zarafshan  valley  lived  very    much 
in  tents,  and,  when  they  built,  did  so  with  mud  rather 
than  stone  ;  as,  for  instance,  in  Tamerlane*s  time,  when, 
on  one  occasion,  he  ordered  a  mosque  to  be  built  in 
the  space  of  ten  days.     The  most   ancient  ruins  are 
thought  to  be  those  on  the  hill  Kaleh-i-Afrasiab  in  the 
northern  outskirts  of  the  present  town.     These   are 
connected,    in   the   minds   of  the   natives,    with    the 
mythical  Turkish  hero  Afrasiab,  who  is   supposed  to 
have  fought  with  Alexander  of  Macedon,  and  to  have 
founded  Samarkand.     Another  story  is  that  the  giant 
Afrasiab,  being  unable  to    take    the  ancient   city   by 
assault,  buried  it  under  the  sand.     The  extent  of  these 
ruins,  or  rather  of  this  dreary  desert,  is  immense,  and 
presents  a  scene  of  scattered  kurgan,  or  tumuli,  and 
of  heaps  of  earth,   the  remains,  probably,  of  former 
clay  erections.     In   1875,   some   unsystematic  excava- 
tions were  made,  and  ruins  of  houses  and  an  ancient 
pottery  discovered,    including  jugs,   as    well  as  glass 
ware,  suggestive   of  Chinese   workmanship,    together 
with  coins  and   glazed    tiles.     *'  Kurgan,"    similar   to 
those  of  Afrasiab,  occur  in  various  other  places  around 
Samarkand.    Their  general  type  resembles  the  present 
style    of    Bokhariot  strongholds,     but    none    of  them 
appear  to  have  tombs,  or  remains  of  stone  buildings. 
I   should    mention,  however,    in    this    neighbourhood, 
on  the  left  bank  of  the  Zarafshan,  the  remains  of  an 
ancient  bridge,  called  the  Bridge  of  Shadman-Malik, 


564  liUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

which  I  must  have  passed,  though  I  do  not  remember 
noticing  it  near  the  hill  of  Chupan-Ata,  which  perhaps 
is  the  greatest  antiquity  of  the  neighbourhood.* 

The  chief  antiquities  to  be  seen  in  Samarkand  in 
the  present  day  date  from  the  beginning  of  the  fifteenth 
century,  and  onwards,  the  oldest  of  them  being  con- 
nected with  the  name  of  Timur.  These  include  his 
place  of  burial,  called  the  Gur-Emir,  with  that  of  his 
wife,  Bibi-Khanum,  and  another  beautiful  mosque, 
called  the  Sbah-Zindeh.  There  are  also  four  remark- 
able medresses,  called  the  Tillah-Kari,  Shir-Dar, 
Ulug-Beg,  and  Bibi-Khanum.  There  is  likewise  an- 
other object  of  interest  in  the  citadel,  where,  in  the 
reception  hall  of  the  Emir  of  Bokhara,  is  preserved 
the  ancient  koktashy  or  coronation  stone  of  Tamerlane. 

North-east  of  Samarkand,  on  the  hill  Chupan-Ata, 
called  Kohik  by  Baber,  was  built  an  observatory,  three 
stories  high,  by  Ulug-Beg,  son  of  Shah  Rukh,  and 
grandson  of  Timur,  who  provided  it  with  astronomical 
apparatus,  and  whose  memory  has  been  secured  to 
posterity  by  means  of  the  astronomical  tables  that  bear 

•  Dr.  Schuyler  and  M.  Ujfalvy  both  allude  to  it,  and  the  latter  gives 
an  engraving  shoeing  its  two  enormous  arches,  built  of  stone  and 
brick,  at  right  angles  to  each  other,  with,  apparently,  the  ruins  of  a 
tower  at  the  comer.  M.  Ujfalvy  gives  no  information  respecting  its 
origin ;  and  Dr.  Schuyler  says  that  he  could  get  none.  I  observe, 
however,  that  M.  Khanikoff,  writing  thirty  years  earlier,  after  speaking 
of  the  desirabilty  of  exploring  the  ruins  of  Afrasiab  Kaleh,  says,  "It 
would  be  not  less  curious  to  ascertain  if  there  exist  the  remains  of  a 
bridge  over  the  Zarafshan,  known  to  Arabian  geographers  under  the 
name  of  Kantarel  Samarkand,  and  of  which  they  speak  as  a  marvel." 
Here,  then,  seems  to  be  the  answer  to  M.  Khanikoff;  and  if  this  can 
be  substantiated,  this  bridge  will  probably  prove  the  oldest  building 
near  Samarkand.  Wliat  may  be  brought  to  light  hereafter  under  the 
Afrasiab  ruins,  by  organized  search,  remains  to  be  seen.  Meanwhile 
archaeologists  will  be  thankful  that  von  Kaufmann  would  not  have  these 
and  similar  places  disturbed  until  he  could  secure  the  attendance,  as 
he  hoped  to  do,  of  competent  antiquarians  to  superintend  th^  work  of 
excavation. 


THE  ANCIENT  CAPITAL   OF  THE  TIMURIDS.     565 

his  name.*  Nothing  now  remains  of  the  observatory  ; 
and  the  hill  derives  its  present  name  from  the  small 
tomb  of  a  saint  placed  on  the  top,  Chupan-Ata  being 
the  patron,  of  shepherds,  as  well  as  pf  the  city  of 
Samarkand. 

It  was  from  this  direction,  as  I  have  said,  that  we 
approached  the  city  on  the  28th  September,  and  sighted, 
from  the  Tashkend  road,  the  enamelled  dome  of  Timur's 
tomb,  as  prominent  an  object  in  miniature  as  the  dome 
of  St.  Paul's  from  London  Bridge.  The  road  passed 
through  an  ancient  cemetery,  and  continued  past  the 
place  of  Bibi-Khanum,  and  the  bazaar,  to  the  Rhigi- 
stan,  or  market-place,  bounded  on  three  sides  by 
the  medresses  Ulug-Beg,  Shir-Dar,  and  Tillah-Kari. 
Instead  of  following  this  road,  however,  our  driver 
turned  to  the  right  on  passing  inside  the  wall,  and 
drove  down  an  avenue,  planted  by  the  Russians,  on 
the  eastern  side  of  the  citadel,  and  so  brought  us  to 
the  grove  of  trees,  where  is-  situated  the  palace  of  the 
Governor.  General  Ivanoff,  as  I  have  intimated,  was 
at  Tashkend,   but  the  soldiers  in  charge  of  his  house 

•  He  caused  instruments  to  be  ^constructed  of,  a  better  pattern  and 
greater  dimensions  than  any  that  had  hitherto  been  used  for  making 
astronomical  observations.  Among  these  was  a  stupendous  quadrant, 
the  radius  of  which  is  said  to  have  been  as  high  as  the  dome  of  Santa 
Sophia  at  Constantinople ;  but  this  is  supposed  to  be  an  exaggerated 
description,  or  to  have  been  only  a  gnomon.  In  the  course  of  some 
investigations  undertaken  by  Ulug-Beg,  he  found  that  certain  stars  in 
Ptolemy* s  catalogue,  reduced  to  his  own  epoch,  did  not  accord  with 
the  observations  made  at  Samarkand,  and  he  therefore  undertook  the 
laborious  task  of  making  a  new  set  of  astronomical  tables,  and  of  re- 
observing  the  whole  of  the  catalogue.  Hence  the  origin  and  cause  of 
*'  Ulug-Beg' s  Tables.'*  They  are  divided  into  four  parts,  referring  to 
respective  treatises  on  the  epochs  and  eras,  on  the  knowledge  of  time, 
on  the  course  of  the  planets,  and  on  the  positions  of  the  hxed  stars. 
The  tables  are  reckoned  by  far  the  best  of  any  of  those  handed  down  to 
us  by  the  Muhammadans. — ^^^  Proceedings  of  the  Royal  Astronomical 
Society t  Vol.  xiii.

were  expecting  us;  and,  seeing  that  Samarkand  has  no 
hotel,  it  was  no  small  treat  to  find  ourselves  in  the 
best  quarters  in  the  town,  with  everything  clean  and 
comfortable,  including  the  luxury  of  a  bath.  The 
palace  is  an  oblong,  lofty. building  on  one  floor,  with 
a  massive  porch  midway  on  the  longer  side.  The 
interior  is  divided  lengthwise  into  two  suites  of  rooms, 
the  front  door  opening  into  a  spacious  hall.  To  the 
right  of  this  is  the  dining-room,  and  to  the  left  sitting 
and  sleeping  rooms,  whilst  the  other  half  of  the  house 
is  taken  up  with  offices  and  bed-room  at  either  end, 
and  ball-room  and  drawing-rooms  in  the  centre.  The 
Russian  Government  provides  houses  of  this  descrip- 
tion for  governors  of  provinces,  and  furnishes  them, 
so  that  I  w^s  fairly  familiar  with  the  interior  arrange- 
ments of  the  house  ;  but  this  palace  at  Samarkand  was 
surrounded  by  finer  gardens,  and  had  a  more  imposing 
approach  than  any  other  similar  residence  I  remem- 
bered to  have  seen.  General  Korolkofif,  who  was 
temporarily  acting  as  Governor,  was  not  living  in  the 
palace,  but,  though  early,  we  went  to  him  at  once,  and 
found  in  him  one  of  the  most  polished  and  intellectual  of 
Russian  officers  it  has  been  my  good  fortune  to  meet. 
Botany  is  one  of  his  studies,  and  apart  from  the  intro- 
duction of  Generals  Abramoff  and  Ivanoff,  I  had  another 
to  him  from  M.  Regel,  the  director  of  the  Botanical 
Gardens  at  Petersburg.  The  General  spoke  French, 
and  was  able  to  give  me  a  good  deal  of  information,  so 
that  our  time  spent  indoors  was  both  pleasant  and 
instructive. 

We  were  impatient  to  see  the  **  lions  "  of  the  town, 
and  made  our  way  first  to  the  Gur-Emir,  a  small  but 
lofty  mausoleum  surmounted  by  a  melon-shaped  dome, 
the  top  being  perhaps  from  200  to  250  feet  high.      On 


THE  ANCIENT  CAPITAL   OF  THE  TIMURIDS.     5.67 

the  sides  of  the  building  rose  two  minarets,  one  being 
already  in  ruins,  and  the  other  not  safe  enough  to 
ascend.  Near  at  hand  is  a  tall  arch,  also  much 
dilapidated.  That  which  imparts  to  the  building  its 
striking  appearance  on  the  exterior  is  the  colour  of  its 
enamelled  bricks,  built  in  mosaic,  and  made  to  repre- 
sent round  the  cornice  enormous  Arabic  letters,  that 
could  be  read,  I  should  think,  more  than  a  mile  off. 

The  building  is  approached  under  a  mosaic  portal 
across  a  paved  court  planted  with  a  score  of  karagach, 
apricot,  plum,  and  white  mulberry  trees.  Formerly 
the  court  was  enclosed  within  a  wall,  and  Vambery  so 
found  it,  but  now  the  gateways  alone  remain.  The 
front  of  the  building,  as  the  law  directs,  is  towards 
the  south,  but  the  entrance  is  on  the  west,  and  over 
the  gateway  we  entered  is  written  in  white  letters  en 
blue  ground,  "  This  is  the  work  of  poor  Abdullah,  son 
of  Mahmoud  of  Ispahan."  We  mount  five  stone 
steps,  and  at  the  distance  of  six  paces  another  step, 
and  then  arrive  at  the  first  wooden  door  leading  to  a 
vestibule,  the  door  being  modern  and  plain  without, 
but  carved  inside.  The  next  door  is  of  ancient 
carving,  inlaid  with  ivory,  and  over  it  is  a  low,  square, 
wooden  window  of  open  work  ;  above  this  is  a  second 
window  of  alabaster,  and  yet  higher  a  third,  also  of 
alabaster,  the  latter  two  with  oval  pediments.  On  the 
right  is  a  door  admitting  to  a  long  chamber,  where  are 
buried  some  of  the  female  members  of  Timur's  family, 
and  similarly  on  the  left  is  a  door  opening  into  a  low, 
arched  chamber,  surmounted  by  four  cupolas,  wherein, 
according  to  Fedchenko,  are  the  tombs  of  Timur's  son 
Mirza-Shah-Rokh  and  his  family.  Still  further  to  the 
left,  in  a  wing  of  the  principal  building,  is  an  entrance, 
M.    Ujfalvy   says,   of   unknown    purpose,    leading   to 


z^A  MUSSJAX  CE2niLAL  ASIA. 

the  tombs.  Probably  it  is  that  referred  to  by 
Fedchenko  in  the  cnpt,  in  the  wall  of  which,  he  says, 
••  there  was  once  a  door  through  which  the  dead  were 
brought  in,  but  it  is  now  built  up  with  bricks.  At  one 
time  there  were  four  entrances  into  this  building,  signi- 
fying that  people  flocked  from  the  four  quarters  of  the 
world  to  the  tomb  of  the  great  Emir." 

On  entering  the  principal  doorway  we  found  our- 
seh'es  in  an  octagonal  chamber,  ten  paces  in  diameter, 
wainscoted  to  a  height  of  nearly  five  feet  with  yashma^ 
or  jasper,  as  I  was  told,  and  as  is  commonly  said,  but 
which  Dr.  Schuyler  asserts  to  be  "  hexagonal  plates 
of  finely-carved  transparent  gjpsum."  I  brought  away 
a  piece  found  among  the  cUbris  outside,  and  on  show- 
ing it  at  the  Museum  of  Natural  History*  in  South 
Kensington,  it  has  been  pronounced  to  be  white, 
translucent,  and  massive  carbonate  of  lime.  Above 
this  are  three  rows  of  niches  carved  in  sandstone,  a 
foot  and  a  half  high,  then  inscriptions,  formerly  blue, 
18  inches  in  height,  also  in  niches  ;  and  above  all  this 
a  continuance  of  niches,  beautifully  carved,  and 
crowned  by  a  fine  arch.  The  colour  of  the  whole  is 
greyish  white,  and  looks  somewhat  ding^'  and  old. 
In  the  eastern  wall,  facing  Mecca,  is  an  arched  recess 
called  the  Mihrab,  wherein  rest  the  remains  of 
Said-Mir-Omar,  son  of  one  of  Timur's  preceptors. 
Opposite  the  doorway  by  which  we  entered  stood  a 
pillar  perhaps  four  feet  high,  surmounted  by  a  dome, 
under  which  was  formerly  kept  burning,  says  Ujfalvy, 
'*  the  lamp  of  perpetual  fire."*     1  cannot  answer  for

lamp  said  to  have  been  burning  since  the  7th  centur)',  in  honour  of  two 
Christians  who  then  saved  the  Jews.

the  perpetuity  of  the  fire  at  Samarkand,  but  I  found 
there  a  dirty  three-lipped  lamp  of  unusual  form,  left 
probably  by  a  pilgrim,  and  the  like  to  which  I  was 
told  I  could  get  in  the  bazaar  ;  whereupon  I  begged 
the  mullah  in  charge  to  let  me  have  that,  and  I  gave 
him  money  to  purchase  another  in  its  place,  I  was 
glad  to  have  secured  this  lamp  from  ^o  interesting  a 
spot,  and  the  more  so  because  in  my  subsequent 
wanderings  I  did  not  meet  with  another  of  precisely 
the  same  form.  The  pillar  is  said  to  indicate,  I 
believe,  where  the  head  lies,  and  near  it  is  erected  a 
rough  pole,  from  which  hangs,  as  usual  over  a  Muham- 
madan  hero,  a  banner  and  horse-tail. 

On  the  floor  of  the  mausoleum,  surrounded  by  an 
open-worked  railing  of  carved  alabaster,  are  seven 
tombstones.  Near  the  pillar  I  have  mentioned  is  the 
highest  but  least  elegant  tomb,  that  of  Mir-Said- Barak, 
or  Mir-Kulan-Said-Baraka,  Timur's  preceptor  and 
friend.  In  a  line  with  this  is  Tamerlane's  own  tombstone, 
and  near  it  that  of  his  grandson,  Ulug-Beg,  who,  accord- 
ing to  the  inscription,  died  in  1449.  The  other  stones 
cover  the  graves  of  Timur's  descendants  or  friends. 

The  one  stone  really  remarkable,  said  indeed  to 
be  unique,  is  that  over  the  tomb  of  Tamerlane.  It 
occupies  the  exact  centre  of  the  mosque.  The  other 
tombs  are  of  white  marble,  but  his  is  greenish  black, 
6  feet  long,  17  inches  wide,  and  14  inches  thick,  and 
of  a  single  block  of  nephrite  or  jade,  the  largest  mono- 
lith of  that  material  known.  The  surface  is  covered 
with  tracery,  and  around  the  edge  is  a  complicated 
inscription  in  antique  letters,  giving,  says  Dr.  Schuyler, 
**  Timur's  name  and  titles,  together  with  those  of  his 
ancestors,  and  the  date  of  his  death,  1405."*

The  floor  of  the  mausoleum  near  the  tombs  is  covered 
with  hexagonal  stones  of  what  is  said  to  be  jasper,  but 
more  probably  is  of  the  same  stone  as  the  wainscoting. 
A  spiral  flight  of  steps  of  wide  span  and  of  gfrey 
burnt  brick  leads  into  the  crypt,  where  are  the  g^raves, 
and  over  them  slabs  of  white  limestone,  seven  of 
them  being  arranged  exactly  under  their  respective 
representatives  above.  These,  too,  are  nearly  covered 
with  quotations,  it  is  said,  from  the  Koran. 

The  Gur-Emir  was  built  by  Timur  over  the  remains 
of  his  preceptor  Said  in  764  (1386),  some  time  before 
his  own  death.  Timur  died  in  Otrar,  within  400  miles 
of  Samarkand,  but  his  body,  according  to  his  own 
directions,  was  laid  by  the  side  of  that  of  his  pre- 
ceptor.* The  famous  monolith  was  brought  to 
Samarkand,  Khanikofi"  says,  quoting  Muhammad 
Fassikh,  in  141 5.  Some  say  that  it  was  the  present 
of  a  Mongol  princess.  Devotees  and  pilgrims  used  to 
flock  with  great  reverence  to  Timur's  grave,  but  the 
place  seems  to  have  fallen  into  neglect  until  the  coming 
of  the  Russians.! 

to  its  fabulous  journey  to  Nadir  Shah,  who,  having  heard  of  its  wonders 
as  a  bezoar,  ordered  it  to  be  brought  to  Meshed.  Dr.  Schuyler  refers  to 
one  of  the  lower  comers  as  broken  off,  and  M.  Ujfah-y  mentions  an  act 
of  vandalism  by  a  Russian  geologist,  who  stole  into  the  place  at  night, 
and  cut  out  a  piece  for  the  purpose,  as  he  said,  of  making  scientific 
analysis,  but  which  he  was  compelled  to  restore  to  its  place  as  well  as  it 
could  be  done  with  plaster,  thanks  to  the  outcries  of  General  Abramoff. 

♦  Schiltberger  tells  a  story  of  his  stay  at  Samarkand,  that  "  after 
Tamerlin  was  buried,  the  priests  that  belong  to  the  temple  heard  him 
howl  every  nighi  during  a  whole  year.  His  friends  gave  large  alms, 
that  he  should  cease  his  bowlings.  But  this  was  of  no  use.  They  asked 
advice  of  their  priests,  and  went  to  his  son  and  begged  that  he  would 
set  free  the  prisoners  taken  by  his  father  in  other  countries,  and 
especially  those  that  were  in  Samarkand,  who  were  all  craftsmen  he 
had  brought  to  his  capital,  where  they  had  to  work.  He  let  them  go, 
and  as  soon  as  they  were  free,  Tamerlin  did  not  howl  any  more." 

t  When  Khanikoff  was  there  in  184 1,  he  says  that  to  get  into  the  crj-pt  it 


THE  ANCIENT  CAPITAL   OF  THE  TIMURIDS.     571 

About  a  hundred  paces  from  the  Gur-Emir  there  is 
a  small  building  called  Ak-Serai,  where,  tradition  says, 
some  of  Timur's  wives  are  buried.  The  place  is  now 
in  ruins,  and  serves  as  a  stable,  but  in  Vambery's  time 
there  was  hanging  aloft  on  the  side  of  the  dome  a 
skein,  said  to  contain  hair  from  the  beard  of  the 
Prophet,  which  was  supposed  to  have  protected  the 
dome  from  further  decay.  I  saw  nothing  of  the 
Prophet's  beard,  though  I  may  mention  that  the  dome 
of  the  Gur-Emir  was  cracked  from  the  effects  of  a 
recent  earthquake,  and  at  the  time  of  my  visit  was 
undergoing  repairs.  This  gave  me  an  opportunity 
to  get  specimens  of  the  enamelled  bricks,  for  which 
purpose  I  mounted  the  scaffolding,  accompanied  by  a 
number  of  boys,  who  readily  searched  among  the 
debris  for  suitable  pieces,  and  one  of  them  brought 
several  in  his  lap  to  the  palace. 

The  object  in  Samarkand  next  in  interest  to  Timur*s 
tomb  is,  beyond  question,  the  mosque  of  Shah-Zindeh, 
which  Lehmann,  Khanikoff,  and  Vambery  call  Tamer- 
lane's Summer  Palace.  Fedchenko,  however,  is  not  of 
this  opinion,  and  until  proof  to  the  contrary  is  forth- 
coming, I  venture  to  agree  with  him  ;  for  the  building 
does  not  consist  of  habitable  chambers,  like  any  palace 
I  saw  in  the  East,  but  rather  of  places  set  apart  for 
religious  purposes. 

was  necessary  to  crawl  on  hands  and  knees.  At  the  date  of  Vambery's 
visit  in  1863,  there  were  at  the  head  of  the  graves  two  Rahle^  or  lecterns, 
for  supporting  sacred  volumes,  where  the  mullahs  in  turn  read  the 
Koran  day  and  night.  There  was  a  lectern  also  in  the  crypt,  with  a 
Koran  upon  it  written  in  folio  by  Othman,  Muhammad's  secretary, 
and  the  third  Khalif,  a  relic  said  to  have  been  brought  by  Timur  from 
Broussa,  and  which  was  kept  secretly  in  Samarkand  lest  other  Muham- 
madan  countries  knowing  of  the  treasure  should  be  jealous.  There 
were  also  preserved  upon  it,  according  to  Kostenko,  some  stains  of  the 
Khalif  s  blood,  who  was  slain  whilst  sitting  on  the  copy  of  the  sacred 
volume. 


572  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

The  legend  related  by  the  mullahs  concerning  the 
building  of  the  place  is  that  a  thousand  years  ago  there 
lived  a  saint,  whose  name  was  Hazret-i-Shah-Zindeh, 
who  one  day  dug  a  pit  and  disappeared  in  it,  saying 
that  he  would  live  there  for  ever.  Time  ran  on,  but 
there  were  unmistakable  signs  of  the  continued  exist- 
ence of  the  saint.  Timur,  wishing  to  be  convinced  of 
the  miraculous  preservation  of  the  holy  man,  caused 
several  persons  to  be  let  down  into  the  pit.  But  none 
of  them  came  again  to  the  top,  whereupon  one  man 
volunteered  to  descend,  directing,  however,  that  he 
should  be  lowered  head  foremost,  because  he  said  it 
was  not  respectful  to  go  down  feet  foremost  to  the 
saint.  When  this  man  reached  the  bottom  of  the  pit 
he  found  the  saint  in  prayer,  and  was  so  struck  by  his 
appearance  that  he  fainted,  remaining  senseless  for 
three  days.  When  he  recovered,  the  saint  told  him 
all  was  well,  because  he  was  evidently  a  God-fearing 
man,  but  that  if  he  uttered  a  word  of  what  he  *had  seen 
he  and  his  children  to  the  eighth  generation  should  be 
dumb.  On  regaining  the  earth's  surface,  the  man, 
threatened  by  Timur  with  death,  told  everything,  and 
it  came  to  pass  that  he  was  struck  dumb.  Whereupon 
Timur,  in  the  interest  of  the  poor  man,  for  whose  sin 

he  was  himself  answerable,  prayed  to  the  saint,  and,  to 
propitiate  him,  erected  in  his  honour  the  splendid  edifice 
called  the  Shah-Zindeh  (or  living  king).  Nevertheless, 
says  the  legend,  that  man  and  his  children  to  the 
eighth  generation  were  all  dumb.* 

The    mosque   of  Shah-Zindeh,    or   more   properly 

•  Dr.  Schuyler,  and  in  part  Professor  Vambery,  gives  a  similar 
story  of  a  Kasim  Ibn  Abbas,  who  came  to  Samarkand  in  early  Moslem 
times,  and  preached  the  Koran  with  great  success,  till  on  this  very 
spot  he  was  overcome  by  the  infidels  and  beheaded.  Whereupon, 
adroitly  seizing  his  head,  Kasim  leaped  into  a  well  hard  by,  where  he 


TilE  ANCIENT  CAPITAL   OF  THE  TIMURIDS.     573 

Kasim-bin-Abbas,  is  situated  about  a  mile  beyond  the 
city  gates,  built,  as  it  were,  in  stages  on  the  side  of  a 
hill^  on  which  is  an  immense  cemetery,  still  used,  and 
from  whence  are  visible  the  seven  domes  of  the  mosque. 
The  gateway  opens  upon  the  road,  and  is  approached 
by  several  steps.  On  the  right  at  entering  is  a  small 
court,  with  chambers  for  the  mullahs,  and  a  well  of 
excellent  water,  whilst  on  the  left  is  a  hall  or  mosque, 
where  Muhammadan  service  is  held.  When  we 
entered,  worship  was  being  conducted  by  a  Muham- 
madan sect  called  Nadamat,  closely  resembling  the 
service  I  had  seen  at  Constantinople  of  the  ** howling" 
dervishes,  and  which  I  shall  describe  later  on.  Mount- 
ing a  flight  of  37  high  and  broad  steps,  which  were 
once  covered  with  marble,  we  came  to  a  long  un- 
covered gallery,  flanked  by  two  lofty  chambers,  open 
at  the  side  and  capped  with  cupolas. 

Along  this  gallery  were  pointed  out  to  us  several 
tombs,  and  among  them  those  of  a  sister  and  an  uncle 
of  Tamerlane,  the  enamel  work  on  all  of  them  being 
more  beautiful  than  any  I  saw  elsewhere  in  Central 
Asia,  unless,  perhaps,  at  Kunia  Urgenj.*  In  Dr. 
Schuyler's  time  he  says  that  there  were  quantities  of 
fragments  to  be  picked  up,  but  the  Russians  have 
since  done  much  to  restore  the  building  and  remove 

still  remains,  ready  to  come  forth  at  some  future  day  as  the  defender  of 
Islam. 

*  The  ornamentation,  moreover,  was  of  several  kinds.  Here  were 
mosaics  built  of  uni-coloured  bricks.  In  other  parts  were  bricks,  each 
with  various  shades  of  colour,  whilst  there  were  in  several  parts  small 
pieces  of  brick  faced  with  colour,  and  fitting  into  one  another  in  mosaic, 
and  a  fourth  kind  of  enamelling  on  an  embossed  surface  of  squares, 
circles,  and  stars.  One  of  the  mosques  had  a  melon-shaped  dome, 
with  the  tiles  nearly  all  fallen  off.  The  interior  walls  of  the  buildings 
are  covered  with  mosaic,  and  the  domes,  supported  by  slender,  carved, 
wooden  columns,  are  fiill  of  bold,  yet  elegant,  pendent  work  in  alabaster. 
The  walls  along  the  staircase  were  formerly  covered  with  tiling. 


574  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

the  cUbris,  as  at  Tamerlane's  tomb.  I  found  the 
mullahs  abundantly  willing  to  get  me  some  specimens, 
and,  though  making  heavy  baggage,  I  was  thankful  to 
secure  some  of  each  kind. 

At  the  end  of  the  gallery  we  came  to  the  ancient 
mosque  with  its  courts,  chambers,  and  crypt.  In  one 
of  the  rooms  was  a  door  of  iron  grating,  secured  by  a 
fish-shaped  lock,  having  behind  it,  dimly  distinguish- 
able, a  monument,  or  object  covered  with  cloths.  In 
an  adjoining  room  was  an  immense  Koran,  6  feet  by  4 
when  open,  and  we  were  shown  an  underground  cell, 
where  devotees  might  shut  themselves  up  for  40  days* 
fasting  and  praying  to  the  saint.  In  reply  to  my 
inquiry  how  much  those  fasting  ate,  I  was  informed 
that  of  the  10  or  15  who  come  there  annually,  some 
eat  on  the  evening  of  each  day,  some  only  once  in 
three  days,  and  all  as  little  as  possible.  In  former 
times  the  rulers  of  Samarkand  paid  their  reverence  at 
Shah-Zindeh  before  entering  the  city  in  triumph,  and 
the  mosque  became  a  famous  place  of  pilgrimage.  In 
Vambery's  day  there  were  offered  for  the  faithful  to 
kiss,  three  flags,  an  old  sword,  and  a  breastplate,  as 
relics  of  Timur,  and  also  there  were  said  to  exist 
certain  relics  of  the  saint ;  but  I  saw  nothing  of  these, 
and  when  I  wished  to  look  down  the  well  of  Shah 
Zindeh,  I  was  asked  not  to  do  so,  the  mullahs  saying 
that  even  von  Kaufmann,  the  Governor-General,  had 
respected  the  holy  place,  and  did  not  enter  there. 
These  things  naturally  reminded  me  of  the  so-called 
holy  places  on  the  European  Continent,  but  the  votive 
offerings  left  at  the  holy  places  of  Islam  are  fewer  and 
much  poorer  than  the  offerings  at  the  shrines  of  Roman 
or  Russian  saints.  Here  they  consisted  merely  of 
prayer-cloths,   on  which  Moslems  have  knelt,  and  of 


THE  ANCIENT  CAPITAL   OF  THE  TIMURIDS,     575 

pictures  brought  by  pilgrims  from  Mecca.  I  found 
the  mullahs  by  no  means  fanatical,  for  they  thankfully 
accepted  a  Persian  Bible,  and  appeared  delighted  to 
get  it. 

Returning  down  the  Shah-Zindeh  avenue,  between 
rows  of  gypsies  who  sit  like  Bar  Timaeu»  **  by  the 
way-side  begging,"  the  traveller  regains  the  Tashkend 
road  and  comes  to  the  Place  of  Bibi-Khanum,  or  Queen 
Bibi  {JiJian  and  k/ianum  meaning  king  and  queen,  lord 
and  lady),  where  are  ruins  of  other  two  buildings  that 
date  from  the  time  of  Timur.  The  Bibi  is  spoken  of 
as  his  favourite  wife,  and  the  daughter  of  a  Chinese 
emperor,  who,  from  her  private  purse,  built  the 
medresse  that  bears  her  nariie,  according  to  Muham- 
mad Fassikhi,  in  the  year  1404.* 

There  remain  several  indications  showing  that  the 
Bibi-Khanum  medresse  must  have  been  one  of  if  not 
the  finest  in  Central  Asia.  Its  chief  mosque  is  said 
by  Khanikoff  to  have  been  built  by  the  side  of  the 
medresse  in  1398,  by  Timur.  It  is  crowned  with 
what  is  for  Turkistan  a  gigantic  double  dome ;  but 
what  struck  me  most  was  the  lofty  graceful  arch  of  the 
Pishtak,  or  front  entrance.  Its  proportions  seemed  to 
me  perfect ;  and  whether  it  was  the  contrast   to  the 

*  Schuyler  saiys  1.^85,  and  Ujfalvy  1388.  Khanikoff  records  that  the 
princess  brought  from  her  native  country  artists,  who  ornamented  the 
edifice,  though  I  confess  I  saw  no  traces  of  Chinese  work  about  the 
place,  nor  have  I  read  of  any.  Khanikoff  speaks  of  *'  three  mosques 
with  high  domes,  united  by  a  four-cornered  building,  on  the  east  of 
which  were  once  brass  gates  with  inscriptions  and  carvings.  The 
building  must  have  occupied  a  vast  space,  and  is  said  to  have  accom- 
modated in  its  three  wings  a  thousand  students.  The  gates  were 
long  since  melted  into  money  by  the  impoverished  Amir  Haidar,  and 
the  walls  of  the  building  became  so  cracked  and  crumbled  that,  about 
t86o,  the  medresse  ceased  to  be  used  for  its  original  purpose.  At  the 
time  of  Vamber}'*s  visit  the  building  was  a  standing- place  for  native 
carts,  and  the  Russians  at  their  coming  found  the  medresse  a  ruin. 


576  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

surrounding  ruins,  and  crumbling  minarets,  or  what,  I 
know  not,  but  as  I  gazed  I  began  to  think  the  arch  one 
of  the  loftiest  I  had  ever  seen.  I  tried  to  compare 
with  it,  by  the  eye  of  memory,  the  east  window  of 
York  Minster,  and  it  was  not  till  I  measured  the 
breadth  of  the  Bibi-Khanum  arch,  which  I  found  to 
be  50  feet,  that  I  could  bring  myself  to  realize  that  its 
height  could  not  exceed  from  100  to  150  feet.  Still, 
I  am  quite  disposed  to  agree  with  M.  Ujfalvy,  that  the 
contour  and  lines  of  this  ruin  show  it  to  have  been  the 
finest  of  the  buildings  in  Samarkand.  The  depth  of 
the  portal  was  30  feet,  and  the  walls  of  this  and  other 
parts  of  the  building  were  once  covered  with  polished 
mosaic,  striking  for  its  medley  of  colours.  The  design 
has  been  skilfully  executed,  and  bears  marks  of  culti- 
vated taste.  The  colouring  and  gold  in  many  places 
still  look  fresh,  but  none  of  the  porcelain  is  of  open 
work  like  that  of  the  Shah-Zindeh. 

On  either  side  of  the  principal  entrance  is  a  slender 
hexagonal  tower  measuring  54  feet  round,  from  which 
the  mosaic  is  peeling  fast.  Not  far  distant  is  a  large 
square  stone  slab,  sloping  towards  the  centre,  for 
Mussulman  ablutions,  and  in  the  middle  of  the  build- 
ing is  an  immense  Rahle,  or  lectern,  of  white  marble, 
7  feet  long  by  6  wide,  having  the  appearance  of  two 
sloping  desks  joined  at  the  lower  sides  and  supported 
on  nine  low  pillars.  On  this  formerly  used  to  lie  a 
huge  copy  of  the  Koran,  seen  by  the  Russian  Ephremof, 
who  visited  Samarkand  in  1770.  The  lectern,  with 
its  parchment  book  and  large  characters,  was  placed 
within  sight  of  a  high  window  at  which  tradition  says 
Bibi-Khanum  used  to  sit  and  read.  The  chief  merit 
of  the  lectern  now  consists  in  its  miracle-working 
power  of  curing  for  life  pains  in  the  back-bones,  pro-

vided  the  sufferer  manages  to  crawl  beneath,  which  the 
faithful  do  in  all  directions. 

Bibi-Khanum  lies  buried  in  an  adjoining  octagonal 
building,  called  Bibi-Khanum-Gur-Khana,  which  at 
the  visit  of  Khanikoff  was  much  defaced.  When  the 
Russian  authorities  were  clearing  the  courts  of  the 
medresses  of  rubbish,  they  found  this  small  mosque, 
which  had  been  concealed  by  the  surrounding  build- 
ings and  almost  forgotten,  but  wherein  they  were  told 
was  the  tomb  of  Bibi-Khanum.  A  short  time  after, 
the  roof,  falling  in,  broke  through  the  floor,  and 
exposed  a  large  vault  containing  grave-stones,  with 
inscriptions  of  prayers  in  ancient*  characters,  but 
without  names  or  dates.  I  entered  the  vault,  and 
saw  there  five  tombstones,  all  lying  east  and  west, 
and  said  to  be  those  of  Bibi  and  four  children. 
The  mosque  and  medresse  of  Bibi-Khanum  are  too 
much  dilapidated  to  be  repaired  or  restored,  but  the 
Russians  have  cleared  away  the  cUbriSy  and  sur- 
rounded them  with  palings  to  keep  them  from  further 
injury. 

From  these  buildings  we  went  to  the  citadel  to  see 
another  curiosity — said  to  date  from  Timur's  days — 
namely,  a  coronation  stone,  called  the  Kok-tash.  In 
this  citadel  was  a  palace  built  for  the  Emir  Nasr-UUah, 
and  in  the  palace  a  court  that  was  used  for  state 
occasions,  which  Vambery  calls  **  Talari  Timur,'*  or 
**the  reception-hall  of  Timur."  The  court  is  oblong, 
and  on  the  sides  dther  than  that  where  we  entered, 
there  runs  round  the  building  a  raised  covered 
veranda,  or  cloister,  supported  by  wooden  columns, 
whilst  at  the  end  opposite  the  entrance  is  placed  the 
famous  stone  called  Kok-tash.* 

♦  This  word  is  interpreted  by  various  writers  to  mean  green,  blue, 
VOL.  T.  37 


578  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

The  Kok-tash  is  an  oblong  block  ot  greyish  marble, 
with  dark  streaks,  polished  on  the  top,  carved  in  ara- 
besques on  the  sides,  and  with  small  pilasters  at  the 
corners.*  There  is  a  railing  put  round  the  stone  now 
to  keep  it  from  injury,  and  behind  it,  on  the  wall,  is 
affixed  an  object  alluded  to  by  both  Vambery  and 
Schuyler,  though  I  have  no  recollection  of  seeing  it 
— namely,  an  oval  piece  of  metal  like  half  a  cocoa-nut, 
bearing  an  Arabic  inscription  engraved  in  Cufic 
letters,  t 

and  grey,  which  Schuyler  varies  by  whitish-grey ;  the  fact  being,  ac- 
cording to  Fedchenko,  that  though  Kok  does  mean  green  (as  also 
grey  in  Kok-biira  or  grey  wolf),  yet  Kdk-tash  means  simply  "  marble." 
Dr.  Schuyler,  however,  suggests  another  origin  of  the  meaning  of  the 
word  from  Baber,  who  speaks  of  the  palace  Timur  constructed  in  the 
citadel  of  Samarkand  as  being  four  stories  high,  and  famous  by  the 
name  of  Kok'Sarat^  yxst  as  his  palace  in  Kesh  was  called  Ak-sarai, 
or  white  palace.  The  Kok-sarai,  Baber  says,  was  remarkable  in  that 
every  prince  of  Timur' s  race,  who  mounted  his  throne,  did  so  there,  and 
it  was  there  also  that  usurpers  to  that  throne  were  put  to  death.  The 
Kok-tash  is  said  to  have  served  for  the  foundation  of  Timur* s  throne, 
and  so  perhaps  received  its  name  from  being  the  famous  stone  in  the 
Kok'Sarai. 

*  My  notes  record  its  rough  measurement  as  lo  x  5  x  3  feet, 
but  Dr.  Schuyler  doubtless  is  more  accurate,  who  gives  its  length 
10  feet  4  inches,  breadth  4  feet  9  inches,  and  height  2  feet  without 
the  brick  and  plaster  pedestal.  Vambery  gives  its  height  at  4^ 
feet,  and  says  that  when  it  was  to  be  mounted  by  the  sovereign, 
some  prisoner  of  illustrious  birth  was  always  forced  to  serve  as  a 
footstool.  When  the  Russians  took  the  city  there  was  a  decorated 
slab  of  hard  plaster,  forming  a  back  to  the  stone,  and  making  it  appear 
like  a  throne.  This,  however,  was  thought  to  be  of  recent  date,  and 
when  it  fell  off  it  was  not  replaced.  When  the  elevation  of  the  sove- 
reign on  the  Kok-tash  had  grown  into  a  custom,  a  legend  arose  that 
the  stone  had  fallen  from  heaven,  and  would  not  allow  a  false  Khan  to 
approach  it.  So  late  as  1722  complaint  was  made  that  Abul  Feiz 
Khan  had  never  gone  through  the  ceremony  of  sitting  on  the  Kok-tash, 
and  rebels  proclaimed  in  his  place  Regin  Khan,  who  was  consecrated 
in  the  usual  manner. 

f  It  is  a  pity  that  such  an  Oriental  scholar  as  Professor  Vambery 
does  not  give  the  translation,  and  thus  confirm  or  correct  that  of  Dr. 
Schuyler's  interpreter;   for,  if  the  version  of  this  latter  be  true,  this 


THE  ANCIENT  CAPITAL   OF  THE  TIMURIDS.     579 

When  we  walked  down  from  the  gallery  some  3  or  4 
feet,  into  the  central  space  below,  somewhat  resembling 
an  arena,  there  was  pointed  out  to  us  in  the  middle  a  large 
octagonal  stone  some  3  feet  high,  in  the  top  of  which  is 
a  cylindrical  hollow,  like  a  water  basin,  but  which  served, 
we  were  told,  for  the  execution  of  offenders.* 

The  mention  of  one  more  ruin  will  complete  the 
list  of  those  immediately  connected  with  Timur..  I 
mean  the  Ishrat  Khanay  in  the  suburbs  of  the  town, 
whither,  according  to  tradition,  Timur  was  wont  to 
repair  for  recreation.  One  may  still  perceive  in  the 
ruin  small  apartments  in  addition  to  the  large  central 
hall  in  the  second  floor.  The  inhabitants  of  Samar- 
kand relate  that  Bibi-Khanum  built  this  for  her  tomb, 
but  that  Timur,  on  paying  a  visit  of  inspection  on 
the  completion  of  the  building,  was  so  delighted  that 
he  kissed  his  wife,  whereupon,  confused  and  pleased, 
Bibi-Khanum  said,  *'  Let  this  be  Ishrat-Khan  s  house 
of  gaiety  and  pleasure ;  a  repository  for  my  remains 
shall  be  built  elsewhere." 

I  shall  now  proceed  to  mention  some  of  the  later 
Muhammadan  antiquities,  and  also  such  information  as 
I  was  able  to  gather  respecting  the  Jews  in  Samarkand. 

must  be  the  oldest  kno^ns  relic  in  Samarkand.  It  is  said  to  have  been 
brought  from  the  treasury  of  the  Sultan  Bayazid  Yildirin,  and  to  have 
served  one  of  the  Khalifs  as  an  amulet.  The  inscription  is  interpreted 
to  read,  '*  This  is  the  tomb  of  the  Sheikh  Imam,  the  Hermit  Khoja 
Akhmet  Kodoveri  Ishak  £1  Khivi.  May  heaven  forgive  him  and  his 
parents,  and  all  Mussulmans  who  have  died.  Dated  the  22nd  day  of 
the  month  Moharrem,  in  the  year  550  (1172)  of  the  Hejira  of 
Muhammad." 

*  I  know  not  if  this  be  true,  but  coupling  with  it  the  statement  of 
Baber  that  usurpers  were  put  to  death  at  the  Kok-sarai,  and  recalling 
the  fact  that  the  Emir  Nasr-Ullah,  even  on  his  death-bed,  caused  to  be 
brought  the  sister  of  one  of  his  adversaries,  to  be  slain  in  his  presence, 
the  position  of  this  stone,  as  an  alleged  place  of  execution,  seems  to 
illustrate  Luke  xix.  27,  "But  those,  mine  enemies,  which  would  not 
that  I  should  reign  over  them,  bring  hither  and  slay  them  before  me.*^

ON  reaching  a  foreign  city  for  the  first  time,  it  is  a 
favourite  endeavour  of  mine  to  mount  some 
lofty  pinnacle  from  whence  to  obtain  a  view  of  the 
whole.  I  lost  no  time  in  doing  this  at  Samarkand  ; 
for  having  arranged  our  effects  at  the  palace,  we  called 
after  breakfast  at  the  telegraph  office,  and  oii  General 
Korolkoff,  and  then  visited  the  Gur-Emir  before  lunch, 
after  which  we  proceeded,  under  the  guidance  of  a 
Russian  officer,  to  the  Rhigistan.  Here  we  ascended 
one  of  the  minarets  of  the  Ulug-Beg  Medresse,  said  to 
be  45  ghiaz,  or  1 50  feet,  high. 

We  gained  from  hence  a  capital  view  of  the  town. 
To  the  north,  five  miles  off,  lay  the  wooded  and  culti- 
vated country  on  the  banks  of  the  Zarafshan,  with  the 
Chupan-Ata  hills  on  the  north-east,  and  nearer  were 
the  Shah-Zindeh,  and  the  Bibi-Khanum  ruins,  as  well 
as  the  Tashkend  road,  and  the  avenue  by  which  we 


MUHAMMADAN  AND  JEWISH  SAMARKAND.    581 

had  arrived.  On  the  east  was  the  Kalendar-Kareh 
gate  and  the  roads  leading  to  Penjakend  and  Urgut. 
On  the  west  was  the  citadel  with  the  Emir's  palace, 
having  the  Koktash;  and  beyond  the  citadel,  radiating 
like  a  fan,  were  the  straight  and  regular  streets  of  the 
Russian  quarter,  with  its  public  garden,  Governor's 
palace,  and  shady  promenade  ;  whilst  on  the  south  rose 
the  graceful  dome  of  the  Gur-Emir,  and  beyond  it  the 
Khoja-Akhrar  gate.  The  wide  streets,  and  the  coloured 
roofs  of  the  Russian  houses,  presented  a  marked  con- 
trast to  the  low  mud  house-tops,  and  the  narrow, 
tortuous  lanes  of  the  native  city,  in  which,  however, 
the  direction  of  the  principal  thoroughfares  did  not 
appear  to  us  so  hopelessly  irregular  and  intricate  as 
at  Tashkend  and  Khokand.  Moreover,  the  city  is  seen 
to  be  large,  and  full  of  gardens,  and  these,  watered 
by  three  streams,  give  to  it  an  aspect  less  dismal  than 
most  of  the  towns  we  had  seen.  At  the  same  time,  it 
is  a  long  way  from  an  Englishman's  idea  of  what  the 
native  poets  have  called  it — **  a  terrestrial  paradise  "  ! 
This  euphuism  may  have  referred,  however,  to  ancient 
times,  when  the  cultivation  of  the  surrounding  country 
was  much  greater  than  it  now  is.  The  high  walls  with 
embrasures  now  measure  9  miles  round.*  The  citadel 
is  the  largest  in  Central  Asia,  and  is  girt  with  its  own 
battlemented  wall,  8  feet  high,  and  10  feet  thick  at  the 
base.     In  circumference  it  measures  a  mile  and  a  half. 


*  The  ground  the  city  covered  in  former  times  is  judged  to  have  been 
more  considerable,  since  the  ruins  of  an  old  wall  that  once  apparently 
surrounded  it  are  now  3  miles  distant  on  the  western  side ;  and  on  the 
north,  over  the  space  between  the  present  walls  and  the  Zarafshan,  the 
ground  is  strewn  with  the  ruins  called  Afrasiab.  This  extension  must 
have  been  before  the  time  of  Timur,  in  whose  day  Samarkand  was 
comprised  within  its  present  limits,  only  that  the  gardens,  judging  from 
present  traces  of  them,  extended  further.

Here  are  now  the  barracks,   Russian  church,  arsenal. 
Government  stores  and  stables. 

The  city  had  six  gates.  One  on  the  south,  called 
Khoja-Akhrar,  leads  to  a  medresse  of  that  name,  about 
four  miles  distant,  in  the  court  of  which  is  a  pool  of 
water  and  some  venerable  plane-trees.*  This  medresse 
is  interesting  also,  because  it  is  said  to  have  once 
possessed  the  Koran  of  Othman,  which  I  previously 
stated  to  have  been  lodged  in  the  Gur-Emir.f 

There  is  another  tradition  interesting  to  literary 
antiquarians  that  I  ought  perhaps  to  mention  here, 
respecting  the  collection  of  Greek,  Syrian,  Chaldean, 

♦  The  mosaic  tiling  here  is  still  in  good  preservation,  presenting 
some  of  the  most  beautiful  designs  to  be  seen  in  the  country,  and  con- 
cerning which  M.  Ujfalvy  observes  that  he  found  there  mosaics  of 
flowers ;  bright  blue,  orange,  and  green  hues  being  mingled  with  deli- 
cate pink  to  represent,  not  merely  arabesques,  but  the  petals  of  large 
flowers.  As  far  as  I  remember,  these  representations  were  usually 
conspicuous  by  their  absence ;  for  the  Sunnite  Muhammadans  are 
particularly  strict  in  portraying  nothing  that  has  life,  whether  animal 
or  vegetable.  Dr.  Schuyler  mentions,  however,  that  on  this  mosque,  as 
on  the  Shir-Dar,  are  represented  Persian  lions,  which  probably  indicates 
that  both  buildings  were  erected  by  Persian  architects,  who,  being 
Shiites,  are  not  in  this  respect  equally  strict. 

t  Dr.  Schuyler  gives  the  manuscript  a  somewhat  different  history. 
According  to  his  version  of  the  traditional  story,  Khoja-Akhrar  was  a  rich 
saint  who  lived  400  years  ago  in  Tashkend,  and  became  the  head  of  the 
religious  order  of  Nakshbendi.  One  of  the  younger  brethren  of  the 
community,  being  at  Constantinople  on  pilgrimage,  cured  the  Khalif  of 
disease  by  reading  a  benediction  Akhrar  had  given  him,  whereupon  the 
Khalif  bade  his  benefactor  ask  what  he  would.  The  pilgrim  chose  to 
have  the  Koran  of  Othman,  and  brought  it  to  Tashkend  to  his  master, 
who  subsequently  removed  to  Samarkand.  Here  it  was  placed  in  the 
Khoja-Akhrar  mosque,  and  so  remained  till  the  coming  of  the  Russians, 
when  it  was  sold  to  them  for  £12.  Dr.  Schuyler  adds  that  it  is  a 
beautiful  manuscript,  written  on  parchment,  in  Cufic  characters,  which 
not  one  of  the  learned  natives  could  read,  and  that  when  they  saw  the 
value  put  upon  it  by  the  Russians,  some  of  the  more  fanatical  thought 
to  remove  it  to  Bokhara.  This,  however,  was  forbidden  by  General 
Abramoff,  whereupon  the  Imams  said  that,  as  it  would  no  longer  bring 
them  in  money  from  pilgrims  who  came  and  paid  for  the  privilege  of 
kissing  and  touching  it,  they  might  as  well  dispose  of  it. 


MUHAMMADAN  AND  JEWISH  SAMARKAND,    583 

and  Armenian  manuscripts  said  to  have  been  brought 
to  Samarkand  by  Tamerlane.  The  Armenian  his- 
torian, Moses  Khorensky,  compiled  his  work  to  a 
large  extent  from  a  chronicle  he  states  to  have  been 
drawn  up  by  Marabas  Godin,  who  was  commissioned 
by  a  Persian  prince  to  collect  materials  from  Chal- 
dean and  Persian  sources,  for  a  history  of  the  Armenian 
nation.  This  chronicle,  it  would  appear,  is  now  lost, 
and  the  story  says  that  Tamerlane,  who  several 
times  ravaged  Armenia,  seized  all  her  manuscripts, 
including  that  of  Marabas,  and  carried  them  to  Samar- 
kand.* 

Accordingly,  since  Marabas  Godin's  chronicle  filled 
so  important  a  place  in  Armenian  literature,  the 
Armenians  living  in  Turkey  a  few  years  since  applied 
to  the  Russian  Ambassador  in  Constantinople,  General 
Ignatief,  asking  him  to  move  the  Ministry  of  Foreign 
Affairs  and  the  Governor-General  of  Turkistan  to 
cause  inquiry  to  be  made  for  the  precious  Armenian 
manuscript.     But  the  Russians,  on  occupying  Samar- 

♦  This  story,  it  is  true,  is  not  much  more  than  a  verbal  tradition. 
The  chronicler,  Thomas  Metsobetsi,  who  was  in  Armenia  at  the  time 
of  Tamerlane's  invasion,  which  he  describes  in  detail,  says  nothing 
of  the  collection  of  books  and  their  being  sent  to  Samarkand,  nor 
do  other  contemporary  Armenian  historians  and  chroniclers.  There  is 
an  allusion,  however,  thereto  by  Father  Michael  Tchamchiyan  of  the 
Venetian  Brotherhood  of  Mkhitarists,  a  historian  of  Armenia,  who 
added  to  his  history  of  Tamerlane  the  following : — **  It  is  written  in 
several  places  that  Lan-Tamer,  having  collected  all  the  Armenian  and 
Persian  books  that  he  could  find,  sent  them  to  Samarkand,  and  placed 
them  in  a  tower  there.  Under  the  severest  penalties  he  forbade  the 
books  being  taken  from  the  tower,  but  those  desirous  of  reading  them 
were  permitted  to  go  to  the  tower,  not  being  allowed  to  remain  there 
very  long,  however.**  Tchamchiyan,  who  usually  places  the  names  of 
his  authorities  in  the  margin,  placed  opposite  the  foregoing  **  Kisha- 
takaran**  (whatever  that  may  mean),  and  added,  immediately  after,  the 
quotation,  "  But  however  this  may  be,  no  one  can  say  whether  these 
books  exist  at  the  present  time." 


584  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

kand,  could  find  no  trace  of  the  library,  nor  could 
the  natives  throw  any  light  upon  the  matter.* 

As  far  as  I  could  judge,  opinions  differed  widely 
as  to  my  chance  of  finding  manuscripts  in  Central 
Asia,  but  some  thought  it  possible  that,  on  the  approach 
of  the  Russians,  the  books  in  Samarkand  might  have 
been  taken  to  Bokhara  to  the  palace  of  the  Emir. 
Accordingly,  one  of  the  few  things  I  asked  of  his 
Majesty,  during  my  audience  at  Shahr-i-sabz,  was  that 
I  might  be  allowed  to  see  his  library.  He  replied  in 
the  affirmative ;  but  when  I  reached  his  palace  at 
Bokhara  I  was  shown  nothing  of  the  kind,  nor  did 
the  officials  left  in  charge  seem  to  know  anything 
about  a  library  !  On  another  occasion,  in  reply  to  my 
question  as  to  the  whereabouts  of  the  Emir's  books, 
one  of  the  officials  told  me,  with  the  utmost  simplicity, 
that  when  the  Emir  went  away  for  the  summer,  he 
took  his  books  in  a  cart  with  him — the  man  meaning, 
I  fancy,  his  records  and  account  books.  My  small 
efforts,  therefore,  for  the  discovery  of  Tamerlane's 
library  were  fruitless,  and  nothing  that  I  saw  or  heard 
led  me  to  think  that  anything  of  the  kind  exists. 

But  I  have  been  descanting  upon  these  antiquities 

*  The  author  of  an  article  in  the  Turkistan  Anntial  for  1874,  pp. 
405-6,  to  which  I  am  indebted  for  information  on  this  subject,  points 
out  that,  since  the  natives  have  got  to  know  the  Russians  somewhat 
better,  and  to  be  more  confiding,  there  have  been  found  with 
certain  Mullahs  and  Imams  rare  manuscripts,  such  as  the  "  Tarikhi- 
Narshakhi,"  and  also  another  called  **Tavarikh-Mir-l3araki,"  in 
which,  among  other  things,  is  described  the  campaign  of  Batu  in 
Russia,  and  consequently  that  perhaps  on  some  fortunate  day  the 
Armenian  manuscript  may  come  to  light.  Professor  Vambery  could 
find  no  trace  of  the  library  at  Samarkand  in  1863,  and  pronounced  the 
tradition  a  fable,  originating,  he  says,  from  the  over-strained  patriotism 
of  an  Armenian  priest,  named  Hadjator,  who  insists  that  he  came  from 
Cabool  to  Samarkand  and  discovered  in  the  latter  city  large  folios, 
with  heavy  chains,  in  towers  into  which  no  Mussulman,  for  fear  of 
genii,  would  dare  to  venture. 


MUHAMMADAN  AND  JEWISH  SAMARKAND,   585 

from  the  summit  of  the  Ulug-Bek  minaret,  looking  in 
the  direction  of  the  medresse  of  Khoja-Akhrar,  whilst 
immediately  below  are  three  medresses,  the  fronts  of ' 
which  bound  as  many  sides  of  the  handsomest  Rhigi- 
stan,  or  public  place,  in  Central  Asia.  We  will  descend 
from  the  minaret  and  take  up  our  position  on  the  south 
side  of  the  square,  where  we  have  before  us  three  lofty 
buildings,  similar  in  character,  having  facades  covered 
with  enamelled  bricks  in  beautiful  designs,  and  which, 
though  falling  into  decay,  testify  to  a  certain  sort  of 
magnificence  in  the  past. 

That  on  the  left,  on  the  west  of  the  square,  is  the 
college  of  Ulug-Beg,  the  oldest  but  smallest  of  the 
three.  Its  two  minarets  are  made  to  lean  like  the  tower 
of  Pisa,  M.  Ujfalvy  writes  ;  but  though  I  ascended  one, 
as  I  have  just  observed,  I  did  not  notice  any  inclination; 
and  Dr.  Schuyler  says  that  it  is  an  optical  illusion,  one 
side  being  upright,  and  the  other  at  an  angle,  the  illu- 
sion being  increased,  perhaps,  by  the  sides  of  the  portal 
not  being  parallel.  The  college  was  built  by  Ulug- 
Bek  in  1 42 1,  according  to  Khoja  Kalfa.  This  monarch, 
during  his  father's  lifetime,  is  said  to  have  attracted 
to  Samarkand  the  most  celebrated  astronomers  from 
different  parts  of  the  world,  and  in  the  observatory 
and  college  to  have  had  more  than  a  hundred  persons 
constantly  occupied  in  scientific  pursuits.  But  the 
college,  though  once  the  home  of  mathematics  and 
learning,  is  now  in  a  ruinous  state.  It  is  only  one 
floor  high,  and  contains  24  rooms.  Its  endowment  is 
430  acres  of  land,  2  bazaars,  2 1 1  shops,  and  7 1  ware- 
houses, bringing  in  an  annual  income  of  ;^ioo. 

The  college  on  the  east  is  the  Shir-Dar,  which  has  in 
front  a  lofty  arched  portal,  with  two  stories  of  students' 
rooms.     The  sides  of  the  medresse  have  no  windows. 


586  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

At  the  corners  in  front  are  minarets,  and  at  the  other 
end  cupolas  surmounted  by  melon-shaped  domes.  In 
the  upper  corners  of  the  fa9ade  over  the  arch  are  rude 
representations  in  blue  and  yellow  tiles  of  the  lion  and 
the  sun,  the  Persian  arms,  whence  the  name  given  to 
the  medresse  of  Shir-Dar,  or  lion-bearing.  The  facade 
is  richly  decorated  with  mosaic  in  earthenware  tiles, 
green,  blue,  white,  and  red.  The  interior  arrangement 
in  Central  Asian  colleges  generally  consists  of  a  large 
quadrangular  court,  surrounded  by  a  range  of  buildings, 
with  chambers  for  teachers  and  pupils ;  the  mesjed, 
mosque,  or,  as  we  should  say,  chapel,  being  on  the 
side  towards  Mecca.  On  entering  the  Shir-Dar,  the 
three  blocks  of  buildings  are  seen  to  have  two 
tolerably  lofty  stories,  containing  64  chambers,  each 
for  two  students,  many  of  whom  go  away  in  summer  to 
work.  This  medresse  and  the  Tillah-Kari  are  said  to 
have  been  built  about  16 18  by  Yalang  Tash  Bahadur, 
an  Uzbeg,  and  vizier  of  Imam  Kuli  Khan,  from  the 
spoils  of  the  shrine  at  Imam  Riza  in  Meshed  ;  and 
an  inscription  on  the  walls  of  the  Shir-Dar,  in  verse, 
in  honour  of  the  builder,  affirms  that  the  Moon,  on 
beholding  these  splendid  edifices,  placed  the  finger  of 
astonishment  on  her  lips.  The  endowment  of  the 
Shir-Dar  and  Tillah-Kari  consists  of  25  lots  of  land, 
containing  12,500  acres,  with  8  shops,  yielding  an 
annual  income  of  ;^  1,000,*  for  the  support  of  teachers 
and  students. 

The  college  on  the  north  side  of  the  Rhigistan  is 
called  Tillah'Kariy  that  is,  covered  with  tillahs,  or 
gold  coins.     The  exterior  is  a  good  deal  crumbled  ; 

*  The  mosques  and  medresses  of  Samarkand  number  58,  and  their 
property  consists  of  land,  shops,  sarais  or  warehouses,  a  bazaar,  mills, 
etc.,  producing  an  annual  income  of  £2,000.

it  has  minarets,  and  two  stories  of  windows  in  front, 
whilst  the  interior  is  in  a  better  state  of  preservation 
than  either  of  the  two  just  described.  Here  we  were 
taken  to  the  mosque  on  the  left-hand  side  of  the  court, 
and  our  attention  was  drawn  to  the  carved  woodwork 
steps  of  the  gilded  marble  pulpit,  on  which  the 
moulding  approached  very  nearly  to  the  dog-tooth 
carving  of  the  Gothic  style.  Greater  pains  and  art 
seem  to  have  been  bestowed  on  this  medresse  than 
on  the  others,  and  more  gold  is  seen  in  the  ornamenta- 
tion. The  wall  of  the  kibUh^  or  niche,  where  is  supposed 
tobethelmaum  (or  image,  called  MikhrabyX}Ci2L\.  pre- 
sents itself  to  the  Moslem  mind  in  prayer),  is  gilded, 
and  bears  the  inscription,  "  There  is  no  God  but  God, 
and  Muhammad  is  His  Prophet."  * 

Opposite  the  Shir-Dar  in  the  Rhigistan  our  attention 

•  All  these  medresses,  and,  in  fact,  the  religious  buildings  generally 
of  Central  Asia,  are  ornamented  with  enamel  work  of  the  following 
kinds :  first,  bricks  with  a  smooth  surface  covered  with  a  coat  of  self- 
coloured  enamel.  The  pieces  I  obtained  from  Tamerlane's  tomb  were 
all  of  this  character,  nor  did  I  see  there  any  other.  Secondly,  the  same, 
but  with  two  shades  of  one  colour  in  the  same  brick.  Thirdly,  minute 
pieces  of  brick  about  half  an  inch  thick,  coated  with  self-coloured 
enamel,  fitting  one  into  the  other,  and  arranged  in  mosaic  in  a  bed  of 
plaster.  Of  this  I  secured  a  specimen  10  inches  long  by  7  broad,  the 
colours  of  the  pieces  being  of  dark  blue,  light  green,  two  shades  of 
brownish -yellow,  and  white.  Fourthly,  bricks  with  open  work,  moulded 
or  embossed  on  the  surface,  and  covered  with  a  coating  of  enamel  of 
one  or  more  colours.  These  I  saw  only  at  the  Shah-Zindeh,  where  I 
was  fortunate  in  finding  a  mullah,  who,  in  his  ardour  to  oblige  me,  ran 
and  fetched  a  ladder,  climbed  to  a  loose  brick  we  had  espied  (though 
not  of  open-work)  and  brought  it  down  in  triumph.  Fifthly,  bricks  flat  or 
rounded,  with  smooth  surface,  covered  with  various  designs,  writing,  or 
tracery.  The  piece  secured  by  the  mullah  just  alluded  to  is  of  diamond 
shape,  9  inches  long,  and  an  inch  and  a  quarter  thick,  with  a  design 
in  five  colours,  but  of  rather  coarse  workmanship.  Another  piece  of 
the  same  class,  but  of  finer  workmanship,  obtained  from  the  Tillah- 
Kari,  and  measuring  5  inches  by  4,  has  remains  of  the  gold  visible, 
and  besides  two  shades  of  blue,  light  green,  red,  and  white,  has  what 
looks  like  part  of  a  plum-coloured  flower.     A  third  specimen  of  the 


588  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

was  called  to  a  square,  raised  platform,  and  on  one  of 
its  corners  the  small  conical  tomb  of  a  butcher  who 
supplied  the  workmen  with  their  meat  when  building 
the  medresse.  Schuyler  says  he  frequently  saw  candles 
there  and  other  votive  offerings,  so  that  I  presume  the 
butcher  was  a  saint.  There  are,  it  is  said,  as  many  as 
200  such  aulies  or  shrines  commemorative  of  remark- 
able men  in  Samarkand  and  its  suburbs.  There  are 
also  some  few  other  ancient  but  less  noteworthy  build- 
ings in  and  around  the  city,  such  as  the  tomb  of  the 
giant  Daniar  Palvan,  and  the  ruins  of  the  palace 
Khilvat-Khaneh,  said  to  have  belonged  to  one  of  the 
wives  of  Tamerlane  ;  but  I  think  I  have  said  sufficient 
for  the  present  of  the  Muhammadans  and  their  antiqui- 
ties, and  so  turn  to  the  professors  of  a  more  ancient 

same  class  has  a  white  Arabic  inscription  on  a  dark  brown  ground. 
These  last  two  colours  are  noticeable,  because  M.  Ujfalvy,  who,  as  an 
antiquarian,  went  into  this  matter  somewhat  closely,  afiirms  thab  the 
dark  brown  enamel  is  found  only  at  Afrasiab,  where  I  did  not  go,  whilst 
the  plum -colour  he  does  not  mention  at  all,  but  only  enumerates  blue  of 
the  two  shades  of  turquoise  and  lapis  lazuli,  white,  green,  yellow,  red, 
and  pink  of  many  shades.  My  finest  specimen,  however,  of  this 
class  was  brought  me  by  a  mullah  from  the  Ulug-Beg  medresse,  a 
brick  about  an  inch  thick  and  18  inches  square,  so  tough  that  it  stood 
unbroken  a  journey  of  hundreds  of  miles  across  the  desert,  on  the  back 
of  a  camel,  in  addition  to  the  ups  and  downs  of^the  tarantass  and  railway 
and  steamer  travelling  for  4,000  miles  to  London.  It  has  at  one  side 
a  border  5  inches  wide,  of  light  and  dark  blue,  w^ith  red  and  gold 
colouring,  and  the  remainder  of  the  surface  is  occupied  with  the  lower 
sections  of  tall  Arabic  letters  that  probably  formed  part  of  a  large 
inscription  running  along  a  cornice.  The  bricks  I  obtained  subsequently 
from  Kunia  Urgenj  are  self-coloured,  like  Class  i,  but  measuring 
•J  y.  2\  x  i\  inches,  and  of  great  purity  of  colour ;  also  some  of  Mosaic* 
like  Class  3,  and  a  small  piece  of  Class  5,  only  that  this  last  is  of 
altogether  finer  pencilling.  I  have  thus  described  somewhat  fully  these 
enamels,  because  by  some  writers  they  are  made  much  of,  and  they 
represent  one  of  the  very  few  branches  of  art  to  be  met  with  in  Central 
Asia.  They  are  also  interesting  as  specimens  of  what  could  be  done 
by  Asiatics  500  years  ago,  though  poor  enough  as  compared  with 
Western  productions. 


MUHAMMADAN  AND  JEiVISH  SAMARKAND,    589 

and,  to  me,  more  interesting  religion — namely,  that  of 
the  Central  Asian  Jews. 

We  had  not  been  many  hours  in  Samarkand  before 
we  made  the  acquaintance  of  one  of  the  Jews.  He 
was  on  the  official  staff  of  interpreters,  and  General 
Korolkoff  would  have  sent  him  with  us  for  our  guide 
about  the  town,  but  that  we  had  come  during  the  seven 
days  of  the  Feast  of  Tabernacles,  wherein  their  law  said, 
**  Ye  shall  do  no  servile  work  therein"  (Lev.  xxiii.  36) ; 
and  he  therefore  explained  that  he  could  not  drive  with 
us  to  Tamerlane's  tomb,  though  his  conscience  was  so 
far  unfettered  that  he  expressed  his  willingness  to  walk 
there.  We  therefore  set  out,  and  he  told  us  on  the 
way  how  much  more  strict  in  keeping  their  law  are  the 
Asiatic  than  the  European  Jews.  He  left  us  on  our 
return  from  the  Gur-Emir,  and  we  set  off  to  the 
Rhigistan  with  another  interpreter;  but  after  seeing 
the  three  medresses  and  the  Shah-Zindeh,  already  de- 
scribed, we  went  by  a  cross-cut  to  the  Jews'  quarter, 
and  met  again  the  Jewish  interpreter  at  the  house  of  a 
fellow- Israelite,  Raphael  Moses  Kalendaroff.  I  fancy 
he  was  one  of  their  wealthy  men,  perhaps  he  who  built 
the  synagogue,  for  he  bore  the  same  name,  and  it 
was  in  his  house  we  were  to  see  how  they  kept  the 
Feast  of  Tabernacles. 

In  his  court  or  garden  was  erected  a  cotton  tent,  out- 
side of  which  nothing  might  be  eaten  for  seven  days. 
Here  I  presented  the  Lord  Mayor's  letter  and  the 
introduction  of  the  Moscow  rabbi,  received  at  once  a 
welcome,  and  was  invited  to  eat.  The  ancient  Jewish 
law  directed  (Lev.  xxiii.  39 — 44  ;  Neh.  viii.  14 — 16) 
that  the  people  should  dwell  in  huts,*  which  is  still 
interpreted  to    mean  that  the  roof,   if  not  the  sides, 

*  nap,  not  ?nK,  which  latter  is  a  tent  of  skins  or  cloth. 


590  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

should  be  of  branches  ;  but  these  would  not  be  easily- 
obtained  in  sufficient  quantity  in  Samarkand,  and  I  am 
under  the  impression  that  not  even  the  roof  was  so 
formed.  My  host,  however,  had  remembered  the 
injunction  of  the  law  in  providing,  at  least,  **  the  fruit 
of  goodly  trees,"  if  not  "olive  branches,  and  pine 
branches,  and  myrtle  branches,  and  palm  branches, 
and  willows  of  the  brook."  Perhaps  these  latter  were 
represented  by  the  leafy  decorations  over  our  heads  in 
the  form  of  a  large  framework,  something  like  a  chan- 
delier, from  which  were  hanging  apples,  quinces,  and 
saffron  flowers,  whilst  on  the  carpeted  floor  were  placed 
dishes  of  parched  peas,  pistachio  nuts,  grapes,  peaches, 
and  apples,  as  well  as  mutton  and  carrot  pies,  and 
roasted  apricot  and  plum  kernels.  Many  came  in, 
and,  kneeling  down,  sat  upon  their  haunches,  but  not 
cross-legged,  round  the  four  sides  of  the  tent.  I  began 
at  once  to  ply  them  with  questions  respecting  their 
condition  and  that  of  their  brethren  in  Bokhara.  In 
the  case  of  the  latter  we  heard  again  the  story  related 
at  Khokand,  how  that  the  Bokhariot  Jews  may  not 
build  enough  synagogues  for  their  need,  that  they  may 
not  buy  a  house  from  a  Mussulman  without  the  Emir's 
permission,  that  they  may  not  ride  on  horseback  in  the 
town  of  Bokhara,  that  their  head-covering  must  be  a 
black  calico  cap,  worth  a  few  pence,  and  the  girdle 
about  their  loins,  not  even  of  leather,  but  of  rope  ; 
also  that  when  a  Mussulman  beats  or  insults  a  Jew, 
the  latter  must  always  look  down  and  humbly  submit 
Another  hardship  I  had  not  heard  of  before  was  that 
under  the  Emir  s  government,  if  two  Jews  disagree, 
their  dispute  must  be  settled  by  Mussulman  law ; 
and  my  informants  said  that  so  intimidated  were  the 
Bokhariot   Jews   that   they   dared    not   come   to   ask 


MUHAMMADAN  AND  JEWISH  SAMARKAND.    591 

the  Russians  for  help.  I  inquired  whether  I  could 
do  anything  by  interceding  with  the  Emir  on  their 
behalf,  but  they  said  "  No,"  for  that  such  a  course 
would  only  make  matters  worse. 

On  leaving  the  tent  I  was  invited  to  look  at  a  new 
house  my  host  was  building,  evidently  thought  to  be 
very  grand.  The  many-coloured  decorations  of  the 
walls,  after  the  fashion  of  the  Sarts,  was  the  principal 
feature  that  struck  me,  and  we  then  walked  on  the  flat 


roof,  where  apricots  were  drying  in  the  sun.  We 
could  see  down  into  a  neighbouring  yard,  where  was  a 
young  Jewess,  unveiled.  This  would  have  called  for 
no  remark  in  England,  but  directly  she  caught  sight  of 
me  she  ran  away,  as  if  it  were  improper  to  be  seen 
unveiled  by  a  stranger.  Perhaps  this  would  not  have 
been  so,  however,  had  my  host  been  alone,  as  I  believe 
the  Jewish  women  in  Central  Asia  are  veiled  only  in 
the  streets  to  protect  themselves  from  insult.  On 
leaving,  Moses,  our  Jewish  interpreter,  pressed  us  to 


S92  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

come  and  look  at  his  festal  tent,  which  we  did,  and 
noticed,  among  the  things  suspended,  a  plant  whose 
seeds  were  said  to  cure  squinting. 

We  then  went  to  the  synagogue,  allowed  to  the 
Jews  of  Samarkand  only  since  the  Russians  came, 
where  the  best  chorister  in  the  region  was  that  evening 
to  sing.  The  crowd  was  dense,  and  in  a  short  time 
two  singers  appeared;  ,the  ''prima,''  a  delicate,  modest- 
looking  man,  who  blushed  at  the  eagerness  with  which 
his  arrival  was  awaited,  whilst  the  **  secondo "  was  a 
brazen-faced  fellow,  who  carried  his  head  on  one  side, 
as  if  courting  attention,  and  with  the  assurance  that  he 
should  have  it.  They  were  introduced  to  us,  and 
began  at  once,  that  we  might  hear.  The  singing,  so 
called,  was  the  most  remarkable  that  up  to  that  time  I 
had  ever  heard.  The  first  voice  led  off  in  a  key  so 
high,  that  he  had  to  strain  for  some  seconds  before  he 
could  utter  a  sound  at  all.  After  this  he  proceeded  very 
slowly  as  to  the  number  of  words  he  sang,  but  pro- 
longed his  notes  into  numerous  flourishes,  screaming 
as  loud  as  he  could  in  falsetto.  The  second  voice  was 
an  accompaniment  for  the  first ;  but  as  both  bawled  as 
loudly  as  possible,  I  soon  vot6d  it  anything  but  good 
music,  and  intimated  that  it  was  time  for  us  to  go. 
The  congregation,  moreover,  were  crowding  round, 
without  the  smallest  semblance  of  their  being  engaged 
in  divine  worship.  They  were  anxious  to  detain  us, 
however,  as  long  as  possible,  and  the  rabbi  having 
read  my  documents,  showed  us  such  objects  of  interest 
as  they  possessed  ;  among  others  a  specimen  of  very 
diminutive  writing,  and  he  asked  my  acceptance,  as  a 
souvenir,  of  a  picture,  brought,  I  fancy,  from  Jerusalem, 
and  hanging  in  their  synagogue.  After  this  we  were 
obliged  to  hurry  away,  the  rabbi  urging  us  to  pay  him 


MUHAMMADAN  AND  JEWISH  SAMARKAND,    593 

a  visit,  and  another  Jew  assuring  us  that,  if  we  would 
call  upon  him,  we  should  meet  with  a  better  reception 
than  they  had  been  able  on  that  day  to  give  us. 

We  returned  to  the  palace,  and  next  day  General 
Korolkoff  took  us  to  a  school,  where  we  saw  that  of 
the  T^  boys,  no  less  than  30  were  Jews.  It  was  note- 
worthy, moreover,  that,  as  with  boys  of  the  same  race 
in  Europe,  their  abilities  were  remarkably  good,  putting 
in  the  shade  those  of  their  Russian  and  Sart  school- 
fellows.* I  asked  to  hear  the  Jew  boys  read  ;  but 
here  again  sprung  up  a  question  of  conscience,  or 
rather  of  law,  for  it  was  a  feast  day,  and  though  they 
had  come  to  school  because  ordered  by  the  Russian 
authorities  to  do  so,  {I  suppose  that  I  might  see 
the  school,  for  I  fancy  it  was  a  holiday)  yet  they  might 
not  read,  because  that  would  be  to  work. 

Two  days  later  we  called  on  the  rabbi,  who  was 
still  keeping  the  feast  in  his  tabernacle,  where  he 
received  us,  and  of  whom  I  was  glad  to  make  some 
inquiries  respecting  his  people.  He  said  there  were 
2,500  persons  dwelling  in  400  houses  in  Samarkand. 
He  confirmed  the  traditional  interpretation  I  had  read 
in  Dr.  Wolffs  book,  that  by  the  Habor,  in  2  Kings 
xvii.  6,  and  xviii.  11,  they  understand  Bokhara,  Samar- 
kand, and  the  region  round  about,  t  "  With  reference 
to  the  lost  tribes,  he  related  a  well-known  Jewish 
tradition  that   on  the    Sambation    (|VtD50D,   which   he

and  astrologers  that  were  in  all  his  realm  **  (Dan.  i.  20). 

t  He  offered  no  reason  that  would  at  all  affect,  however,  Canon 
Rawlinson's  statement  in  the  Bible  Dictionary,  that  Habor  is  identified 
beyond  all  reasonable  doubt  with  a  famous  affluent  of  the  Euphrates, 
still  known  as  the  Khabour.

located  in  China,  but  which  others,  I  believe,  affirm  to 
be  in  Africa)  lives  a  people  whom  the  Chinese  call  sons 
of  Abram,  and  that  Mussulmans  profess  to  the  Jews  in 
Samarkand  to  have  seen  their  brethren  in  China  ;  but 
the  Samarkand  Jews  have  not  done  so,  and  for  this 
wonderful  reason,  that  the  aforesaid  river  is  hot  on  six 
days  and  cold  only  on  the  seventh,  on  which  day  it 
would  be  unlawful  for  the  Jews  to  cross  ;  but  the 
Muhammadans,  not  being  similarly  bound,  embrace 
the  opportunity  to  do  so.*  Another  traditional  Israeli- 
tish  story  was  that  Samarkand  had  been  destroyed 
seven  times,  and  that  therein  had  perished  24,000 
Kohanim  Jews,  these  having  had  a  separate  cemetery 
from  the  Israelites.  Tamerlane,  he  informed  me,  was 
said  to  have  brought  from  Meshed  seven  families  of 
Jews,  and  that  their  descendants  were  still  living  at 
Bokhara  and  Samarkand.  But  all  these,  I  fancy,  were 
very  much  of  the  nature  of  **  idle  tales,"  for  the  rabbi 
said  that  the  Jews  had  not  been  in  Samarkand  more 

•  With  this  story  told  to  me  of  Jews  existing  in  China,  which  I  heard 
also  at  Khokand,  it  is  interesting  to  compare  the  account  of  Mr.  Finn, 
respecting  "  the  orphan  colony  of  Jews  "  in  the  city  of  Kae-Fung-Foo, 
who  (in  1870)  were  all  but  absorbed  into  the  surrounding  Chinese  and 
Muhammadans.  Tablets  on  their  synagogue  testified  to  several  migra- 
tions thither,  the  first  in  the  Chow  dynasty  between  B.C.  1122  and 
B.C.  249,  and  a  third  as  late  as  A.D.  1163.  In  1843  a  letter  was 
addressed  to  them,  and  sent  through  the  English  consul  at  Ning-po. 
Five  years  later,  tidings  were  heard  of  the  people ;  and  a  little  later  a 
letter  from  them  was  received,  telling  of  the  decay  of  their  religion  and 
synagogue.  Some  supposed,  from  the  information  given,  that  the 
colony  arrived  from  Khorassan  and  Samarkand  on  the  way  from  Persia, 
because  Persian  words  were  found  in  some  of  the  inscriptions  of  their 
sacred  books.  Messengers  were  sent  to  the  colony  from  Bishop  Smith, 
of  Victoria,  and  some  of  their  Hebrew  writings  purchased.  The  remnant 
of  the  people  was  again  visited  in  1866  by  Dr.  Martin,  an  American 
Presbyterian  missionary,  and  considerable  interest  in  their  desolate 
condition  has  been  shown  by  both  Jews  and  Christians,  though  I  am 
not  aware  that  any  practical  suggestions  on  their  behalf  have  been 
successfully  carried  out. 


MUHAMMADAN  AND  JEWISH  SAMARKAND,    59: 

than  a  century,  and  he  added  that  they  were  from  the 
tribes  of  Reuben,  Gad,  and  the  half  tribe  of  Manasseh. 
The  rabbi  then  said  they  were  Sephardim  or  Spanish, 
and  asked  me  whether  the  English  Jews  were  **  Ashkena- 
zim," — that  is.  Eastern,  like  the  German  Jews, — a 
question  they  quickly  answered  for  themselves  ;  for 
after  asking  the  rabbi  to  repeat  to  me  a  few  verses  in 
Hebrew  from  the  beginning  of  Genesis,  that  I  might 
hear  his  pronunciation,  I  proceeded  to  do  the  same  to 
him.  They  said  at  once  that  my  pronunciation  was  that 
of  the  Ashkenazim.* 

The  rabbi  gave  us  fruit,  and  appeared  quite  to 
expect  ys  to  dine,  but  we  knew  the  General  would  be 
waiting  for  us,  and  so  had  to  ask  to  be  excused. 

Having  thus  described  the  most  ancient  as  well  as 
the  later  monuments  of  the  Muhammadans,  and  alluded 
to  the  Jews  living  in  Samarkand,  I  shall  now  speak  of 
the  modern  town,  as  I  saw  it  under  the  Russians,

ON  Friday,  the  morning  after  our  arrival  at 
Samarkand,  General  Korolkoff  took  us  to  visit 
the  military  hospital.  It  was  situated  without  the 
city  on  the  south-west,  beyond  the  Russian  town, 
having  two  kinds  of  erections — namely,  well-built 
houses  of  brick  for  the  winter,  and  summer  tents, 
from  which  latter  the  patients  were  to  be  transferred, 
if  I  remember  rightly,  on  the  morrow,  September  30th. 
The  general  arrangements  were  similar  to  those  we 
had  seen  at  the  military  hospital  in  Tashkend,  but 
on  a  smaller  scale,  there  being  only  1 1 7  patients. 
The  skin  diseases  were  the  most  interesting,  and 
among  them  a  case  of  reshta  or  kind  of  guinea  worm,

peculiar  to  Bokhara  and  adjacent  towns.  The  medical 
officer  kindly  gave  me  a  specimen  of  the  parasite, 
which  I  brought  safely  to  London.  To  this  I  shal 
return  when  we  reach  its  proper  locality,  Bokhara, 
but  we  saw  likewise  at  Samarkand  several  cases  of  an 
endemic  skin  disease,  common  in  Turkistan,  resembling 
lupus  erythematodes,  ^nd  known  among  the  Russians 
as  Sart  sickness,  or  disease.  It  is  the  Afghan  yaria 
or  plague,  and  is  known  also  as  pasha-khurda,  or 
consuming  fly. 

This  disease,  which  takes  the  form  of  eruptions  of 
the  skin,  prevails  over  a  considerable  portion  of 
Turkistan.  It  more  frequently  appears  on  the  face, 
and  spreads  to  the  upper  extremities,  the  neck,  the 
lower  extremities,  and  the  body  itself.*  Among  natives 
the  disease .  appears  almost  always  during  early  child- 
hood, though  it  is  also  seen  among  adults  of  every 
age  up  to  fifty.  I  had  an  opportunity  of  testing  its 
prevalence  among  children  in  the  boys'  school  at 
Samarkand,  where,  out  of  a  class  of  16,  only  three 
had  escaped,  and  I  was  told  that  the  finer  the  skin 
of  a  child,  the  more  likely  is  it  to  be  attacked.  The 
disease  is  not  painful,  but  sometimes  there  is  experi- 
enced an  uneasiness  or  a  slight  itching.     If  left  alone, 

*  The  disease  is  diagnosed  by  the  appearance  of  a  spot  of  a  round 
or  irregular  shape,  two  to  upwards  of  five  lines  in  diameter.  The  colour 
of  this  spot  is  at  first  slightly  red,  it  then  becomes  a  bright  red,  and 
sometimes  a  reddish  yellow,  and  even  blue.  To  the  touch  the  spot 
seems  most  solid  at  its  edges.  This  thickening,  in  time,  becomes 
knotty,  and  spreads  over  the  surface  of  the  skin.  After  this  follows 
suppuration.  The  sores  issue  from  each  separate  node,  and,  in  propor- 
tion as  these  soften,  run  into  each  other,  until  at  last  they  form  one 
large  and  open  sore.  This  gradually  dries  up,  leaving  a  yellowish 
brown,  or  dark-coloured  scurf.  If  the  disease  be  not  cured,  the  suppu- 
ration will  spread  more  and  more,  but  always  within  ascertainable 
limits.  When  it  heals,  each  wound  leaves  a  scar  or  gash  proportionate 
to  that  of  the  surface  which  the  sore  covered.

the  ailment  will  pass  away  of  itself,  but  it  takes  more 
than  a  year  in  doing  so.* 

On  the  following  day  we  visited  two  hospitals  the 
Russians    have    established    for   native   women    and 

•  The  cause  of  Sart  sickness  was  formerly  imputed  by  Russians 
and  by  natives  alike  to  the  water  they  use,  because  in  the  first  place 
the  disease  usually  attacks  the  face  and  hands  that  are  brought  more 
often  into  contact  than  the  other  parts  of  the  body  with  tainted  water ; 
and  next,  the  disease  oftener  appears  in  June  and  July,  when  the 
water  is  at  the  highest  temperature.  But  the  opinion  is  now  gaining 
ground  that  Sart  sickness  is  disseminated  by  the  transfer  of  poisonous 
matter  from  diseased  to  healthy  organisms,  either  by  indirect  or  direct 
communication.  When  the  Russians  first  came,  and  lodged  in  native 
houses  with  unfavourable  sanitary  conditions,  many  were  attacked, 
but,  with  improved  sanitation  among  Russians,  when  it  now  appears 
it  is  in  a  milder  form.  Sart  sickness  is  a  local  ailment,  requiring 
treatment  according  to  circumstances.  This  treatment  consists  in 
eradicating  the  abnormal  growth,  which  can  be  done  either  with  the 
lancet,  or  by  corrosive  means.  The  latter  is  preferable,  and  the 
following  acids  have  been  employed  : — Ar gen  turn  mtricum.  Kali 
c?tromicum,  Zincum  murmticum.  Kali  causticum,  Mercuritis  frae- 
cipitatus  ruber;  Sodium,  lodo  glicerimuniy  and  Cuprum  sulphuri- 
cum.  Of  all  these,  the  use  of  Kali  causticum  seems  most  to  be 
preferred.  The  scab,  after  the  application  of  caustic,  falls  off  gene- 
rally in  from  7  to  20  days.  If  it  be  desired  to  reapply  the  caustic 
before  the  expiration  of  this  time,  the  scab  can  be  removed  without 
any  trouble  by  smearing  its  surface  over  with  glycerine  or  oil,  and 
then  applying  fomentations.  Native  physicians,  by  whom  at  first 
even  Russian  patients  preferred  to  be  treated,  use  also  corrosive 
sublimate,  vermilion,  arsenic,  copper,  vitriol,  and  Spanish  fly.  These 
they  employ  in  the  simplest  form,  pricking  the  sore  with  a  needle, 
and  rubbing  into  it  powdered  vitriol  or  corrosive  sublimate.  As 
a  rule,  however,  these  caustics  are  but  some  of  the  component 
parts  of  a  plaster,  made  up  also  of  mutton  fat,  castor  oil,  cochineal, 
and  the  resin  of  some  local  tree.  Of  plasters  more  generally  used 
there  are  two  kinds,  in  one  of  which  vitriol  preponderates,  and  in 
the  other  Spanish  fly  and  resin.  The  use  of  vitriol  is  quite  painless. 
The  composition  is  smeared  on  pepper  moistened  with  mucilage, 
and  the  plaster  laid  on  the  sore,  to  be  replaced  after  an  interval  by 
another.  The  application  of  the  Spanish  fly  and  resin  is  resorted  to 
oftener  than  the  first,  but  it  causes  violent  pains  in  the  sore,  and 
reactionary  symptoms,  which,  however,  disappear  in  the  course  of  about 
two  days.  Owing  to  the  presence  of  the  resin,  when  this  plaster  has 
to  be  removed,  force  must  be  used.    This  causes  pain,  and  sometimes

men.*  The  most  interesting  medical  case  was  one  of 
atrophy  of  the  muscles,  that  Mr.  Sevier  called  spas- 
modic paralysis,  arising  from  degeneration  of  the 
lateral  column  of  the  spinal  cord,  a  rare  disease,  and 
recently  studied,  of  which  he  knew  none  to  have  been 
cured,  t  The  hospital  was  particularly  well  built  and 
clean,  the  patients  eating  in  a  common  hall. 

From  the  military  hospital  the  General  took  us  to 
see   two   schools   and  an  asylum,   established  by  the 

considerable  loss  of  blood,  and  always  results  in   the  removal  of  a 
certain   portion    of  the   diseased    surface    adhering    to    the    plaster. 
"Investigations**  upon  this  disease  were  published  by  Dr.  Satinsk 
in  the  Turkistan  Gazette  for  1877,  Nos.  45 — ^48,  and  in  the  Journal  of 
I^ormal  Pharmacopy  and  of  Clinical  Medicine  for  Februar>',  1871. 

♦  Fifteen  patients  in  the  former  were  all  suffering  from  the  effects  of 
prostitution,  and  had  been  sent  by  the  police.  The  women's  hospital 
was  large  and  airy,  in  the  midst  of  a  capital  garden,  with  summer  tent 
covered  with  matting  and  rushes,  but  there  were  no  other  patients,  for 
the  Sarts  generally  do  not  take  to  the  Russian  hospitals  for  women, 
wherein  they  are  treated  by  male  doctors.  There  is  not  the  same 
repugnance  among  the  men,  though  we  found  only  15  in  their  hospital, 
which  was  in  another  part  of  the  town.  Native  patients  are  received 
without  charge.  They  suffer  chiefly  from  fever  of  various  kinds,  some- 
times from  small-pox  ;  five  were  there  with  syphilis  (this  disease 
sometimes  rising  to  a  maximum  48  cases  in  both  hospitals),  and  one 
with  morbus  scrofulosis, 

t  Mr.  Sevier  thought  this  a  remarkable  patient,  and  described  his 
condition  thus:  **  A  case  of  spastic  paralysis  in  the  stage  of  contrac- 
ture. Youth  of  17  years,  very  poor,  used  to  work  very  hard,  living 
chiefly  in  the  streets  by  begging,  exposed  to  all  weathers,  and  some- 
times nearly  starved.  When  brought  to  hospital  he  could  not  walk ; 
his  lower  extremities,  especially  the  muscles  of  calf,  in  a  highly  atrophic 
state,  so  that  the  doctor  diagnosed  only  muscular  atrophy.  On 
examining  him  I  found  him  lying  in  bed  with  his  legs  fixedly  down 
towards  his  buttocks ;  they  were  with  difficulty  stretched,  and  when  let 
loose,  returned  to  their  contracted  position.  The  ankles  also  rigid, 
still  I  produced  capital  ankle  clonus.  All  other  reflexes  much  exagge- 
rated ;  sensory  functions  perfect.  On  trying  to  move  him  I  saw  that 
his  thighs  were  strongly  attracted  to  each  other,  so  that  the  knees 
touched,  and  the  feet  were  also  inverted,  and  the  big  toe  pointed  down- 
wards. Muscles  of  calf  very  much  atrophied,  others  pretty  good ;  no 
myooedema  in  muscles  of  calf.** 


6oo  RUSSIA X  CENTRAL  ASIA 

Russians  in  part  for  the  education  of  natives.     In  the 
boys'   school   were    yj    scholars,    of  whom    22    were 
Russians,  30  Jews,  and  the  remainder  Sarts.     Among 
the  last  was  the  son  of  the  native  police-master  of  the 
Sart  town,   a  boy  of  14,   who  had  been  three*  years 
in    the   school.     He   was   dressed   in   a   khalat,   with 
printed   cotton    trousers,    yellow   boots,    and   a  white 
turban.     He  had,  moreover,  a  watch  and  chain,  and 
was   evidently   a   grandee,    rejoicing  in    the  name  of 
Sevarkul  Bek  Sultanbekoff.    Another  Sart  boy  sported 
a  watch  by  **  John  Salter,  London.^'     I  did  not  gather 
that  the  Sarts  showed  any  extraordinary  capacity,  or 
that  they  were  particularly  keen  for  instruction.     The 
Jewish  boys  in  the  school  mentally  excelled  all  their 
schoolfellows,   and  came  in  goodly  numbers  ;   but  to 
the  girls'  school,  whither  we  next  went,  neither  Sarts 
nor  Jews  would  send   their   daughters,    though   both 
schools  were  free.     This,   I   presume,   would    be  too 
great  an  innovation  on  their  Oriental  ideas.     The  24 
scholars  in  the  girls'  school  were  all  Russian.     Besides 
these  two  institutions,  I  Heard  of  a  boarding-school  in 
Samarkand,    where   the   boys   wear  uniform,   and  we 
visited  an  asylum  for  orphans  and  poor  children,  sup- 
ported   by   voluntary    contributions,    the   funds  being 
raised,  as  so  often  is  the  case  in  Russia,  by  concerts, 
bazaars,  etc.     The  building  contained,  however,  only 
four  girls  and  five  boys.* 

♦  According  to  the  Turkistan  Annual  for  1876  the  number  of 
Russian  schools  throughout  the  province  numbered  3  (the  third  being 
at  Katte- Kurgan),  with  6  teachers,  64  boys,  and  2}^  girls,  maintained 
at  a  cost  of  £2^2^-  Native  education  throughout  the  Zarafshan  province 
was  carried  on  in  1876  in  968  mektebkhana  or  elementary  schools,  and 
in  31  medresses.  There  were  999  teachers,  with  8,642  scholars  in  winter, 
2,266  in  summer.  These  places  of  education  were  situated  in  17  localities, 
or  districts,  and  were  supported  by  the  vaku/s,  or  endowments,  usually 
connected  with  the  colleges ;  or  by  the  communities,  and  in  one  case  by 


RUSSIAN  SAMARKAND.  6oi 

After  visiting  the  schools  we  went  to  the  Bibi- 
Khanum  medresse  and  mosque,  already  described,  and 
then  to  the  citadel,  where  are  the  town  barracks, 
whilst  the  camp  was  situated,  as  we  afterwards  saw, 
1 5  miles  on  the  south  of  the  town. 

Hitherto  I  have  not  said  much  respecting  military 
affairs  in  Russian  Turkistan.  At  the  time  of  my  visit 
all  was  peace,  and  I  cannot  give  with  accuracy  the 
number  of  troops  in  the  various  places  through  which 
I  passed  ;  but  taking  matters  on  a  war-footing,  as  they 
were  in  1877,  and  remembering  that  Turkistan  at  that 
date  included  Semirechia  and  Kuldja,  then  we  have 
for  the  Turkistan  force  some  40,000  troops,  inclusive 
of  non-combatants ;  but  if  we  deduct  the  non-com- 
batants and  the  local  troops,  there  would  be  left  an 
available  field  army  of  25,800.  This  number,  however, 
does  not  include  the  Cossacks,  nor  any  regular  cavalry. 
The  Cossacks  would  add  a  further  force  of  18,500  men 
and  52  guns,  making  in  all  44,000  men  and  1 16  guns. 

In  time  of  peace  the  troops  are  widely  distributed  in 
forts  and  redoubts,  going  under  canvas  in  May  and 
returning  to  barracks  in  September.  .During  these 
concentrations  manoeuvres  are  carried  out,  preparations 
for  which  we  saw  as  we  left  Samarkand.  The  drills 
are  continued  also  after  the  return  to  barracks,  the 
autumn  temperature  being  much  more  favourable  than 
the  summer  heats.  The  Turkistan  forts,  it  may  be 
observed,  are  grouped  in  two  lines,  the  outer  or 
advanced,  and  the  inner  or  reserve  line.* 

the  scholars  themselves.  Their  total  revenue  in  money  amounted  to  ;f  391 , 
and  not  less  than  ^2  tons  of  com,  though  how  much  more  one  cannot  say, 
since  it  is  common  for  parents  to  send  presents  to  the  teacher  of  food,  and 
even  clothing.  Moreover,  these  revenues  are  not  exclusively  for  the 
teachers,  but  are  in  some  cases  shared  by,  and  in  one  case  taken  wholly 
by  the  scholars. 
*  On  the  advanced  line  there  are  usually  two  or  three  fortified  points 


6o2  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

I  have  from  time  to  time  examined  the  arms  of  the 
Cossacks,  and  found  them  very  dissimilar.  Among  the 
Siberian  Cossacks  the  flint  firelock  may  still  be  found. 
In  Turkistan  they  have,  or  had  until  quite  recently, 
carbines  of  1 8 1 8,  dragoon  carbines  with  bayonets,  etc. 
The  rifle  brigade  are  armed  with  the  Berdan  rifle  of 
1868,  the  frontier  battalions  and  local  troops  with  the 
Carl  rifle,  and  the  sapper  company  with  the  Krinka 
rifle.  Field  artillery,  and  also  the  mountain  battery, 
have  breech-loading  guns.  The  provisioning  of  the 
troops  with  warlike  stores  is  effected  from  Tashkend, 
but  with  many  drawbacks.  All  the  cartridges  and 
ammunition  are  brought  from  Russia,  for  though  there 
is  lead  in  the  Kara-Tau  mountains,  it  is  found  more 
advantageous  to  bring  it  from  Russia.  So,  for  the 
same  reason,  the  deficiency  of  wood  for  artillery  pur- 
poses has  to  be  met  by  Russian  supplies. 

The  appearance  of  the  Turkistan  soldier  differs 
widely  from  that  of  his  compatriot  in  Europe.  For 
the  greater  part  of  the  year  he  wears  a  linen  blouse, 

on  the  frontier  of  each  khanate.  Thus  Khiva  is  dominated  by  Petro- 
Alexandrovsk,  and  Nukus,  a  redoubt ;  Bokhara  by  Samarkand  and 
Katte- Kurgan ;  Kashgar  by  forts  at  Karakol,  Naryn,  ^Muzart,  and 
Gulsha ;  and  Kuldja  by  the  redoubts  at  Bakhty  and  Borokhudzir.  The 
inner  forts  are  those  at  Kazala,  Perovsky,  Julek,  Turkistan,  Chimkent, 
Khojend,  Aulie-Ata,  Tokmak,  Viemy,  Kopal,  and  Sergiopol.  The  garri- 
sons in  these  outer  forts,  with  certain  exceptions,  usually  consist  of  a  com- 
pany, or  sometimes  even  half  a  sotnia  (half  a  hundred)  only  of  Cossacks, 
whilst  the  garrisons  of  the  forts  of  the  inner  line  are  still  smaller.  Tash- 
kend is  the  central  point,  wherein  is  concentrated  the  bulk  of  the  troops 
forming  a  reserve  to  the  whole  of  the  advanced  line.  The  distribution 
of  the  advanced  forts  in  Russian  Turkistan  therefore  is  along  a  semi- 
circular arc,  convex  towards  the  enemy,  the  forts  of  the  inner  line  being 
disposed  along  a  parallel  arc.  The  forts  of  the  inner  line,  moreover, 
are  connected  by  a  post- road,  from  which  other  roads  branch  off  to  the 
outer  arc.  The  Turkistan  forts  have  been  either  erected  by  the  Russians, 
chiefly  among  the  nomads,  or  have  been  adapted  from  native  fortifica- 
tions. Neither  could  offer  resistance  to  Europeans,  but  they  present  a 
sufficient  obstacle  to  a  Central  Asian  foe.

with  cloth  shoulder-straps,  chamois  leather  trousers 
dyed  red,  and  a  white  cap  with  a  flap,  believed  to 
shield  the  back  of  the  head  from  the  sun's  rays. 
Instead  of  a  knapsack  he  carries  a  linen  haversack.* 
We  were  thrown  into  the  company  of  a  good  many 
officers  in  Turkistan,  and  the  impression  they  left  on  my 
mind  was  favourable. f  I  thought  Russians  seemed 
rather  fond  of  telling  us  that  many  of  the  Turkistan 
officers  were  of  questionable  character,  having  squan- 
dered their  fortune  in  vicious  living  at  Petersburg,  and 
then  come  to  Central  Asia  to  recover  themselves. 
Others,  again,  were  supposed  to  be  there  for  the  extra 
pay,  and  the  opportunities  in  war  time  of  rapid  advance- 
ment. Drunkenness,  the  report  says,  is  the  chief  vice 
among  the  troops,  and  the  great  majority  of  crimes 
and  offences  are  committed  by  the  men  in  this  state. 
During   the   severe   expedition   to    Khiva,    when  the 

•  The  leather  trousers,  called  chambar,  were  adopted  from  the 
natives ;  they  are  durable,  cool  in  summer,  and  protect  the  legs  from 
spear  grass.  Cossacks,  instead  of  the  linen  blouse,  wear  shirts  of  camel's 
hair,  called  armiachina.  The  food  also  of  the  Turkistan  soldier  is  dif- 
ferent, in  that  he  has  wheaten  flour  instead  of  Russian  rye ;  groats 
are  likewise  issued,  millet,  barley,  and  rice.  Biscuit  is  prepared  by 
baking  in  the  oven  or  baking  in  the  sun.  The  latter  method  is  usually 
adopted  during  the  very  hot  weather  for  the  preparation  of  a  ten-days' 
supply.  Wheaten  cakes  are  spread  on  reed  mats,  and  exposed  on  the 
house-roofs  for  two  days  to  the  sun's  rays.  This  sun-dned  biscuit  does 
not  swell  to  the  same  extent  as  that  baked  in  the  oven,  and  becomes 
more  easily  damaged  during  transport.  Provisions  are  furnished  by 
contract,  the  price  of  wheat  varying  from  4J.  to  5J.  per  cwt.  in  Tashkend, 
to  2od.  in  Aulie-Ata,  and  barley  from  u.  &/.  to  3J.  4//.  per  cwt. 

t  The  officers  of  the  artillery  and  engineers  receive  instruction  in 
special  schools,  as  do  also  about  60  per  cent,  of  the  rifle  brigade.  In 
the  frontier  and  local  battalions  the  percentage  of  officers  who  have 
passed  the  course  at  a  university,  war-school,  cadet-school,  or  gym- 
nasium, is  much  less,  yet  the  proportion  is  more  than  one-third ;  the 
remainder  having  been  educated  at  three-class  schools  or  privately. 
The  Cossack  officers  are  much  behind  the  others  in  intellectual  cultiva- 
tion. The  moral  standard  of  the  officers  was  officially  described  in  1877 
as  **  tolerably  satisfactory.*' 


6o4  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

troops  were  forbidden  the  use  of  spirits,  and  a  ration  of 
tea  issued  instead,  offences,  it  was  said,  were  rare.* 

We  saw  near  Samarkand  a  number  of  flat  targets  to 
represent  soldiers  drawn  up  in  line  of  battle  to  be  shot 
at  for  practice  in  three  ways,  at  the  head,  at  half  the 
body,  and  the  whole  body,  at  various  distances  from 
I  GO  up  to  i,CKDO  yards.  Had  we  stopped  a  few  days 
longer  we  could  have  seen  some  practice,  but  now  I 
can  only  quote  my  last  statistics,  to  the  effect  that  in 
ball  practice  the  rifle  battalions  head  the  list  with  the 
predicates  of  **  very  good  *'  and  **  excellent,"  the  practice 
of  the  rest  of  the  army  being  less  satisfactory.  Thus 
in  the  case  of  the  frontier  battalions  in  1873  ^he  average 
number  of  hits  at  100  paces  was  58  per  cent.,  at  200 
paces  46  per  cent.,  at  280  paces  41  per  cent.,  at  400 
paces  36  per  cent.,  and  at  600  paces  29  per  cent. 

The  same  day  on  which  we  visited  the  citadel,  with 
its  barracks  and  soldiers,  we  saw  also  the  bazaar.  This 
building  suffered  a  good  deal  at  the  time  of  the  Russian 
conquest,  and  has  been  to  some  extent  rebuilt.  There 
remains,  however,  a  large  octagonal  building  belonging 
to  the  old  bazaar,  wherein  we  bought  skull-caps  and 
some  native  olive-green  snuff,  and  small  gourds  that 
serve  for  snuff-boxes.  Samarkand  does  a  considerable 
trade  in  cotton,  silk,  wheat,  and  rice,  also  in  knives, 
fruits,  horses,  sheep,  and  mules.  Wheat,  rice,  and  silk 
are  exported  principally  to  Bokhara.     The  cotton  is 

*  Dr.  Schuyler  mentions  that  he  very  frequently  indeed  saw  drunken 
soldiers  in  Turkistan.  I  am  glad  to  add  that  I  did  not ;  so  that  I  should 
hope  the  report  under  this  head  in  1877  was  a  true  one,  namely,  **  The 
discipline  of  the  men  is  improving  each  year."  The  total  number  of 
men  punished  in  Turkistan  in  1873  was  about  ij  per  cent,  of  the  average 
number  of  effectives.  I  have  no  recent  statistics,  but  the  report  says 
that  the  local  authorities  were  striving  to  establish  canteens  where  the 
men  might  pass  their  leisure  hours  in  drinking  tea,  and  I  have  already 
referred  to  the  efforts  of  Colonel  Serpitzky  for  his  men  at  Tashkend. 


RUSSIAN  SAMARKAND.  605 

sent  through  Tashkend  to  Russia.  From  the  Bokhariot 
province  of  Shahr-i-sabz,  lying  south  of  Samarkand,  they 
bring  wheat,  excellent  fruits,  including  pomegranates, 
and  pomegranate  rind  for  making  a  red  dye,  likewise 
silk  webs.  From  the  province  of  Hissar  is  brought 
salt,  well  known  for  its  excellent  quality.  The  bazaar 
is  seen  to  greatest  advantage  on  market  days,  that 
is  Thursdays  or  Sundays,  when  the  principal  street 
from  the  place  Bibi-Khanum  to  the  Rhigistan  is  so 
full  that  there  is  hardly  room  to  move,  chiefly  men, 
amongst  whom  there  is  scarcely  a  woman  to  be  met. 
There  were  exposed  for  sale  Bokhara  velvets  of  very 
original  patterns  and  brilliant  colours.  I  bought  hand- 
kerchiefs of  thick  silk  from,  I  suppose,  Hissar,  and 
something  more  curious  in  the  form  of  a  native 
enamelled,  wooden  saddle,  with  a  high  pointed  pommel, 
similar  to  the  form  used  in  Mexico. 

The  number  of  houses  in  Samarkand  is  4,411,  of 
which  200  belong  to  Russians.  The  population  is 
computed  at  about  36,000,  of  whom  5,400  are  Euro- 
peans, and  30,600  natives.  The  industries  of  the  town 
are  found  in  the  factories,  looms,  workshops,  and  other 
industrial  and  trade  institutions  that  occupy  the  Asiatic 
quarter,  and  closely  resemble  those,  of  which  I  gave  a 
list,  in  Tashkend.  It  should  be  observed,  however, 
that  the  products  are  very  inferior  to  those  made  in 
Europe,  the  implements  in  use  in  the  factories  being 
of  the  most  primitive  and  unsatisfactory  kind.  The 
Tajiks  form  by  far  the  largest  proportion  of  the  popu- 
lation, and  represent  pre-eminently  the  industrial  class. 
They  weave  and  knit,  do  blacksmith's  and  copper- 
smith's work,  tanning,  carpentry,  joinery,  and  turnery, 
also  boot-making,  harness  and  saddle-making,  as  well 
as  dyeing,  pottery,  and  needlework. 


6o6  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

The  Tajiks  weave  both  silk  and  cotton,  but  rarely 
hair  or  wool,  except  in  the  mountains.* 

On  the  third  day  of  our  sojourn  in  Samarkand 
we  visited  the  prison,  which  I  shall  describe  here- 
after. I  may  here  mention,  however,  concerning  the 
principal  feeders  of  the  prisons — I  mean  the  public- 
houses — and  also  a  propos  of  the  drunkenness  alleged 
above  to  be  the  prime  cause  of  military  offences,  that 

♦  Among  their  products,   called  by  their  native   names,    are  the 
following: — i.  Alatcha^  a  cotton  material  striped  with  various  colours, 
some  of  which  is  glazed.     When  made  of  foreign  thread  it  is  called 
A  latcha-feringi,    A  workman  can  weave  about  9  yards  of  alatcha  in 
a  day,  and  receives  2\d,  for  his  wages.    A  jura  (/>.,  a  piece)  of  alatcha 
costs  from  u.  8^.  to  4J.  lod.y  or  alatcha-feringi  from  12s.  to  its, ;  and 
an  adult  male  Tajik  needs  from  three  to  four  pieces  of  alatcha  in  a 
year.     2.  Kalama,  a  white  cotton  material  with  stripes,  usually  of 
blue,  red,  or  yellow,  of  which  men  use  about  four  pieces  a  year,  and 
women  one,  costing  2S.  ^d.  a  piece.    3.  Fata  is  a  small  thin-checked 
cotton  material,  used  for  turbans  and  for  girdles,  made  in  about  40 
weaving  shops  in  Samarkand,  a  weaver  making  a  piece,  5  yards  long, 
in  2  days,  and  thus  earning  'j\d.    For  turbans  two  pieces  are  joined ; 
for  a  girdle  one  piece  suffices.     Women  do  not  wear  this  material  at 
all,  and  a  piece  lasts  a  man  from  2  to  3  years.     4.  Khosa  is  a  white 
cotton  material,  used  for  shrouds,  for  turbans,  and  the  lining  of  good 
robes ;  8  yards  cost  from  10^.  to  \s.    There  are  in  Samarkand  200  work- 
shops for  making  khosa,  some  of  which  is  exported  to  Bokhara  and 
Khiva.    Turkoman  women,  and  the  poorest  of  the  Tajiks  in  Zarafshan, 
make  their  turbans  of  it.     5.  Pianja  is  the  same  material  but  wider. 
6.  Daka  is  a  stout  cotton  cloth  of  imported  thread ;  little  of  it  is  made 
in  Samarkand.     A  workman  earns  td.  for  making  7  yards.     7.  Tibit- 
salyi{i.e.f  Wool-turban)  is  a  fabric  with  cotton  warp  and  woollen  weft, 
used  for  turbans  and  girdles.    The  Samarkand  weavers  learned  the  art 
of  making  it  about  40  years  since  from  Ura-Tiube.     The  length  of  a 
piece  is  from  4  to  16  yards ;  a  workman  makes  7  yards  in  a  day  for  6d. 
It  costs  at  the  rate  of  from  2S.  to  los,  for  12  yards.    8.  Pari-pasha  is 
a  silk  or  half-silken  material,  worn  by  women  for  robes,  and  is  usually 
white  and  blue.    9.  Pasma  and  biko-sab  are  similar,  but  the  former 
with  wide,  the  latter  with  narrow  stripes.     10.  Adrias  ^n^Al-Chimbar 
(the  latter,  I  presume,  for  making  trousers)  differ  in  width,  adrias  being 
10  inches,  and  the  other  18  inches  wide.     Of  semi- silken  fabrics  gene- 
rally, it  should  be  observed  that  they  are  watered,  something  after  the 
style  of  moiri  antique ^  by  special  workmen  in  the  bazaars.    The  instru- 
ment by  which  this  pattern  is  produced  is  called  a  kudung.     It  is

in  the  Zarafshan  province  for  six  years,  1868—1873, 
the  number  of  public-houses,  wine-cellars,  distilleries, 
and  breweries,  progressed  in  the  following  order  : — 
3,  5,  10,  45,  53,  40.*  These  figures  relate,  I  believe, 
to  the  Russian  population,  since  the  Mussulmans  are 
supposed  to  be,  and  for  the  most  part  are,  abstainers 
from  intoxicating  drinks. 

On  returning  each  day  to  the  palace  after  our  sight- 
seeing and   researches,  we  were   favoured   at  dinner 

a  tolerably  weighty  hammer  with  a  rounded  projection  of  hard  wood 
called  ztran,  that  grows  in  the  Zarafshan  district,  whilst  the  table  on 
which  the  material  is  spread  has  likewise  rounded  eminences  of  ziran, 
Basma,  or  cloth  of  camels'  hair  for  winter  clothing,  is  largely  prepared 
in  Ura-Tiube,  and  is  usually  of  cinnamon  colour,  or  of  black.  Basma^ 
i'tibit  is  similar,  but  being  half  of  wool  is  much  finer  and  better  looking. 
Kokma^  or  camlet,  which  may  be  of  camels*  hair,  or  wool  of  goat  or 
sheep,  is  principally  produced  by  the  nomads,  especially  by  the  Kirghese 
of  Semirechia.  Koshma,  or  felt,  is  one  of  the  necessities  of  Central 
Asian  nomad  life,  whilst  there  are  three  kinds  of  carpet  held  in  esteem, 
Mashata  (from  Meshed  ?),  y^^/Vzad^,  or  Turkoman,  and  Ah-chatchak, 
from  Khokand.  There  is  a  carpet,  without  pile,  called  Falas^  prepared 
in  Kurama,  Khojend,  and  to  some  extent  in  the  Zarafshan  district,  and 
the  Uzbegs,  wintering  in  the  direction  of  the  Urmitan  pass,  make  ex- 
cellent carpets  called  gelynty  with  long  downy  nap.  Another  material 
prepared  by  the  Tajiks,  but  not  yet  mentioned,  is  Kdnaus,  of  three 
kinds,  smooth,  striped,  and  printed,  and  they  also  knit  stockings.  A 
pair  of  the  latter  I  bought  in  Tashkend,  of  cinnamon  colour,  were  said 
to  be  of  fibre  from  bark  ;  they  were  supposed  to  be  warm,  and  cost  ^s,, 
but  I  am  uncertain  whether  they  were  of  Russian  or  native  make. 

♦  These  are  statistics  compiled  by  M.  Virsky  in  the  Turkistan 
Annual  for  1876,  whilst  the  Turkistan  Calendar  for  1879  gives 
information  concerning  distillation  and  the  drink  traffic  in  Turkistan ; 
that  there  were  used  for  distilling,  in  1875-6,  of  rye  flour  2^]*]  tons,  wheat 
flour  489  tons,  rice  89  tons,  and  malt  132  tons.  Also  that  in  1876  there 
were  issued  from  the  cellars  of  the  distilleries  73,262  gallons  of  spirit. 
Of  beer  and  mead  breweries,  in  1876,  there  were  10 ;  of  works  for  making 
vodka  from  grapes  and  firuit  7 ;  and  from  wine  8.  The  number  of 
licenses  issued  in  the  latter  half  of  the  year  to  houses  in  which  drink 
was  sold  was  71 ;  wine-cellars  160;  beershops  35  ;  that  is,  266  places 
for  the  sale  of  alcoholic  drink,  whilst  the  licenses  for  tea-houses  and 
buffets  numbered  76.  The  number  of  distilleries  in  1876-7  was  6,  and 
fermenting  cellars  35,  with  a  capacity  of  58,000  gallons.

with  the  presence  of  General  Korolkoff,  and  sometimes 
of  his  brother,  Colonel  Korolkoff,  Colonel  Alexandroff, 
and  others  ;  and  as  the  acting  Governor  was  well 
posted  in  the  affairs  of  his  province,  I  gained  from 
him  a  great  deal  of  information,  especially  in  matters 
that  touched  at  all  upon  botany  and  agricultural 
produce.  There  are  in  the  province  4,475  square 
miles  of  irrigated  land,  and  of  non-irrigated  35,804. 
They  have  not  much  black  -earth,  but  very  fertile, 
argillaceous  loess,*  which  in  certain  places,  when  there 
is  plenty  of  rain,  has  been  known  for  one  bushel  of 
wheat  sown  to  yield  90  bushels ;  even  where  the 
ground  is  not  much  worked,  but  irrigated,  the  yield 
is  from  40  to  45-fold,  and  on  an  average  the  cultivated 
land  throughout  the  country  gives  a  20-fold  crop.f 

I  have  already  mentioned  the  wild  trees  of  Turkistan 
generally,  and  need  only  add  that  in  the  Zarafshan 
province  they  have  at  least  three  species  of  juniper 
(y.  pseudO'Sabina,  J.  foetidissima,  J,  kokanicd),  the 
birch,  pistachio  {Pistackia  vera),  and  whole  forests  of 

•  Loess,  or  inundation-mud,  a  fluviatile  loam,  belongs  to  the  plei- 
stocene period  of  Lyell,  and  analysis  shows  its  composition  to  agree  with 
that  of  the  mud  of  the  Nile — about  one-sixth  part  is  carbonate  of  lime. 
Enormous  deposits,  several  hundred  feet  thick,  and,  with  rare  exceptions, 
"unstratified,  are  found  in  the  valley  of  the  Rhine,  between  Bingen  and 
Basle.  The  characteristic  shells  (terrestrial,  fresh-water,  and  amphi- 
bious moUusks)  are  Succinea  elongata^  Pupa  tnuscorum,  and  Helix 
hispida,  Mr.  Delmar  Morgan  refers  to  Baron  Richtofen*s  "China" 
for  interesting  remarks  on  the  physical  history  of  the  Aralo-Caspian 
basin,  especially  in  its  relation  to  human  settlement. 

t  In  the  autumn  they  sow  barley  and  wheat,  harvest  it  in  Maj',  and 
in  June  sow  with  rice,  or  the  same  crop  again,  to  be  cut  in  October. 
They  also  sow,  after  barley  and  wheat,  sorghum,  soya  hispiday  sesamum 
orientale  (for  oil),  melons,  water-melons,  cucumbers,  carrots,  and  other 
vegetables.  They  cultivate  cotton  {gossyptutn  herbaceutn)  in  summer, 
but  no  hops.  The  yield  of  rice  is  30- fold,  and  in  special  cases  83 -fold 
has  been  reaped.  Of  sorghum,  which  they  plant  to  cut  green  for  fodder, 
one  ton  yields  400.  This  sorghum  sells  for  u.  \\d,  to  2S,  4^/.,  barley

sycamore  {Platanus  orientalis)  and  almond  trees  ;  many 
species  of  cherry  and  plum,  apples,  pears,  apricots,  and 
willows  ;  certain  kinds  of  elm  [Ulmus  campestrtSy  etc.), 
and  walnut  {Jug/ans  regia),  but  no  oaks.  To  these  may 
be  added  one  kind  of  CeltiSy  Zizyphus  sativa,  the  vine, 
clematis,  and  roses.  They  have  the  euonymus,  some 
species  of  spiraea,  two  kinds  of  ivy,  and  several  species 
of  ferns.  The  General  told  me  that  he  had  found  in 
the  mountains  a  very  pretty  maiden-hair  fern,  and  an 
evergreen  fern-tree  from  12  to  18  inches  in  height. 
The  Osmunda  rega%  he  said  was  not  found  there. 

Besides  these  subjects  of  general  interest,  we  dis- 
cussed my  future  journey.  Thus  far  I  had  accomplished 
a  posting  journey  of  about  .2,800  miles  by  the  hire  of 
upwards  of  800  horses,  and  the  question  now  arose 
as  to  how  I  was  to  proceed  to  Bokhara.  The  direct 
road,  that  might  be  traversed  in  the  tarantass,  was 
through  Daul  and  Chimbai  to  Katte- Kurgan  on  the 
frontier,  a  distance  of  43  miles,  for  which  one  could  get 
post-horses;  but  for  the  remaining  100  miles  to  Bokhara 
there  were  no  post-horses ;  and  if  any  animals  could  be 
hired,  it  would  be  to  Bokhara  only,  and  not  beyond 
I  was  specially  desirous,  however,  to  have  an  interview 
with  the  Emir,  who  was  staying  for  the  summer  at 
Shahr-i-sabz,  to  which  the  nearest  route  lay  over  a 
mountain  road,  impassable  for  wheeled  vehicles.  I 
determined,  therefore,  to  go  on  horseback  to  Shahr-i- 
sabz,  and  to  send  my  tarantass  to  await  me  at  Karshi, 
which  I  should  have  to  go  through  on  my  roundabout 
road  to  Bokhara. 

Having  thus  determined,  it  was  necessary  to  buy 
two  horses  for  myself  and  Mr.  Sevier,  and  to  purchase 
or  hire  a  sumpter  horse  for  baggage.  Several  were 
brought   for  inspection  to  the  palace  after  lunch  on 

VOL.  I.  39 


6io  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

Saturday,  and  I  fixed  upon  two  stallions,  a  chestnut 
for  myself,  and  a  black  for  Mr.  Sevier,  at  what  I 
thought  the  wonderfully  cheap  price  of  £^  1 2^.  for  the 
two.  Just  as  the  bargain  was  being  struck,  a  native 
rode  up  on  a  tall,  graceful  creature  worthy  of  Rotten 
Row,  for  which  he  asked  ;^io.  Had  1  wanted  one 
for  pleasure  only,  or  to  bring  to  England,  I  should 
have  chosen  this,  but  we  were  advised  that  our  former 
choice  was  better  for  the  work  before  us.  My  horse 
in  particular  was  pronounced  to  be  excellent,  and  in 
the  course  of  the  afternoon  we  rode  out  to  try  our 
steeds,  and  took  the  opportunity  to  call  on  the  Uyezdi 
nachalniky  M.  George  Alexevitch  Arendarenko,  who 
very  obligingly  offered  to  place  at  my  disposal  two 
djiguitts,  who  might  accompany  us  as  far  as  the  Oxus. 
This  was  a  great  kindness,  the  full  value  of  which  I 
did  not  realize  at  first.  Besides  this,  M.  Arendarenko 
gave  us  advice  as  to  our  proceedings,  and  certain 
points  of  Oriental  etiquette  to  be  observed  in  Bokhara. 
It  was  further  necessary  to  secure  an  interpreter  who 
could  speak  Russian  and  Turki,  and  I  should  have  been 
well  pleased  to  take  the  Jewish  official  interpreter, 
to  whom  I  have  alluded,  but  he  could  not  leave  during 
the  feast,  so  General  Korolkoff  kindly  found  for  us 
a  Tatar,  who  spoke  Russian  and  Turki  and  Tajik 
besides.  This  was  so  far  well ;  but  as  we  should  be 
entirely  at  the  mercy  of  this  man,  it  was  a  comfort 
when  M.  Arendarenko  called  upon  us,  and  said  that 
one  of  our  native  djiguitts  spoke  also  Russian,  so 
that,  if  the  interpreter  did  not  comport  himself  satisfac- 
torily, we  might  send  him  about  his  business.  As 
we  were  leaving  Russian  territory,  I  supposed  it 
would  be  necessary  to  change  my  Russian  roubles 
into  the   gold   and   silver  coin    of  Bokhara,    though 


RUSSIAN  SAMARKAND.  6ii 

Colonel  Alexandroff,  who  dined  with  us  from  the 
camp,  said  he  had  passed  from  Khiva  to  Bokhara 
and  found  Russian  money  received  in  payment  every- 
where. I  thought  perhaps  his  uniform  might  have 
something  to  do  with  it,  but  when  the  money-changer 
came  to  the  palace  with  his  gold  tillahs,  my  native 
interpreter  seemed  also  to  think  it  quite  needless  for 
me  to  take  them,  and  I  changed  only  the  trifling 
amount  of  ;^20,  for  which  I  was  given  in  silver 
764  tengas,  and  offered  in  gold  30  tillahs,  equal  to 
13^.  4^.  each,  and  50  kopecks.  My  tengas,  therefore, 
cost  me  6^d.  each.  The  money-changer  was  not  the 
only  mercantile  visitor  we  received  at  the 'palace,  for 
when  it  became  known  that  I  was  interested  in  anti- 
quities, an  old  Khoja  and  another  native  brought 
some  ancient  coins,  which  I  purchased,  and  the  Khoja 
said  that  19  miles  from  Bokhara,  on  the  Oxus,  is  a 
well,  called  Magallel  Kuju-baun,  at  which  formerly  was 
a  town  called  Seevineh  ;  that  when  the  sand  is  blown 
away,  it  leaves  ruins  bare,  and  those  who  go  there 
for  fodder  sometimes  find  money  and  rings.  He  sold 
me  a  small  cameo  that  he  said  had  been  found  there 
which  has  on  it  a  stag  or  hare  running,  whence  I 
conclude  it  to  be  of  Greek  workmanship,  since  the 
Muhammadan  natives  of  Bokhara  do  not  depict  living 
creatures.  The  Khoja  said  that,  were  he  not  so 
old,  he  should  be  well  pleased  to  go  with  us  as  inter- 
preter, since  he  knew  the  country  well.  Other  anti- 
quities were  brought  us  willingly  by  the  mullahs  of 
enamelled  bricks,  and  when  to  a  sum  of  money  I 
added,  as  a  present,  an  Arabic  New  Testament  or 
Turkish  Gospel,  they  expressed  their  gratitude.  In 
fact,  I  went  on  Sunday  afternoon  to  the  Tillah-Kari 
medresse,  and  gave  a  Persian   Bible  for  the  use  of 


6x2  JiUSSIAN-  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

the  mullahs.  They  thanked  me  much,  and  when  we 
walked  on  to  the  Shir-Dar,  and  gave  an  Arabic  New 
Testament,  they  were  equally  obliged.  Another  thing 
to  be  thought  of  was  that,  on  leaving  Samarkand,  we 
were  going  not  only  out  of  the  postal  union,  but  of 
the  postal  region,  and  that  we  must  accordingly  make 
up  our  minds  to  be  for  a  while  dead  to  the  civilized 
world,  and  the  world  to  us.  As  it  was,  I  had  received 
no  communications  from  Europe  since  leaving  Tiumen, 
though  I  had  despatched  many  to  England  ;  and  when 
I  had  finally  made  up  my  mind  to  enter  Bokhara,  I 
telegraphed  to  London  from  Samarkand,  at  a  cost  of 
24^.,  ''  All  well.  Leave  in  three  days  for  Bokhara 
and  Khiva.  Found  no  letters  at  Tashkend.  Expect 
me  in  December,'*  thinking  that  this  date  would  give 
an  ample  margin  for  my  return,  but  really  expecting 
to  be  home  before. 

During  our  stay  at  the  palace,  we  of  course  learned 
more  of  General  Ivanoff,  our  absent  host,  whom  we 
had  left  at  Tashkend.  He  was  spoken  of  to  us  as 
being  of  remarkably  even  temper,  as  never  angry  nor 
particularly  pleased,  showing  neither  satisfaction  nor 
displeasure.  He  was  said  to  have  great  powers  of 
endurance.  An  instance  was  quoted  of  his  riding 
from  Petro-Alexandrovsk,  where  he  was  governor, 
to  Nukus,  a  distance  of  116  miles,  staying  for  2  hours 
only,  and  then  returning,  doing  the  233  miles  in  about 
36  hours,  and  then  setting  to  work  reading  and 
writing  immediately.  His  bravery,  too,  was  spoken 
of  in  terms  equally  high.  At  the  taking  of  Khiva, 
he  and  nine  others  were  surrounded  in  fight  by  Turko- 
mans, and  he  was  wounded  in  the  arm  ;  also  by  a 
ball  passing  through  under  his  knee-cap,  and  another 
through  his  regimental  cap,  cutting  open  the  scalp  ;

but  even  then  he  was  said  to  have  declined  having  his 
own  wounds  dressed  till  he  had  looked  after  the  welfare 
of  those  wounded  with  him.  I  did  not  realize  at 
Tashkend  that  I  had  read  of  him  as  Colonel  Ivanoff, 
the  Governor  at  the  fortress  to  which  Colonel  Burnaby 
was  brought  after  his  **  ride  to  Khiva,"  or  that  he 
was  the  same  who  generously  gave  up  to  MacGahan 
a  portion  of  his  tent  in  the  Khivan  campaign ;  but  I 
shall  not  soon  forget  his  kindness  in  giving  us  quarters 
at  his  house,  and  doing  so  much  to  render  pleasant 
our  stay  at  Samarkand. 

Having  now  brought  the  reader  through  the  whole 
of  the  provinces  that  make  up  Russian  Central  Asia, 
and  having  described  how  the  invaders  advanced  up 
the  Irtish  to  occupy  Semirechia,  I  shall  next  briefly 
sketch  their  advance  up  the  Syr-daria,  and  the  Russian 
occupation  of  Turkistan.

I  HAVE  described  in  a  previous  chapter  the  Russian 
advance  to  the  Syr-daria,  on  whose  banks  in 
1847  they  built,  without  opposition  Fort  Raim,  subse- 
quently called  Aralsk.  Thus  far  the  Cossacks  had 
made  their  way  through  the  country  of  the  wandering 
Kirghese,  but  now  they  were  to  meet  with  people,  the 
Khokandians  and  Khivans,  who  had  "  a  local  habita- 
tion and  a  name/*  At  the  beginning  of  the  present 
century  the  Khokandians,  as  I   have  shown,  captured 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  TURKISTAN.     615 

the  Hazret-i-Turkistan,  and  afterwards  they  began  to 
interfere  with  the  neighbouring  Kirghese  Kazaks,  and 
to  demand  from  them  tribute.  In  furtherance  of 
this  the  Khokandians  erected  fortresses  on  the  Syr 
below  Turkistan,  at  Djany-Kurgan,  Julek,  Ak-Mesjed, 
Kumysh-Kurgan,  Chim-Kurgan,  and  Kosh-Kurgan ; 
and  inasmuch  as  the  Kirghese  were  wont  to  spend 
their  winters  in  the  neighbourhood  of  these  forts,  they 
were  compelled  to  submit  to  Khokandian  rule  and  pay 
the  tribute  demanded. 

The  ascendency  thus  gained  over  the  Kazaks  by 
the  Khokandians  in  the  east  excited  the  Khivans  to 
attempt  the  same  from  the  west.  They  began  by 
demanding  that  the  Khokandian  forts  should  be 
destroyed ;  and  when  this  was  refused,  the  Khivans 
commenced  about  1830  to  erect  forts  on  the  left  bank 
of  the  Kuvan,  one  of  the  southern  arms  of  the  delta  of 
the  Syr-daria.  In  1846  they  established  there  Fort 
Khoja-Niaz,  which  commanded  the  two  routes  leading 
from  the  Kyzyl- Kum  to  Khiva  and  Bokhara  respec- 
tively, thus  enabling  the  Khivans  to  control  and  exact 
from  the  Kirghese  in  their  migration  to  the  south  of 
the  river,  arid  to  levy  dues  from  caravans  passing  to 
and  from  Orenburg. 

Hence  those  Kazaks  living  south  of  the  Russian 
forts  fell  under  the  exactions  of  Khokand  or  of  Khiva, 
and  the  same  thing  not  infrequently  happened  in  the 
case  of  Kirghese  who  wandered  to  the  Syr  from  the 
north,  where  they  had  submitted  to  and  been  taxed 
by  the  Russians.  Accordingly,  when  the  invaders,  as 
protectors  of  the  Kirghese,  reached  the  Syr-daria,  both 
Khivans  and  Khokandians  commenced  a  series  of  hosti- 
lities, sometimes  against  the  detachments  crossing  the 
Steppe,  and  sometimes  against  the  Kazaks  who  helped 


6i6  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

their  advance.  Besides  this,  caravans  were  pillaged, 
and  violence  of  all  kinds  committed,  so  that  the  home 
Government  deemed  it  necessary,  for  the  protection 
of  the  Kirghese,  who  had  placed  themselves  under 
Russian  rule,  as  well  as  for  the  purpose  of  extending 
her  commercial  intercourse  with  Central  Asia,  to 
occupy  the  upper  course  of  the  Syr-daria.  This 
would  also  help  the  Russians  to  get  in  the  rear  of 
their  turbulent  subjects,  and  surround  them  by  con- 
necting the  contemplated  Syr-daria  line  of  forts  with 
those  pushed  forward  from  the  Irtish. 

Simult-aneously  with  the  building  of  Fort  Raim,  or 
Aralsk,  the  Russians,  as  I  have  observed,  prepared  to 
launch  a  small  fleet  of  steamers  to  dominate  the  Sea  of 
Aral  and  to  advance  up  the  Syr,  thereby  to  strengthen 
the  advance  of  the  troops  to  a  point  where  the  Kara- 
Tau  sinks  into  the  desert,  and  whence  a  line  of 
outposts  might  be  carried  along  the  Chu,  or  the  more 
southerly  Talas,  to  the  valley  of  the  Hi.  In  these 
plans  Russia  professed  to  recognize  no  territorial  en- 
croachment, because  her  Kirghese  subjects  encamped 
on  the  right  bank  of  the  Syr-daria ;  and  the  Chu  had 
been  adopted  as  the  southern  frontier  of  the  Steppe. 

The  Khokandians,  however,  thought  otherwise  ;  and 
when,  in  the  spring  of  1852,  a  survey  corps  approached 
Ak-Mesjed,  they  were  stopped.  Ak-Mesjed,  or  White 
Mosque,  was  the  principal  fort  on  the  Syr-daria,  about 
250  miles  from  the  mouth  of  the  river,  and,  in  native 
estimation,  a  place  of  considerable  strength.  Against 
it  was  sent  a  small  detachment  of  400  men,  who 
with  considerable  bravery  destroyed  and  burnt  the 
outer  works  and  buildings,  reconnoitred  the  district 
thoroughly,  and  as  they  returned  demolished  three 
small    Khokand    forts   lower   down   the   river.       The 


.    THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  TURKISTAN     617 

temper  of  the  enemy  having  thus  been  tested,  a  force 
of  1,500  men  in  the  following  summer  marched  against 
the  place,  commanded  by  General  Perovsky,  a  steamer 
accompanying  up  the  river.  The  fortress  during  the 
interim  had  been  repaired,  and  whilst  preparations 
were  being  made  for  its  capture  by  the  Russians, 
another  70  miles  of  river  bank  were  reconnoitred,  as 
far  as  Fort  Julek,  which  the  garrison  evacuated,  and 
the  Russians  entered  and  destroyed,  before  returning 
to  Ak-Mesjed,  where  the  siege  operations  were  nearly 
complete.  In  August  the  fort  was  taken  by  storm,  and 
called  Perovsky  after  the  name  of  its  captor.  This 
was  in  1853,  before  the  expiration  of  which  year  the 
Khokandians  made  repeated  efforts  to  regain  the  fort, 
but  the  Russians  overcame  them  in  a  battle  under  the 
walls  in  December  and  were  left  in  possession. 

The  invaders  now  proceeded  to  consolidate  their 
position,  and  made  no  important  advances  ibr  eight 
years.  From  1854  to  1858,  which  covered  the  time 
of  the  Crimean  war,  the  Russians  were  doing  little 
more  in  the  Steppe  than  putting  down  various 
Kirghese  insurrections,  especially  that  under  Iset- 
Kutebaroff,  who  threw  the  whole  country  into  disorder 
from  the  Orenburg  line  to  the  Aral,  and  during  this 
time  set  at  defiance  the  efforts  of  the  authorities  to 
expel  or  capture  him.  He  continually  managed  to 
escape  to  the  territory  of  the  Khivans,  who  had  been 
not  uninterested  spectators  to  the  taking  of  Ak-Mesjed, 
and  who  from  their  fort  of  Khoja-Niaz,  which  flanked 
the  Russian  line,  continually  threatened  the  detached 
forts  between  Aralsk  and  Perovsk.  The  General 
deemed  it  necessary,  therefore,  in  1857  to  have  the 
fort  destroyed,  which  was  done  soon  after.  Perovsky 
was  succeeded  by  Katenin,  who,  in  1859,  determined 


6i8  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

to  take  possession  of  Julek  and  fortify  it,  and  thereby 
to  strengthen  Fort  Perovsky.  Accordingly  a  detach- 
ment was  sent  in  1 86 1  for  this  purpose  and  to  demolish 
the  Khokandian  fortification  of  Yany- Kurgan,  some 
60  miles  nearer  Turkistan.  The  buildings  of  the  new 
fort  were  ready  by  October,  and  by  the  end  of  the 
year  the  Russians  had  set  in  order  their  four  forts  on 
the  Syr,  Nos.  i  and  2,  besides  Perovsky  and  Julek  just 
mentioned.  They  had  also  destroyed  Yany-Kurgan, 
and  sent  reconnoitring  parties  to  examine  the  town  of 
Hazret-i-Turkistan,  commonly  called  **  Hazret." 

Russia  had  now  reached  a  spot  whence  it  would 
have  been  easy  to  form  the  long-talked-of  **  natural 
boundary,*'  from  Julek  along  the  Chu  to  the  Almati 
district,  which,  it  will  be  remembered,  had  been  taken 
possession  of  by  the  Siberian  line  in  1854.  South, 
however,  of  the  inhospitable  Chu,  beyond  the  Talas, 
there  was  a  chain  of  forts  that  had  been  constructed 
by  the  Khokandians,  north  of  the  Kara-Tau  and 
Alexandroff  mountains,  to  protect  their  own  frontiers 
from  invasion  from  the  Steppe,  and  to  curb  these 
very  Kirghese,  whom  the  Russians  called  their  own. 
Merke,  Tokmak,  and  Pishpek  had  already  fallen  into  the 
hands  of  the  invaders  from  the  Siberian  side,  and  in  1863 
two  reconnoitring  parties  were  sent  out,  one  from  the 
Orenburg  line  to  Hazret,  the  other  from  the  Siberian  line 
to  Aulie-Ata ;  and  on  the  foundation  of  the  knowledge 
thus  gained,  it  was  determined  to  advance  the  Russian 
frontier  along  the  Khokandian  line,  above  the  towns  of 
Tashkend  and  Hazret.  Colonel  Chernaieff  was  to  ad- 
vance from  Vierny  to  occupy  Aulie-Ata,  whilst  Colonel 
Verefkin  was  to  take  possession  of  the  fortified  places, 
Suzak  and  Chulak-Kurgan — plans  that  in  execution 
were  modified  to  bring  the  boundary  further  south* 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  TURKISTAN.      619 

The  Orenburg  force  of  9,000  troops,  marching 
from  Perovsky  upon  Hazret,  was  opposed  by  a  Kho- 
kandian  force  of  about  16,000,  under  Daulat,  the 
Governor.  Seeing  his  men  were  giving  way  before 
the  fire  of  the  Russians,  he  retreated,  but  could  not 
regain  admittance  to  the  fort,  the  citizens  having 
closed  the  gates  against  him.  Upon  this  the  troops 
dispersed  in  confusion,  and  the  townspeople,  having 
been  gained  over  to  the  Russians,  allowed  these 
**  Kafirs*'  or  **  infidels,"  on  the  12th  July,  1864,  to 
enter  the  holy  town.  The  arms  of  Colonel  Chernaieff 
had  also  been  successful,  Aulie-Ata  having  been 
taken  nine  days  earlier.  The  Khokand  troops  fell 
back  from  Hazret  on  their  next  defensible  position, 
Chimkent,  100  miles  distant.  This  they  fortified  as 
best  they  could,  and  from  hence  they  directed  attacks 
on  the  Russian  outposts.  The  two  detachments  of 
Russian  troops  now  met,  and  united  under  the  single 
command  of  Chernaieff,  who,  it  is  said,  in  repelling 
the  Khokandian  attacks,  was  led  on  in  October  to  the 
town  of  Chimkent  itself,  which  he  took  by  assault  in 
an  hour  with  only  five  men  killed. 

In  this  manner  the  Russians  issued  at  last  from  the 
Steppe  (whither  a  large  proportion  of  their  supplies 
had  to  be  brought  all  the  way  from  the  Orenburg  lines) 
into  an  agricultural  district,  where  they  could  provide 
for  the  troops  from  local  resources,  and  consequently 
concentrate  them  at  will.  The  situation,  however, 
was  not  yet  all  that  could  be  desired.  The  captured 
district  was  overrun  with  robbers,  and  the  Kho- 
kandians  were  collecting  in  force,  besides  which 
winter  was  approaching,  and  a  scarcity  of  provisions 
might  set  in.  Chernaieff,  therefore,  determined  to 
act   with   decision,    and,    while   the   influence   of    his 


620,  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

conquests  was  still  felt,  to  march  to  Tashkend.  On 
the  14th  October  the  troops  stormed  the  town  without 
ladders,  but  were  repulsed,  and  compelled  to  retire  to 
Chimkent.  This  so  emboldened  the  Khokandians 
that  they  marched  out,  10,000  strong,  under  the 
regent  Alim-Kul,  to  attempt  the  re-capture  of  Hazret- 
i-Turkistan.  The  Russian  commandant  of  the  city, 
hearing  of  their  approach,  sent  out  a  sotnia  of  Ural 
Cossacks,  who  were  surrounded  by  the  10,000  natives, 
but  in  vain — the  1 1 8  holding  their  ground,  and  finally 
cutting  their  way  back>  with  the  result  that  Hazret 
was  saved,  and  Alim-Kul  retreated. 

The  conquest  of  Hazret  and  Chimkent  was  so 
plainly  in  excess  of  the  principles  on  which  Russia 
had  all  along  professed  to  be  rectifying  her  frontier 
in  Central  Asia,  and  was  so  likely  to  excite  apprehen- 
sions in  Europe,  that  Prince  Gortschakoff  addressed 
a  circular  letter  **  to  the  legations  and  embassies  of 
the  Russian  Emperor  in  foreign  countries,'*  which  pro- 
fessed to  set  forth  in  its  true  light  the  Asiatic  policy 
of  Russia,  and  ended  by  saying  that  the  expansion 
of  the  Empire  in  Central  Asia  had  now  reached  its 
limit.  The  appearance  of  the  circular  was  followed, 
a  few  months  later,  by  the  constitution  in  February, 
1865,  of  the  old  Syr-daria  line  and  the  newly- 
conquered  region — that  is,  the  territory  from  the  Sea 
of  Aral  to  Issik-Kul,  into  the  Turkistan  oblast,  of 
which  Colonel  Chemaieff,  promoted  to  the  rank  of 
General,  was  appointed  the  first  governor,  subject, 
however,  to  the  Governor-General  of  Orenburg. 

Hostilities  broke  out  again  immediately — in  fact, 
could  hardly  be  said  to  have  been  suspended,  with  a 
new  foe  added  to  Khokand.  I  have  described,  in  an 
earlier  chapter  on  the  history  of  Khokand,  how  its 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  TURKISTAN     621 

borders  were  enlarged  at  the  beginning  of  the  present 
century,  and  have  hinted  that  Bokhara  was  its  here- 
ditary enemy  on  the  west,  watching  for  a  suitable 
opportunity  to  enforce  a  claim  to  the  Khanate.  At 
the  date  of  the  capture  of  Chimkent,  Khudaiar,  it  will 
be  remembered,  had  been  deposed,  and  was  rusticating 
a  second  time  at  Jizakh,  whilst  Alim-Kul  was  acting  as 
regent  in  Tashkend,  with  Seid  Sultan  as  Khan. 

There  was,  however,  a  dissatisfied  party  in  the  town 
who  had  sent  to  Khudaiar  to  return,  by  the  help,  of 
course,  of  the  Bokhariots,  with  whom  he  was  staying, 
and  from  whom  some  of  the  Khokandians  hoped  for 
assistance  against  the  Russians.  Thus  Chernaieff  had 
on  his  frontier  two  armies,  both  of  which  might  be 
supposed  to  be  equally  hostile  to  him,  and  one  of 
them  it  was  feared  might  seize  Tashkend,  if  the 
Russians  did  not  do  so  first.  This  the  Russian  general 
wished  to  do,  and,  hearing  that  the  Bokhariot  troops 
were  assembling  on  the  frontier,  sent  out  a  **  corps 
of  observation "  from  Chimkent  in  the  direction 
of  Tashkend,  which  encamped  in  May  near  Fort 
Niazbeg,  and,  on  being  attacked,  took  it.  On  hearing 
this,  Alim-Kul  made  a  sortie  against  the  Russians, 
and  was  killed,  after  which  a  certain  number  of 
Bokhariots  entered  Tashkend,  and  the  Emir  obtained 
possession  of  the  Khan. 

Meanwhile  Chernaieff  did  not  immediately  follow 
up  his  victory  by  attacking  Tashkend.  There  was  a 
party  within  the  walls  representing  the  mercantile 
community,  who  had  promised  to  open  the  gates  to 
the  Russians  upon  their  storming  the  town,  but  who, 
growing  impatient  of  delay,  sent  a  similar  invitation 
to  the  Bokhariot  army  at  Khojend.  When  the  general 
heard  this,   he  resolved  to  anticipate  the   Bokhariots. 


622  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

and,  after  three  days'  fighting,  Tashkend,  on  the  27th 
May,  was  forced  to  surrender.  Among  the  trophies 
taken  was  a  standard  from  Bokhara,  so  that  Russia 
had  now  crossed  swords,  they  said,  with  a  new  enemy, 
whilst  the  independence  of  the  Khokandians  had  vir- 
tually vanished. 

Mozaffar-ed-din,  the  Emir,  now  became  the  champion 
of  Islam.  Almost  simultaneously  with  the  Russian 
capture  of  Tashkend,  he  had  occupied  Khojend  and 
the  town  of  Khokand,  and  claiming  sovereignty  over 
the  Khanate,  summoned  Chernaiefif  to  evacuate  Tash- 
kend, threatening,  in  case  of  non-compliance,  to  raise 
against  him  a  holy  war.  ChernaiefTs  stern  reply 
astonished  the  Emir,  and  forced  him  to  commence  less 
haughty  negotiations.  As  the  Russian  embassy,  how- 
ever, was  imprisoned,  because  at  ChernaiefTs  recom- 
mendation (according  to  Mr.  R.  Michell)  a  Bokhariot 
embassy  was  detained  at  Kazala,  and  Bokhariot 
merchants  arrested  on  the  Russian  line  and  their 
merchandise  sequestered,  Chernaieff,  in  January,  1866, 
crossed  the  Syr,  and  marched  to  Jizakh  to  obtain  the 
release  of  his  officers.  This  was  promised  him,  after 
which,  being  in  strategical  difficulties,  he  returned  to 
Chinaz  to  learn  that  he  was  superseded  for  exceeding 
his  instructions  by  the  capture  of  Tashkend. 

The  new  General,  Romanovski,  however,  seemed  to 
think  himself  obliged  to  continue  operations  against 
the  Emir  of  Bokhara,  who  had  now  assumed  the 
offensive.  The  imprisoned  officers  had  not  been 
released,  and  consequently,  when  the  Emir  sent  an 
evasive  reply  to  the  repeated  Russian  request,  Roma- 
novski, without  wasting  time,  marched  along  the  left 
bank  of  the  Syr  to  Irjar,  where  the  main  force  of  the 
Bokhariots  was  collected,  and  on  the  8th  of  May  sent 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  TURKISTAN,     623 

them  flying,  a  disordered  rabble,  to  Samarkand.  It  was 
now  a  question  whether  it  were  better  for  the  Russians 
to  pursue  the  fugitives  through  Jizakh  and  occupy 
the  capitals  of  Samarkand  and  Bokhara,  or  move  up  the 
Syr-daria  to  the  forts  of  Nau  and  Khojend.  The 
latter  alternative  was  preferred,  because  the  possession 
of  Khojend  would  enable  the  Russians  to  separate 
Khokand  from  Bokhara,  which,  for  military  purposes, 
was  desirable.  An  advance  was  made,  therefore,  upon 
Nau,  which  surrendered  without  striking  a  blow, 
leaving  the  invaders  to  pursue  their  march  upon 
Khojend,  which,  after  eight  days*  siege,  was  stormed 
at  the  end  of  May.  This  brought  the  Emir  to  his 
senses,  and  the  envoys  were  released. 

For  the  next  few  months  there  was  a  temporary 
cessation  of  hostilities.  It  might  have  been  thought, 
perhaps,  that  the  Russians,  having  now  annexed  a 
large  strip  of  territory  in  the  Syr-daria  valley,  over 
which  the  Emir  had  claims,  and  having  avenged 
ChernaiefTs  retreat,  as  well  as  obtained  the  release 
of  the  envoys,  might  well  have  rested  satisfied  with 
their  success.  In  the  following  September,  however, 
the  Governor-General  of  Orenburg  visiting  Turkistan 
deemed  it  desirable  to  resume  military  operations  in 
order  to  occupy  the  Bokhariot  forts  of  Ura-Tiube  and 
Jizakh,  situated  at  passes  in  the  southern  Khokand 
range,  and  so  deprive  the  Emir  of  his  standing  in  the 
Syr-daria  valley.  The  Governor-General  took  per- 
sonal part  in  the  expedition,  and  on  October  2nd  Ura- 
Tiube  was  occupied,  and  also  Jizakh  a  fortnight  after- 
wards. There  still  remained  one  point  it  was  important 
to  possess,  because,  from  its  situation  in  front  of 
Jizakh,  it  commanded  its  waters,  and  completely 
enabled  the   Bokhariots,   in  the  event  of  a  siege,  to 


624  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

place  the  garrison  in  a  critical  situation.  This  was 
Fort  Yani-Kurgan,  which,  in  the  spring  of  1867,  the 
Russians  proceeded  to  occupy.  The  Emir  was  now- 
glad  to  sue  for  peace.  Negotiations,  with  that  object 
in  view,  had  been  commenced  at  the  end  of  1866, 
but  a  treaty  was  not  finally  ratified,  as  will  presently 
be  seen,  without  another  appeal  to  arms. 

So  extensive  had  the  Russian  conquests  now  become 
that  a  new  form  of  administration  seemed  desirable. 
To  accomplish  this  plan  the  Ala-Tau  district  was 
enlarged  into  the  Semirechia  oblast,  which,  added  to 
the  recently-formed  military  district  of  Turkistan 
and  the  newly-taken  possessions  south  of  Chimkent, 
was  to  be  cut  off  from  Orenburg  and  to  constitute 
the  general  government  of  Turkistan,  Adjutant- 
General  von  Kaufmann  being  entrusted  not  only 
with  the  ordinary  powers  of  a  Governor-General,  but 
with  plenipotentiary  authority  in  political  matters,  to 
negotiate  and  conclude  treaties  with  all  the  independent 
rulers  of  Central  Asia.  The  new  Governor-General 
arrived  at  Tashkend  on  the  19th  November,  1867. 
At  that  date  negotiations  for  peace  were  still  proceed- 
ing with  the  Emir,  who  seemed  so  little  to  like  the 
terms  proposed  by  the  Russians,  that  he  delayed 
signing  the  treaty,  and  thereby  gained  time  for  further 
preparations  for  war. 

Meanwhile  irresponsible  bands  of  Bokhariots  attacked 
or  pillaged  the  Russian  frontier.  In  March,  1868, 
500  Cossacks  were  despatched  for  the  purpose  of 
securing  quiet,  and  also  to  choose  a  site  near  Samar- 
kand for  the  erection  of  a  Russian  fortress,  as  pro- 
posed by  the  terms  of  the  treaty,  but  which  the  Emir 
had  not  ratified.  Inasmuch,  however,  as  this  fort  would 
be  a  direct  menace  to  both  Samarkand  and  Bokhara,  it 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  TURKISTAN     625 

is  little  matter  for  surprise  that  the  progress  of  the 
Cossacks  was  opposed  at  Uchum.  The  Bokhariots  were 
put  to  flight,  of  course,  and  as  the  Emir  still  delayed  to 
sign  the  treaty,  and  proclaimed  a  holy  war,  the  Russian 
troops  marched  to  Samarkand,  and  on  the  ist  of  May 
captured  it  without  a  shot.  To  secure  themselves  in 
this  position,  which,  by  reason  of  its  controlling  the 
waters  of  Bokhara,  brought  that  city  entirely  under 
their  power,  the  next  move  of  the  Russians  was  to 
occupy  the  strong  fortress  of  Katte- Kurgan,  on  the 
road  to  Bokhara,  and  this  was  done  on  May  30th, 
though  there  continued  for  some  days  incessant  fighting 
and  skirmishing.  The  Emir  then  determined  to  make 
a  last  stand  at  Zerbulak,  near  Katte-Kurgan,  whither 
von  Kaufmann  hastened  to  meet  him,  completely, 
routed  him  on  the  14th  July,  1868,  and  then  turned 
back  in  time  to  relieve  Samarkand,  which,  in  his 
absence,  had  been  attacked  by  a  force  of  50,090 
men. 

After  these  defeats  the  Emir  was  obliged  to  submit 
to  the  R'ussian  conditions  of  peace ;  but  his  troubles 
were  not  at  an  end,  nor  did  the  Russians  sheath  their 
swords,  for  the  eldest  son  of  the  Emir  and  the  Beks  of 
Shahr-i-sabz  raised  revolt  and  seized  Karshi,  whereupon 
the  Emir  asked  the  Russians  to  interfere.  Accordingly 
General  Abramoff  marched  against  Karshi  and  cap- 
tured it,  the  rebels  fleeing  for  a  time  to  Shahr-i-sabz, 
whence  they  were  dislodged  in  August,  1870.  After 
this  the  Russians,  not  wishing  to  encroach  further  on 
Bokhariot  territory,  and,  greatly  to  the  surprise  of  the 
Emir,  invited  him  to  take  over  the  management  of 
that  part  of  his  country  they  had  rescued  from  the 
rebels,  and  he  was  allowed  to  retain  his  crippled 
independence.     Thus  Bokhara  was  subdued  as  Kho-

kand  had  been,  the  sovereign  being  left  in  either  case 
to  the  principal  part  of  his  possessions. 

The  scene  of  Russian  annexation  was  now  transferred 
to  the  Hi.  In  the  year  1862  rebellion  had  broken  out 
in  Sungaria  and  spread  to  the  Hi  valley,  where  in  1864 
the  Dungans  and  Taranchis  united  to  throw  off  the 
Chinese  yoke.  The  results  of  the  insurrection,  so  far 
as  Russia  was  concerned,  were  the  destruction  of  their 
consulates  and  factories  in  Kuldja  and  Chuguchak,  the 
entire  cessation  of  commerce,  an  influx  of  ruined  and 
plundered  emigrants  into  Semirechia,  and  perpetual 
disturbances  on  the  frontier.  In  keeping,  however, 
with  existing  treaties,  Russia  declined  to  interfere  or 
to  lend  help  to  the  Chinese  generals,  who  in  1866 
were  completely  beaten.  The  rebels  next  quarrelled 
with  each  other  for  supreme  power,  and  in  the 
following  year  occurred  a  wholesale  slaughter  of  the 
Dungans,  the  Taranchis  being  left  to  rule.  The  same 
policy  of  non-intervention  was  continued  for  a  time 
towards  the  new  government,  the  number  of  refugees 
increasing,  and  petty  quarrels  caused  by  the  raids  and 
robberies  of  the  nomads  rendered  the  defence  of  the 
frontier  more  and  more  difficult.  Nor  did  it  become 
easier  to  keep  the  peace  after  the  arrival  of  von 
Kaufmann,  for  when  in  May,  1870,  the  Taranchis, 
who  guarded  the  Muzart  Pass,  had  attacked  five 
Russian  Kirghese,  the  Governor-General  directed 
the  Pass  to  be  occupied,  much  to  the  dislike  of  the 
Taranchis,  because  it  was  the  only  passage  in  the 
Thian  Shan  range  that  united  the  Hi  and  Altishahr 
provinces.  The  movement,  however,  was  thought  to 
be  desirable  just  then,  because  it  was  feared  that 
Yakoob  Beg,  pursuing  his  conquests  in  Kashgar, 
might  attempt  to  come  by  that  way  to  occupy  Kuldja 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  TURKISTAN     627 

where  the  Kashgarians,  says  Terentieff,  could  not  be 
tolerated,  otherwise  increased  difficulties  might  be 
expected,  since  the  proximity  of  even  the  Taranchis 
had  obliged  the  Russians  to  maintain  three  detach- 
ments of  troops  on  the  frontier. 

The  Taranchi  sultan,  however,  insisted  upon  the 
recall  of  the  Thian  Shan  detachment,  aitd  threatened, 
in  case  of  refusal,  to  have  recourse  to  arms.  Matters 
being  thus  brought  to  a  head,  a  report  was  sent  to 
Petersburg  suggesting  that  Kuldja  should  be  annexed, 
and  asking  permission  for  a  movement.  Forces  at 
Borokhudzir  were  strengthened,  to  be  commanded  by 
General  Kolpakovsky  in  the  spring  of  1871,  and 
reconnoitring  detachments  sent  out.  One  of  these 
detachments  was  attacked  by  the  Taranchis,  and  thus 
open  hostilities  commenced.  But  the  campaign  was 
over  in  a  fortnight.  The  troops  left  Borokhudzir  on 
June  24th,  and  four  days  later  defeated  4,000  of  the 
enemy  at  Alim-Tu.  On  the  30th  the  Russians  con- 
quered Chinchakhodzi  after  a  fight,  and  on  the  next 
day,  without  opposition,  occupied  Suidun.  On  July 
3rd  the  sultan  surrendered  himself  a  captive  of  war, 
and  on  the  morrow  General  Kolpakovsky  entered 
Kuldja. 

This  occupation  of  the  Hi  province  was  treated  as  a 
purely  temporary  affair,  and  the  Russian  Government 
at  once  assured  the  Court  of  Peking  that  it  was  their 
intention  to  take  over  the  administration  of  the  country 
until  such  time  merely  as  the  Chinese  were  strong 
enough  to  resume  possession.  That  time,  as  some  of 
the  Russian  officers  told  me,  they  thought  would 
never  come ;  but,  as  we  shall  presently  see,  it  did, 
for  Chinese  troops  were  despatched  westwards  under 
a  military  governor,   Tsin-Tsiang  Tsiun,  who    estab- 


628  RUSSIAN  CENTAL  ASIA. 

lished  himself  at  Chuguchak,  with  a  view  to  regaining 
the  revolted  territory  in  the  west  of  the  Empire. 

This  occupation  of  Kuldja  preceded  almost  im- 
mediately another  expedition  that  had  long  been 
meditated,  against  Khiva ;  the  reasons  for  it  being 
continuous  robberies  by  the  Khivans,  their  collection 
of  taxes  from  Russian  Kirghese,  their  incitement  of 
the  Kazaks  to  revolt,  and  the  capture  and  enslaving 
of  Russian  subjects  during  the  course  of  many  years. 
More  than  one  attempt  had  been  made  to  chastise 
the  Khanate,  but  each  expedition  had  failed  through 
treachery  or  the  difficulty  of  approach.  When  von 
Kaufmann  arrived  at  Tashkend  in  1867,  he  wrote 
to  the  Khivan  Khan,  informing  him  of  the  plenipo- 
tentiary authority  entrusted  to  him,  and  that  a  Russian 
detachment  had  been  sent  beyond  the  Syr-daria  to 
punish  marauders  who  pillaged  caravans.  This  com- 
munication elicited  only  a  delayed  and  haughty  reply 
from  the  Khivans,  who  were  puffed  up  at  the  weaken- 
ing of  Bokhariot  power,  and,  surrounded  by  the  desert, 
fancied  themselves  secure.  They  continued  their 
former  practices,  and  further  letters  of  remonstrance 
from  the  Governor-General  were  either  unanswered, 
or  answered  insolently,  until  in  1870  von  Kaufmann 
reported  to  Petersburg  the  necessity  of  an  appeal 
to  arms,  for  which  permission  was  given.  Accord- 
ingly, during  the  summers  of  1871  and  1872,  the 
part  of  the  Kyzyl- Kum  lying  to  the  north  of  Bokhara 
was  surveyed,  and  small  detachments  were  sent  from 
Kazalinsk  to  investigate  the  country  on  the  way  to 
Khiva.  Besides  this,  detachments  were  sent  to  ex- 
plore the  country  south  of  the  Emba,  and  others  to 
investigate  the  old  bed  of  the  Oxus. 

When  all   was   in   readiness,   the  forces   placed  at 


THE  RUSSIAN  OCCUPATION  OF  TURKISTAN.     629 

the  disposal  of  General  von  Kaufmann  for  the  Khiva 
expedition  started  from  three  bases  of  operation — 
from  the  Turkistan  district,  from  the  Orenburg  district, 
and  from  the  Caspian.  The  result  showed  that  the 
column  from  Orenburg  would  have  been  ample  for 
the  taking  of  Khiva,  for  the  Khan  made  the  poorest 
resistance,  and  ran  away.  He  was  recalled,  and 
nominally  placed  in  his  former  position,  but  with  a 
fine  imposed  that  he  would  require  twenty  years  to 
pay.  Moreover,  the  delta  and  right  bank  of  the  Oxus 
was  taken  by  Russia ;  the  Oxus  closed  to  all  vessels 
except  Russian  and  Khivan,  and  a  Russian  fortress 
built  at  Petro-Alexandrovsk. 

Thus  was  humbled  the  last  of  the  three  Khanates, 
a  considerable  slice  having  been  cut  off  from  each 
wherewith  to  increase  the  general  government  of 
Turkistan.  The  next  accretion  was  made  three  years 
later,  in  1876,  by  adding  the  remainder  of  the  Khanate 
of  Khokand.  The  general  government  had  now  attained 
in  size  to  one-twentieth  part  of  the  Russian  Empire, 
and  so  remained  until  the  death  of  von  Kaufmann. 
Subsequently  this  enormous  territory  was  divided,  in 
1882,  into  two  general  governments,  with  the  first 
heads  of  which  I  was  brought  in  contact  at  the  time 
of  my  visit,  whilst  in  the  following  year,  the  Hi 
province  was  ceded  back  to  the  Chinese,  thereby 
bringing  what  I  have  called  Russian  Central  Asia 
(apart  from  Turkmenia)  to  its  present  proportions. 


CHAPTER   XLII. 

DO    WE  KNOW  THE  TRUTH  ABOUT 
SIBERIAN  PRISONS?     ' 

Different  estimates  of  **  Through  Siberia.** — Doubts  of  sceptical 
friends. — Prisons  supposed  to  have  been  prepared  for  my  visits. — 
The  supposition  examined. — Opinions  of  residents  in  Russia  and 
Siberia. — Testimony  of  a  Swede. — Examination  of  statements  con- 
cerning Siberian  Prisons  in  ''Called  Back.** — Prince  Krapotkine's 
censure,  and  its  value. — ^The  class  of  facts  borne  witness  to  in 
"Through  Siberia.** 

WHEN  I  returned  from  my  long  journey  across 
Northern  Asia  I  gave  to  the  world  *'  an 
unprejudiced  statement  of  what  I  saw  and  heard  in 
the  prisons  and  mines  of  Siberia."  One  Russian 
prison  inspector,  of  high  standing,  volunteered  the 
remark  that  what  I  had  said  was  so  perfectly  correct 
that  my  book  might  be  taken  as  a  standard  even  by 
Russian  authorities  ;  but  another  Russian  writer  has 
allowed  himself  to  go  so  far  as  to  say  that  my  book — 
**  in  so  far  at  least  as  it  is  concerned  with  gaols  and 
convicts — can  only  convey  false  ideas."  The  worth 
of  this  latter  criticism  may  to  some  extent  be  gauged 
by  the  fact  that,  although  "  Through  Siberia "  has 
been  translated  into  three  languages,  and  has  been 
honoured  with  more  than  200  literary  notices  and 
reviews,  yet  no  such  misstatement  has  been  pointed  out 


SIBERIAN  PRISONS.  631 

as  to  make  it  necessary  in  an/  one  of  four  subsequent 
editions  to  alter  what  had  been  printed  at  first.  I  say 
this,  not  boastfully,  still  less  defiantly,  but  as  affording 
some  sort  of  proof  that  I  did  not  write  at  random. 

But  I  am  not  so  sanguine  as  to  suppose  that  all  are, 
or  are  likely  to  be,  convinced.  Even  among  my  friends 
there  are  those  who  think  I  did  not  see  things  in  their 
normal  condition.  This  suspicion  was  pleasantly 
hinted,  before  my  book  appeared,  by  the  late  Dean 
Close,  who,  writing  to  me  on  another  subject,  play- 
fully added,  "  I  suppose  those  letters  in  the  Times 
were  yours.  ...  I  should  very  much  doubt  whether 
those  cunning  Russians  have  not  deceived  you.  They 
knew  what  they  were  about  when  they  gave  you 
apparent  liberty  of  access  to  all  their  prisons.  Do  you 
suppose,  if  there  were  any  horrors,  they  would  show 
them  to  you  "i  No.  They  saw  in  a  moment  that,  if 
they  could  apparently  open  all  Siberia  to  you,  they 
would  get  what  they  have  got, — a  w^hitewashing  in 
the  Times !  I  am  not  a  violent  Anti-Russ ;  but  I 
don't  believe  that  they  would  show  to  any  Englishman 
all  their  heavy  irons  in  Siberia." 

Others  have  said,  **Do  you  not  think  that  the 
prisons  were  prepared  for  your  inspection  ?"  And 
this  question  was  answered  in  the  affirmative  by  the 
St,  James  s  Gazette,  on  the  authority  of  **a  Russian 
informant,''  stating  that  *'  official  orders  were  sent  before 
me  to  the  prisons  to  make  things  wear  a  favourable 
aspect  for  my  visit.*'  Upon  seeing  this  I  wrote  to  the 
editor  **that  if  his  Russian  informant,  or  any  other, 
thinks  that  I  have  been  duped  or  misinformed,  I  am 
perfectly  ready  to  be  questioned,  and  shall  be  happy 
to  discuss  the  question  in  the  public  press,  provided 
only  that  my  opponent  give  facts,  dates,  names,  and 


632  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

places,  and  do  not  hide  behind  general  statements 
and  impersonalities."  This  rejoinder  the  editor  did 
not  publish,  and  I  therefore  inserted  the  challenge 
in  the  second,  third,  fourth,  and  fifth  editions  of 
**  Through  Siberia,"  but  no  one  has  taken  up  the 
challenge. 

Let  us  suppose,  however,  for  a  moment,  that  official 
orders  were  sent  on  before  me  to  make  things  wear  a 
favourable  aspect :  then  how  far  could  this  in  all  cases 
have  been  carried  out,  and  to  what  extent  ?  I  told 
the  authorities  in  Petersburg,  in  May,  that  I  was  going 
to  Tiumen,  Tomsk,  Irkutsk,  and  Kiakhta,  whence  I 
purposed  to  retrace  my  steps.  In  keeping  with  this, 
they  certainly  could  have  telegraphed  that  I  was 
coming,  but  as  to  when  I  presume  they  would  be  at  a 
loss  to  say,  for  I  did  not  know  myself.  I  reached 
Tiumen  in  1 7  days,  and  can  only  say  that,  if  the  prison 
authorities  there  had  received  orders  to  make  things 
wear  a  favourable  aspect,  they  had  not  efficiently  carried 
them  out.  But  the  next  place,  Tobolsk,  is  more  to 
my  purpose.  .  I  had  not  decided  to  go  there  at  all,  and 
even  if  the  Governor  had  known  generally  of  my 
coming,  he  could  not  have  been  expecting  me  on  the 
morning  of  June  2nd,  when  the  floods  were  out,  and 
necessitated  our  driving  through  water  up  to  the  axles. 
In  fact,  the  post-road  was  at  this  moment  supposed  to 
be  impassable  ;  the  Governor  himself  was  waiting,  with 
packed  trunks,  to  accomplish  by  steamer  the  reverse 
journey  we  had  done  by  road,  and  one  of  his  first 
questions  was,  **  How  in  the  world  did  you  get 
here  ? "  We  asked  to  see  the  prisons  at  once.  The 
police-master  was  sent  for,  and  in  a  few  minutes  we 
hurried  off  in  vehicles  to  the  prisons.  In  this  case, 
then,  where  was  time  to  make  things  wear  a  favourable 


SIBERIAN  PRISONS.  633 

aspect  ?  Next,  at  Tomsk,  finding  I  had  to  wait  a 
week,  we  took  a  run  of  230  miles  to  Barnaul,  entirely 
off  our  road,  and  not  down  in  my  programme.  We 
arrived  in  the  night,  and  next  day  stirred  up  the 
police-master  before  he  knew,  I  suspect,  of  our  exist- 
ence. A  third  variation  from  my  pre-announced  plans 
was  the  visit  to  the  Alexandrevsky  Prison,  near  Irkutsk, 
to  which  town  I  thought  to  go  and  thence  drive  out ; 
but  we  cut  across  country  instead,  and  reached  the 
prison  at  dusk.  Here  they  could  hardly  have  ex- 
pected me,  for  the  Vice-Governor  wanted  to  tele- 
graph to  the  capital  for  permission  to  show  us  the 
prison,  but  could  not  do  so  because  in  the  fire  at 
Irkutsk  the  telegraph  lines  were  broken.  Yet  here  I 
entered  early  in  the  morning,  and  went  wherever  and 
saw  whatever  I  asked.  But,  further,  supposing  for  the 
sake  of  argument  that  all  had  been  prepared  from 
Petersburg  up  to  this  point,  I  now  altered  my  plans 
for  the  fourth  time,  in  this  case  radically,  and,  instead 
of  retracing  my  steps,  went  on  to  the  Amur,  through 
the  very  heart  of  the  convict  country.  At  Chita  the 
supposed  expectation  of  my  coming  did  not  by  any 
appearances  betray  itself.  At  Kara,  indeed,  my 
coming  was  heralded  by  telegraph ;  but  on  reaching 
Khabarofka,  had  I  been  a  hunted  hare  I  could  not 
have  more  completely  doubled  upon  my  pursuers,  for, 
whereas  my  papers  set  out  that  I  was  going  600  miles 
south  to  Vladivostock,  the  steamer  having  left,  I 
elected  straightway  to  go  600  miles  north  to 
Nikolaefsk,  and  on  my  arrival  I  next  morning  pre- 
sented myself  to  the  prison  officials. 

If,  then,  after  detailing  these  five  changes  of  plan, 
the  reader  still  thinks  that  the  Russian  authorities 
managed  to  keep  ahead  of  me  with  their  messages  and 


634  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

telegrams  during  my  five  months*  journey  over  8,000 
miles,  then  I  must  acknowledge  that  he  has  a  belief 
in  the  foresight  and  consummate  watchfulness  of 
Siberian  officials  such  as  I  do  not  possess ;  and  I 
would  ask  next,  What  were  the.  things  the  Russians 
did  not  permit  me  to  see  ?  or.  What  were  the  steps 
they  took  to  "  make  things  wear  a  favourable  aspect "  ? 
because,  until  the  aforesaid  **  Russian  informant," 
or  some  other,  can  back  up  his  assertions  or  suspicions 
by  something  like  proof,  the  answer  I  must  give  to 
my  friends  is  this  :  In  certain  instances,  as  at  Kansk, 
Irkutsk,  Kara,  and  Vladivostock — where  my  visit  was 
definitely  expected  some  hours  previously — things  may 
have  been  made  to  wear  a  holiday  aspect,  so  far  as 
rooms  being  brushed  out  and  dust  removed,  with  an 
extra  wash  and  so  forth  ;  but  in  many  cases,  notably 
at  Tiumen,  Tobolsk,  Tomsk,  Barnaul,  Krasnoiarsk, 
Chita,  and  Nikolaefsk,  there  was  not  time  between  my 
arrival  at  the  town,  or  the  presentation  of  my  cre- 
dentials and  the  moment  of  my  admittance  to  the 
prisons,  to  allow  even  for  this ;  and  in  no  case  could  I 
honestly  say  that  I  have  reason  to  suspect  things  were 
made  to  simulate  for  me  a  deceitful  appearance. 

But  what  do  my  friends  say  who  live  in  Russia  and 
Siberia  ?  I  must  not  withhold  the  fact  that  two  of 
them  share  the  suspicions  or  prejudices  of  friends 
in  England.  The  first  says :  '*  I  read  the  book 
(*  Through  Siberia ')  with  great  interest,  and  must 
acknowledge  that  I  found  one  fault ;  that  is,  I  think 
you  give  the  Russians  too  much  credit."  The  second 
is  my  old  host.  Captain  de  Vries,  who  has  now  passed 
away,  but  a  correspondent  wrote  to  me  :  "  During  one 
of  my  last  visits  the  Captain  informed  me  that  though 
h^  considered    your   work    *  Through    Siberia '    well 


SIBERIAN  PRISONS.  635 

written,  and  a  correct  statement  of  what  you  really 
saw  and  heard,  yet  he  could  not  rid  himself  of  the 
impression  that  you  did  not  see  matters  in  their  every- 
day aspect ;  but  that,  notwithstanding  your  avowal  in 
the  preface  to  the  contrary,  the  officials  were  informed 
beforehand  of  your  visit,  and  consequently  prepared 
for  your  reception." 

Another  correspondent,  however,  in  Siberia  speaks 
differently;  and  a  Swede  living  in  Russia  says:  "I 
have  read  your  *  Through  Siberia  *  with  deep  interest, 
and  can  only  say  that  I  never  read  anything  so  fair  and 
impartial  printed  in  the  English  language  relating  to 
matters  in  Russia.  Ever  since  the  Crimean  War,  I 
have  seen  matters  relating  to  Russia  grossly  mis- 
represented in  the  English  press  and  in  English 
books,  and  always  felt  sorry ;  for  surely  it  is  not 
creditable  to  a  great  nation  (to  say  the  least)  to 
deviate  from  the  plain  truth  in  speaking  about  others. 
As  far  as  my  own  experience  goes,  there  may  be 
many  things  said  respecting  a  wide  field  for  improve- 
ment here,  but  from  general  experience  I  can  testify 
that  I  always  have  seen  prisoners  in  Russia  treated 
with  much  kindness  by  officials  as  well  as  the  public 
at  large.  At  the  lime  of  the  last  rising  in  Poland  in 
1862-3-4,  I  served  as  locomotive  superintendent  on 
Moscow-Nijny  railway.  As  may  be  supposed,  feeling 
ran  high,  but  I  never  saw  a  single  act  of  unkindness 
against  any  of  the  Polish  prisoners,  who  were  carried 
on  the  Nijny  railway  in  large  numbers  at  the  time  in 
question.  Nor  have  I  ever  since  seen  any  prisoner 
treated  anything  but  well — sometimes  even,  according 
to  my  notion,  too  well ;  that  is  to  say,  the  prisoner  has 
got  less  work,  more  food,  more  clothing,  and  better 
lodgings,  than  many  a  free  man  can  get  by  his  labour. 


636  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

and  often  enough  the  prisoner  has  experienced  more 
kindness  at  the  hands  of  prison  officials,  than  the  free 
man  from  his  employers."  These  testimonies,  then, 
wholly  unsought  by  me,  I  leave  to  speak  for  them- 
selves. 

Besides  the  suspicions  of  friends,  however,  I  have 
been  confronted  with  the  Siberian  chapter  in  the 
story  of"  Called  Back,"  by  "  Hugh  Conway,"  and  have 
been  asked  how  that  tallies  with  my  account.  Here- 
upon I  would  first  inquire.  Is  the  story  fiction  or 
fact  ?  As  fiction,  I  have  little  to  say  to  the  novel, 
except  that  the  author  has  not  learned  his  lesson 
perfectly.     When,  however,  he  says,  '*  I  expect  to  be 

believed All  else  save  this  one  thing  I  could 

prove  to  be  true,"  does  the  author  wish  his  readers  to 
understand  that  he  really  went  to  Siberia  and  saw  the 
facts  he  records }  If  so,  then  I  detect  in  **  Called 
Back  "  another  of  the  series  of  apocryphal  books  on 
that  much-abused  country,  and  can  only  regret  that 
the  popular  tale  will  **  carry  the  lie  round  the  world, 
while  Truth  js  putting  on  her  boots."  Still,  I  have 
no  intention  of  charging  the  author  with  deliberate 
misrepresentation.  He  dipped  his  brush  in  colours 
which  I  can  well  conceive  he  thought  might  be  true, 
and  I  fail  to  see  in  him  the  animus  which  certain 
Russian  writers  betray.* 

•  Will  the  reader  be  good  enough  to  judge  the  grounds  of  my 
adverse  judgment  ?  The  hero  of  "  Called  Back ' '  goes  to  Siberia  in  search 
of  a  prisoner,  and  on  arriving  at  Petersburg  he  says :  "  We  received  a 
passport  authorizing  me  to  travel  to  the  end  of  the  Czar's  Asiatic 
dominions  if  I  thought  fit,  which  was  worded  in  such  a  way  that  it 
obviated  the  necessity  of  obtaining  a  fresh  passport  wherever  a  fresh 
government  district  was  to  be  traversed.'*  Again,  "All  convicts  were 
first  sent  to  Tobolsk.  .  .  .  whence  they  were  drafted  off  at  the  pleasure 
of  the  Governor-General  to  various  places.  ...  If  I  wished,  the 
Governor  of  Tobolsk  should  be  telegraphed  to ;  but  as  I  was  bound 


SIBERIAN  PRISONS.  637 

I  now  proceed  to  the  articles  of  Prince  Krapotkine,* 
who  permitted  himself  to  say  that,  concerning  gaols 
and  convicts,  **  Through  Siberia "  could  only  con- 
vey false  ideas  ;  .  and  whose  testimony  has  been  set 
against  mine.  How,  then,  stands  the  matter  ?  Prince 
Krapotkine  gets  his  information  from  three  sources, 

any  way  to  go  to  that  town,  it  would  be  just  as  well  if  I  made  my 
inquiries  in  person  *';  and  it  was  at  Tobolsk  the  author  expected  to 
"  await  the  pleasure  of  the  Governor- General."  Now  here  is  a  small 
pickle  of  mistakes  to  begin  with !  For,  a  passport  does  not  entitle 
the  holder  to  travel  by  post,  but  a  podorojna^  which  gives  a  claim 
to  horses  between  two  points ;  but  it  is  immaterial  whether,  in  reach- 
ing one's  destination,  the  traveller  passes  through  one  government 
or  half-a-dozen.  Next,  all  convicts  are  not  distributed  from  Tobolsk, 
but  from  Tinmen.  It  is  here  the  author  should  have  gone  to  make 
his  imaginary  inquiries,  and  then  he  would  not  have  been  **  bound 
any  way  to  go  to  Tobolsk,"  but  could  have  driven  direct  to  Tomsk. 
Besides  this,  the  Governor- General  did  not  live  at  Tobolsk,  but  700 
miles  distant  at  Omsk  !  Next,  our  author's  geography  is  somewhat 
faulty,  as  is  his  knowledge  of  posting  customs.  He  says  :  '*  A  trifle 
of  some  400  miles  from  Ekaterineburg  to  Tinmen"  (this  should  be 
204),  and  **at  the  east  bank  of  the  Irtish,  Siberia  proper  begins'* 
(this  is  wrong  by  150  miles).  Then  he  speeds  on  so  fast  that  he  "  left  the 
yemstchik  no  time  for  refreshment."  But  why  should  he?  Does  he 
think  that  the  yemstchik,  like  an  interpreter,  accompanies  one  all  the 
way,  or  has  he  to  leam  that  he  merely  drives  the  traveller  to  the 
next  station,  perhaps  an  hour's  run,  and  then  goes  back  with  his 
horses?  But  a  sentence  most  damaging  to  ** Called  Back"  as  an 
authority  on  Siberian  affairs  is  this  :  **  We  passed  many  gangs  of  con- 
victs plodding  along  to  their  fate.  Ivan  told  me  that  most  of  them 
were  in  chains.  This  I  should  not  have  noticed,  as  the  irons  are  only 
on  the  legs  and  worn  under  the  trousers."  Now,  I  have  seen  scores, 
not  to  say  hundreds,  of  Russian  leg-chains,  and  I  have  a  pair,  with  a 
prison  suit,  in  my  own  possession.  I  put  them  on  and  was  photo- 
graphed, and  the  illustration  in  '*  Through  Siberia,"  p.  155,  of  "  Convict 
Summer  Clothing  and  Chains,"  represents  "your  humble  servant" 
in  all  but  the  features.  From  this  picture  it  will  be  seen  that  the 
chain,  30  inches  long,  fastened  to  each  ankle,  could  not  be  worn 
under  the  trousers.  Yet  our  humane  author  adds,  "  Poor  wretched 
beings,  my  heart  ached  for  them !"  And  so,  doubtless,  has  that  of 
many  of  his  readers — especially  ladies — but  quite  needlessly,  for  these 
chains  worn  under  the  trousers  are  but  a  hoax. 
*  I  am  indebted  for  information  concerning  Prince  Krapotkine  to

and  so  do  I :  from  what  he  sees,  what  he  hears,  and 
what  he  reads.     As  regards  the  last,  I  at  once  yield  ! 

to  him,  as  better  able  to  inform  the  public  than  I, 
since  he  writes  of  his  own  country,  and  from  books 
in  his  own  language.  When,  however,  we  come  to 
testimony  from  seeing  and  hearing,  things  are  not 
quite  the  same.  My  critic,  as  far  as  I  understand,  has 
seen  the  inside  of  two  prisons  in  Petersburg.  I  have 
seen  more  than  twenty  times  two,  all  over  the  Empire  ; 
and  although,  if  I  had  as  a  visitor  seen  ten  times  this 

**  Stepniak,'*  a  fonner  editor  of  a  Russian  revolutionary  paper,  who, 
in  "  Underground  Russia,"  gives  a  slight  sketch  of  "Peter  Krapotkine,* ' 
to  the  effect  that,  having  been  educated  at  the  College  of  the  Pages, 
he  went,  in  1861,  to  Siberia  to  study  its  geology.  (I  have  seen  two 
pamphlets,  which  I  presume  to  be  the  outcome  of  that  journey.)  Ten 
years  later  he  travelled  in  Belgium  and  Switzerland,  and  (says  *'  Step- 
niak**) ''became  an  internationalist,  and  adopted  the  ideas  of  the 
most  extreme  party,  the  so-called  anarchical  party,  of  which  he  has 
always  remained  a  fervent  champion.**  In  1872  he  was  admitted  to 
the  Russian  revolutionary  circle,  and  **  entrusted  with  the  duty  of  draw- 
ing up  the  programme  of  the  party  and  its  organization,  which  was 
afterwards  found  among  his  papers.**  In  the  winter  of  1872  he  com- 
menced his  secret  lectures,  was  caught,  and  confined  for  three  years 
in  the  fortress  prison.  Then  he  was  removed,  according  to  his  own 
account,  for  three  months  to  the  "  House  of  Detention  at  Petersburg  '* 
before  his  transfer  to  the  military  hospital.  In  a  few  months  (says 
"  Stepniak  **)  his  health  was  re-established,  but  he  did  everything  in  his 
power  to  hide  the  fact.  He  induced  those  in  charge  of  him  always  to 
believe  him  to  be  in  extremis^  etc.  (p.  162).  He  walked  with  the  step  of 
a  dying  man  :  he  spoke  in  a  low  voice,  as  if  merely  to  open  the  mouth 
were  a  painful  effort.  The  doctor  ordered  him  frequent  exercise  ;  when 
one  fine  day  in  July,  the  gates  of  the  yard  being  open  for  laying  in 
wood,  he  suddenly  takes  to  his  heels,  leaps  into  a  carriage  prepared  by 
his  friends,  and  leaves  behind  the  sentinel,  and  the  officer  tearing  his 
hair  and  exclaiming  that  he  is  ruined.  Thus  much  from  "  Stepniak  "  ; 
except  that  he  says,  '*  Peter  Krapotkine  is  one  of  the  most  sincere  and 
frank  of  men :  he  always  says  the  truth  pure  and  simple,  without  any 
regard  for  the  amour  ^of  re  of  his  hearers,  or  for  any  consideration 
whatever.  This  is  the  most  striking  and  sympathetic  feature  of  his 
character.  Every  word  he  says  may  be  absolutely  believed.  .  .  . 
This  absolute  sincerity  renders  him  the  best  of  friends,  and  gives 
especial  weight  to  his  praise  or  blame.''

number,  it  would  not  make  my  testimony  upon  certain 
things  so  valuable  as  his,  yet  upon  some  things  it 
ought  to  be  a  great  deal  better.  It  stands  to  reason 
that,  upon  such  matters  as  the  conduct  of  the  turnkeys 
towards  prisoners,  and  the  various  details  of  prison 
life  and  discipline  that  do  not  meet  a  visitor  s  eye, 
my  testimony  is  as  nothing  compared  with  that  of 
a  prisoner,  and  I  willingly  yield  precedence  to  my 
critic.  But  *'one  need  not  eat  a  whole  leg  of  mutton 
to  know  how  it  tastes,"  and  one  need  not  be  in  a 
prison  a  month  to  know  whether  the  rooms  are  large 
or  small,  crowded  or  empty,  light  or  dark,  airy  or 
close,  lately  whitewashed  or  bedaubed  with  dirt,  appa- 
rently dry  or  fungus  covered  ;  and  it  is  precisely  to 
this  class  of  facts  I  have  professed  to  bear  witness. 
Not  one  of  my  alleged  facts,  however,  so  far  as 
I  know,  has  been  disproved  ;  but  horrible  pictures 
have  been  drawn  by  **  P.  Krapotkine,"  in  the  Nineteenth 
Century*  and  by  others,  of  certain  prisons,  which 
for  the  most  part  I  have  not  visited,  and  so  cannot 
contradict  from  personal  testimony,  except  perhaps 
in  the  case  of  the  fortress  prison  in  Petersburg, 
to  the  description  of  which  I  shall  now  invite  the 
reader's  attention,  and  notice  certain  other  objections 
in  passing.

CHAPTER  XLIII. 

THE  FORTRESS  PRISON  IN  PETERSBURG. 

Difficulty  of  obtaining  admittance,. and  facility  of  misrepresentation. — 
Letter  alleged  to  have  been  written  therefrom  in  blood. — Descrip- 
tion of  Troubetzkoy  Bastion  :  its  cells,  occupants,  and  diet. — The 
Courtine  of  Catherine  II. — Place  for  visits  of  friends,  and  for  trials. 
— ^The  library. — Cells  for  military  officers,  and  garden. — Inquiry 
for  oubliettes  and  underground  dungeons. — Testimony  of  official 
eye-witnesses. — Testimony  of  ex-prisoners. — Examination  of  state- 
ments in  the  Nineteenth  Century. — Insufficient  evidence  as  to 
alleged  torture  of  prisoners. 

THE  prison  for  political  offenders  in  the  fortress 
of  SS.  Peter  and  Paul  at  Petersburg  has  long 
been  an  exhaustless  mine  for  the  horror-monger, 
whose  delineations  found,  at  any  rate  until  quite 
recently,  negative  support  in  the  extreme  jealousy  of 
the  authorities  of  any  investigation  by  outsiders. 

I  asked  to  see  this  particular  prison  or  the  one  at 
Schlusselburg  (I  forget  which),  in  1878,  but  was 
denied.  When,  however,  in  1882,  I  found  the  authori- 
ties willing  to  grant  me  all  I  desired  with  regard 
to  Central  Asia,  I  made  bold  to  ask  Count  Tolstoy, 
the  Minister  of  the  Interior,  whether  I  might  not  also 
be  allowed  to  visit  the  State  prison  in  the  fortress. 
His  Excellency  had  kindly  assured  me  that  he  would 
do  everything  for  me  that  he  could  ;  but,  on  receiving 


THE  FORTRESS  PRISON  IN  PETERSBURG,        641 

this  request,  I  fancied  he  winced  a  little,  and  at  first 
said  **  No."  I  urged,  however,  that  the  enemies  of 
Russia,  and  those  who  would  rather  not  hear  any  good 
of  her,  had  said  that  in  my  inspection  of  Siberian 
prisons  the  worst  had  not  been  shown  me ;  also  that 
in  the  fortress  prison  abominations  were  commonly 
alleged  to  exist,  which  I  could  not  gainsay  so  long 
as  I  had  not  personally  inspected  the  building. 
This  seemed  to  fetch  the  Count,  who  told  me  I 
might  come  on  the  following  Saturday  for  a  "Yes'' 
or  '*No";  the  reason  for  the  delay  being,  I  after- 
wards heard,  that  on  the  Friday  the  Minister  in- 
tended to  submit  my  application  to  the  Emperor.  I 
went  on  the  Saturday  morning,  and  was  told  that  / 
might  see  everything^  and  choose  my  own  time  to  do 
so.  I  elected  to  go  within  a  very  few  hours — on  the 
afternoon  of  the  same  day — being  not  unmindful  of 
what  had  been  said  about  prisons  being  prepared  for 
me.  As  a  Russian  gentleman,  who  had  accompanied 
me  in  the  city  to  interpret,  fought  shy  of  going  with 
me  to  the  prison,  lest  it  should  in  any  way  bring  him 
under  suspicion,  the  police-master  spared  me  his  sec- 
retary. Thus  prepared,  I  went  to  the  fortress,  was 
introduced  to  the  Commandant,  General  Ganetzky, 
one  of  the  heroes  of  Plevna,  and  then,  accompanied 
by  the  secretary  of  the  fortress  and  the  governor 
of  the  prison,  proceeded  to  my  inspection.  I 
described  my  visit  in  the  Contemporary  Review 
for  February,  1883,  and  the  contribution  was  ad- 
versely criticised  in  the  following  June  number  of 
the  Nineteenth  Century^  by  Prince  Krapotkine,  whilst 
in  the  Times  of  the  next  December  7th  there  appeared 
a  communication  respecting  the  Troubetzkoy  Bastion 
in  the  fortress  prison,  and  its  horrors,  of  the  most 
VOL.  I.  41 


642  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Startling  character.  As  I  read  the  letter,  less  than 
a  column  long,  with  pencil  in  hand,  I  marked  no  less 
than  38  places  that  seemed  to  me  errors,  misrepre- 
sentations, exaggerations,  or  doubtful  passages  ;  whilst, 
from  certain  discrepancies  between  the  writer's  state- 
ments, and  what  I  saw  myself,  and  was  told  by  two 
ex-prisoners  from  the  fortress,  I  strongly  suspected 
that  the  correspondent  had  not  been  confined  in  the 
fortress  at  all.  I  wrote  to  the  Times  to  say  so,  but 
the  late  editor  did  not  insert  my  letter,  though  I 
happen  to  know  that  from  the  first  he  had  some  doubt 
whether  the  affair  were  not  a  hoax.  Perhaps  it  was 
well  that  my  strictures  did  not  appear,  for  the  un- 
answered allegations  led  an  **  Englishman  "  (whom  I 
shall  so  designate  hereafter)  to  visit  the  Troubetzkoy 
Bastion,  and  to  write  afterwards  to  the  Pall  Mall 
Gazette  of  13th  February,  1884.  He  said  that  the 
letter  was  well  known  to  the  police  in  Petersburg,  and 
had  been  written — not  from  the  fortress  in  blood,  but 
— in  red  ink  at  Geneva.  Thus  I  have  the  testimony 
of  the  "  Englishman*'  to  confirm  my  own  observations, 
and  to  assist  me  in  my  passing  remarks  on  what 
Prince  Krapotkine  and  the  letter  writer  have  said. 

Two  buildings  within  the  fortress  walls  now  serve 
as  prisons — the  "  Troubetzkoy  Bastion,"  and  the 
**  Courtine  of  Catherine  II."  The  Troubetzkoy 
prison  consists  of  72  cells,  in  two  stories,  built  or 
arranged  in  their  present  form  about  1870.  The 
windows  of  the  cells  look  out  on  to  the  outer  fortress 
wall,  from  which  the  building  is  separated  by  a  court 
about  20  feet  wide.  The  doors  of  the  cells  open  in  one 
wall  of  a  wide  passage,  down  the  centre  of  which  lies 
a  piece  of  matting,  deadening  the  footsteps  of  passers- 
by.     As  we  entered  the  passage,  a  hush  was  called  (I 


THE  FORTRESS  PRISON  IN  PETERSBURG,        643 

suppose  in  order  that  the  nearest  prisoner  might  not 
be  aware  of  our  presence),  and  the  cover  of  an  inspec- 
tion hole  was  gently  raised  that  I  might  look  within. 
The  name,  too,  of  the  occupant  was  given  me,  it  being 
none  other  than  that  of  the  man  who  took  a  shop  and 
made  a  mine  under  one  of  the  streets*  of  Petersburg 
with  the  diabolical  design  of  blowing  up  the  late 
Emperor.  Of  course  I  peeped  breathlessly  in,  and 
duly  prepared  my  nerves  to  see  how  this  arch  offender 
was  being  treated,  and  what  likelihood  there  seemed 
of  his  losing  his  health,  or  reason,  or  of  sinking  into 
the  ghastly  condition  of  political  prisoners  as  described 
in  the  Nineteenth  Century.  But  the  man  appeared  to 
be  bearing  his  fate  better  than  was  to  be  expected. 
He  seemed  to  be  in  good  health,  and  showed  not 
the  least  tendency  to  insanity.  In  fact,  he  was  lying 
at  full  length  on  his  bed,  with  his  toes  in  the  air, 
reading  a  book,  and  smoking  a  cigar ! 

I  was  not  invited,  and  I  did  not  ask,  to  enter  the 
compartment,  but  passed  on  to  an  adjoining  and  similar 
cell,  to  examine  it  minutely.  It  measured  (roughly) 
23  feet  long  by  ri  broad  and  10  high.  The  window 
was  not  of  ground  or  corrugated  glass,  but  was  too 
high  to  allow  of  the  prisoner  looking  out.  It  was  large 
enough  to  admit  a  sufficiency  of  light  by  day,  and  all 
through  the  winter  nights  there  was  kept  burning,  not 
a  miserable  rushlight,  but  a  good  oil  lamp,  such  as  I 
have  never  seen  in  a  prison  before  or  since.  There 
was  a  supply  of  water,  with  a  drinking  cup,  and  a 
salt-cellar  ;  and  the  sanitary  arrangements,  though  not 
quite  up  to  the  present  standard,  would  have  passed 
muster  at  the  time  the  cells  were  constructed.  The 
floor  was  of  asphalte  ;  and  the  room  was  warmed 
by  a  petchka    or   stove,    and   ventilated ;    was   fitted 


644  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

with  an  air  bell,  and  had  in  it  an  iron  table  and 
bedstead.  On  the  latter  was  placed  first  a  mattress 
of  straw,  then  one  of  flock,  with  two  feather  pillows, 
such  as  I  have  never  seen  provided  in  any  other 
prison. 

The  diet  was  represented  to  be  as  follows  :  dinner 
at  I  o'clock,  consisting  of  two  courses — the  first,  stcfiee, 
or  soup,  in  which  by  law  i  lb.  of  meat  for  each  prisoner 
must  have  been  boiled ;  the  second,  a  plate  of  roast 
meat  with  potatoes,  and  fresh  vegetables  when  plentiful. 
For  supper,  soup  only  is  provided,  and  there  is  given 
to  each  prisoner  daily  ij  lb.  of  rye  bread.  This 
allowance  of  bread  struck  me  as  small  compared  with 
that  of  other  Russian  prisons,  and  I  said  so  ;  but  the 
secretary  replied  that  most  of  the  fortress  prisoners 
either  had  money  with  which  they  bought  white  bread, 
or  friends  who  brought  it,  with  other  kinds  of  food ; 
and  further,  that  if  the  allowance  were  not  enough, 
the  prisoners  had  only  to  ask  for  more,  to  get  it. 
Also  they  might  purchase  extras,  and  I  noticed,  in 
almost  every  cell  I  looked  into,  a  box  of  cigarettes. 
Smoking,  they  said,  was  forbidden  by  law,  but  the 
Commandant  might  allow  it. 

Prisoners  awaiting  their  trial  could  receive  visits 
from  friends  for  half  an  hour  once  a  fortnight,  or 
oftener  if  the  friends  coming  from  a  distance  remained 
only  a  short  time  at  the  capital ;  but,  when  sentenced, 
a  man  could  receive  no  more  visits  from  friends  until 
he  had  left  the  fortress  and  arrived  at  his  place  of 
destination.  For  those  who  needed  it,  there  was 
provided  a  suit  of  coarse  linen  and  a  loose  coat,  but 
most  of  those  detained  in  the  fortress  wore  their  own 
clothes.  There  was  a  bath-house  visited  by  the 
prisoners  once  a  month,  or  oftener  if  they  wish,  and 


THE  FORTRESS  PRISON  IN  PETERSBURG.        645 

there  were  shown  me  certain  ordinary  cells  that 
could  be  darkened  for  punishment. 

Behind  the  building  was  a  garden  used  for  exercise, 
of  which,  however,  each  prisoner,  at  the  time  of  my 
.visit,  had  only  a  scanty  allowance — sometimes  not 
more  than  20  minutes  a  day.  I  thought  this  bad, 
and  said  so,  but  was  told  that  only  one  prisoner 
at  a  time  was  allowed  to  be  in  the  garden,  and  that 
there  were  then  from  30  to  40  to  exercise  daily. 
This  is  noteworthy  because  the  letter  writer  says 
that  in  taking  exercise  the  prisoners  walk  "  in  Indian 
file.'' 

In  the  lower  story  women  were  detained.  I  looked 
through  an  inspection  hole  at  one  of  forbidding  coun- 
tenance, who  was  reading.  She  had  been  captured 
only  a  few  days  previously  among  a  gang  of  Nihilists, 
whose  rendeZ'VOus  had  been  discovered  not  far  dis- 
tant on  the  Vassili  Ostrofif.*  As  I  went  along  the 
passages  I  looked  into  what  cells  I  pleased,  and  if  I 
asked  the  names  of  the  occupants  they  were  given. 

After  walking  through  the  Troubetzkoy  Bastion, 
and  seeing  as  much  as  I  wished,  we  proceeded  to 
the  Courtine  of  Catherine  II.  close  by.  I  suppose 
this  to  be  xh^  proper  name  of  this  part  of  the  building, 
but  it  has  occurred  to  me  that  its  cells  or  rooms  are 
what  several  writers  have  called  the  "  Underground 
casemates "  of  the  fortress.  At  least  I  saw  no  other 
parts  of  the  building  that  agreed  with  this  expression. 
Webster   describes    a    casemate    as    a    **  bomb-proof 

♦The  letter  writer  states  that  "under  the  pretext  of  searching  the 
women,  they  often  cause  them  to  be  stripped  naked  in  the  presence  of 
a  bevy  of  gendarmes.**  But  why  should  they?  There  are  plenty  of 
female  warders  across  the  river,  if  not  in  the  fortress,  where  there  are 
the  wives  of  the  soldiers,  who,  "  Englishman  **  says,  wait  on  the  women 
when  necessary.

chamber,  usually  of  masonry,  in   which    cannon  may 
be  placed,  to  be  fired  through  embrasures  ;  or  capable 
of  being  used  as  a  magazine,  or  for  quartering  troops," 
and  the  French  dictionary  describes  a  **courtine"  as 
**a  wall  between  two  bastions."    Both  these  descriptions 
agree   with    the  Courtine  of  Catherine    II.,    and   the 
casemates    are    in    a    sense    *' underground,"    in    that 
earth  is  put  on  the  roofs  to  make  them  bomb-proof,  or 
again  as  the  London  high-level   railway  arches  with 
ballast   on  the   top  might   by  an  abuse  of  language 
be  called   **  underground."       In   fact,    the   interior  of 
one   of  the   cells    with    rounded    roof   reminded    me 
exactly  of  a  London  railway  arch  turned  into  a  store- 
room, with  the  floor  a  few  feet  below  the  springers. 
The  embrasures  had  no  cannon,  but  were  glazed,  and 
the  windows,  with  several  feet  of  scarp  wall  below, 
looked    out   on   a   garden    and    over   the    Neva.      I 
did  not   measure  the  rooms,  but  they  struck  me   as 
larger  than  those  in  the  Troubetzkoy  Bastion,  and  I 
observed  no  damp  on  the  walls.     The  rooms  below,  I 
was  given  to  understand,  are  no  longer  used  as  cells ; 
though   I   observe  that  "Englishman**  speaks  of  the 
bottom  of  these  walls  as  damp,    and   says  that   the 
lower  part  of  the   prison  is  used  only  when  the  72 
cells  of  the  Troubetzkoy  Bastion  are  full.     They  have 
usually  from  20  to  40  prisoners.     At  the  time  of  my 
visit  there  were  38. 

We  entered  first  the  place  in  which  prisoners  see 
their  friends,  behind  wire  grating  as  in  other  prisons, 
but  with  square  apertures  larger  than  usual,  through 
which  prisoner  and  friend  could  see  each  other  clearly, 
and  pass  commodities  in  the  presence  of  an  officer.  A 
couch  and  cane-bottomed  chairs  were  provided  for 
friends    and    prisoner   alike,    and    the    place    looked 


THE  FORTRESS  PRISON  IN  PETERSBURG.        647 

somewhat  less  gloomy  than  in  many  prisons.  Further 
on,  however,  was  a  chamber  that  called  up  ideas  any- 
thing but  pleasant.  It  was  a  large  room,  with  low 
vaulted  roof,  in  which  commissioners  formerly  sat  to 
conduct  trials,  commencing  to  do  so  in  1861.  Some 
celebrated  trials  in  1866,  I  was  informed,  were  con- 
ducted here ;  but  the  chamber,  after  serving  this 
purpose  for  12  years,  ceased  to  be  used,  though 
it  is  still  to  some  extent  furnished.  As  at  Newgate, 
the  accused  could  be  brought  from  their  cells  to  the 
place  of  judgment  without  going  outside  the  prison 
gates.  Beyond  this  hall  of  judgment  was  the  library, 
which  I  could  not  enter,  as  the  librarian  was  away. 
It  was  said  to  contain  from  600  to  700  volumes 
in  Russian,  French,  German,  and  English.  The 
prisoners,  I  was  told,  read  a  great  deal — indeed, 
I  saw  many  so  doing.  A  copy  of  the  Gospels  or  of 
the  New  Testament  is  placed  in  every  room,  and  the 
library  books  may  be  had  for  the  asking.  Periodicals 
and  newspapers  are  also  provided,  but  not  less  than 
a  year  old,  the  authorities  not  thinking  it  desirable 
that  persons  awaiting  their  trial  should  see  themselves 
figuring  in  print.  Should  new  books,  however,  be 
required,  of  a  scientific  or  technical  character  for 
instance,  they  are  allowed.* 

The  prisoners'  rooms  in  the  Courtine  were  not 
numerous,  though  there  were  other  unused  chambers 
en  suite.  The  men  confined  in  this  part  were  chiefly, 
if  not  entirely,  military  officers,  the  Russian  code 
prescribing  that  certain  military  offences  (not  neces- 
sarily political)    should   be   expiated  by  imprisonment 

*  Yet  the  letter  writer  **  in  blood  '*  says,  "Worst  of  all,  there  are  no 
books,  no  paper, — there  is  absolutely  nothing  to  do  :  nothing  to  relieve 
the  complete  solitude  and  silence ;   even  the  Bible  is  denied  them.*' 


648  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA.

in  a  fortress  for  a  period  not  exceeding  three   years  I 

and    three    months.     There    were    six    chambers  for  " 

ordinary  prisoners,  and  also  three  very  large  rooms 
for  those  condemned  to  death,  with  whom  are  placed 
two  warders  (as  in  England)  from  the  day  on  which 
sentence  is  passed  to  the  hour  of  execution.  There 
was  no  one  in  the  fortress  condemned  to  death  at 
the  time  of  my  visit,  but  I  entered  one  of  the 
rooms,  and  then  proceeded  to  the  cell  (if  such  it  could 
be  called)  of  an  officer  sentenced  to  four  months' 
confinement.  The  room  was  furnished  with  Vienna 
chairs,  had  a  bouquet  of  flowers  on  the  table-cloth, 
and  contained,  among  other  things  that  attracted  my 
attention,  a  neat  carpenter's  bench,  and  an  amateurs 
box  of  tools.  None  of  the  fortress  prisoners  are 
obliged  to  work,  but  this  officer  chose  to  employ  his 
time  in  making  fancy  and  fretwork  articles,  specimens 
of  which  were  seen  about  the  room. 

The  prisoners  in  the  Courtine  had  a  less  unpleasant 
time  than  their  comrades  in  the  Troubetzkoy  Bastion 
with  regard  to  exercise,  for  they  could,  if  they  chose, 
spend  the  greater  part  of  the  summer  day  (from  noon 
to  eight)  in  the  garden,  and  that  in  company  of  one 
another.  I  walked  round  the  enclosure,  which  com- 
mands a  splendid  view  of  the  Neva,  and  was  fairly 
taken  aback  by  what  I  saw.  There  was  no  lack  of 
flowers  (tended,  I  believe,  by  the  prisoners),  and  an 
abundance  of  shady  trees,  between  two  of  which  a 
hammock  was  swung,  whilst  not  far  off  were  a  pair 
of  gymnastic  bars,  a  summer-house,  and  a  tent.  The 
animal  world  was  represented  by  a  goat  cropping  the 
grass,  and  two  playful  puppies  belonging  to  some 
officers,  who,  in  a  knot  of  four,  were  lounging  about 
under  no  visible  surveillance.     In  the  garden,  in  one 


THE  FORTRESS  PRISON  IN  PETERSBURG,        649 

place  which  was  damp,  there  was  an  offensive  smell, 
but  I  detected  nothing  of  the  kind  elsewhere. 

Need  I  add  that  I  saw  no  torture-chamber,  or  any 
similar  abomination  ?  What,  then,  can  have  become  of 
the  **  cac/wiSy'  ''oubliettes,''  and  dismal  chambers  which 
have  been  connected  with  the  **  Peter  and  Paul "  by  so 
many,  and  by  some,  too,  whose  testimony  is  worthy 
of  respectful  consideration  ?  I  do  not  allude  to  the 
exaggerated  and  vindictive  expressions  of  released 
prisoners,  who  overreach  their  aim  when  they  vilify 
the  land  of  their  punishment ;  nor  to  the  stories  of  the 
Great  Peter's  days  that  have  descended  from  father  to 
son,  and  been  questioned  by  neither  though  garnished 
by  both.  I  am  thinking  rather  of  the  testimony  of  such 
men  as  the  Decembrists,  one  of  whom  told  me  that 
not  he,  but  one  of  his  comrades,  was  confined  for  many 
years  in  the  fortress  in  a  cachot;  and  another,  writing 
an  account,  which  still  exists  in  manuscript,  of  his  exile, 
for  his  wife  and  children,  describes  his  cell  at  the  for- 
tress at  Petersburg  as  **very  small,  dirty,  and  dark." 
I  can  only  reconcile  these  statements  with  what  I  saw 
by  one  of  two  suggestions.  It  will  be  remembered 
that  the  insurrection  of  the  Decembrists  took  place  in 
1825,  in  December  (whence  their  name),  and  that  not 
a  mere  handful  of  assassins,  but  whole  regiments 
led  by  their  officers,  attempted  to  deprive  the 
Emperor  Nicholas  of  his  throne.  The  number  of  per- 
sons arrested  must  therefore  have  been  very  great,  and 
the  fortress  may  well  have  been  overfilled,  so  that 
every  possible  corner  would  have  to  be  occupied  ; 
and  if  one  remembers  what  our  own  prisons  in 
England  were  half  a  century  ago,  it  need  not  seem 
surprising  if  some  at  least  of  the  places  of  detention  in 
the  fortress  could  be   described  as  "dark,  dirty,  and 


650  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

small."  The  occasion  and  the  number  of  the  prisoners 
was  abnormal  and  temporary,  and  the  then  exceptional 
condition  of  things  ought  not,  without  additional  proof, 
to  be  brought  forward  as  representing  the  condition  of 
things  now. 

The  other  suggestion  is  that  a  part  of  the  fortress 
now  altered  or  taken  down  may  have  contained  these 
gloomy  places.  More  than  one  of  those  whom  I  told  of 
my  visit  asked  if  1  had  seen  the  *'  Alexeievsky  Ravelin," 
and  upon  my  replying  in  the  negative,  they  said  that  a 
third  prison  of  the  fortress'  had  not  been  shown  me. 
But  an  official,  high  in  the  prison  administration,  and 
whom  I  have  known  for  some  time,  told  me,  a  day  or 
two  before  I  went,  that  the  part  of  the  fortress  in  the 
thick  wall  of  which  cells  were  long  ago  formed,  is  no 
longer  used  as  a  prison,  and  that  the  cells  are  abolished. 
I  expressly  asked,  when  going  over  the  buildings,  if 
there  were  any  subterranean  chambers  or  cells,  and 
was  told  *'  No."  Inasmuch,  then,  as  I  have  not  yet 
detected  the  Russian  prison  authorities  on  any  one 
occasion  trying  to  deceive  me,  I  am  bound  to  believe 
what  they  say,  until  someone  can  show  proof  to  the  con- 
trary. If  anyone  denied  to  me  that  there  were  dark 
cells  in  Newgate  I  could  in  six  lines  give  so  minute  a 
direction  that  a  Russian  entering  the  prison  for  the  first 
time  should  be  able  to  find  them ;  but  for  anyone  to 
say,  like  the  **  blood-red  "  letter  writer,  that  there  are 
in  the  fortress  **  underground  cells  where  a  ray  of  sun- 
light never  enters,  where  offensive  water  oozes  through 
the  walls,  and  fungus  grows  on  all  sides,"  is  not  suffi- 
ciently definite  as  to  locality.  Prince  Krapotkine,  after 
speaking  of  the  Troubetzkoy  Bastion,  says  :  **The  floor 
of  the  cells  is  covered  with  a  painted  felt,  and  the  walls 
are  made  double  with  felt  to  prevent  the  prisoners  from 


THE  FORTRESS  PRISON  IN  PETERSBURG,        651 

speaking  to  one  another  by  tapping," — a  very  proper 
device  of  the  authorities  if  it  were  so,  but  it  was  not 
the  case  in  the  cells  I  entered  or  looked  into.  Again, 
he  says  that  the  prisoners  I  saw  were  awaiting  trial, 
and  that  it  is  after  trial  that  they  are  put  into  the 
horrible  places  he  describes ;  but  his  testimony  fails  to 
convince  me  because  he  does  not  sufficiently  particu- 
larize the  locality  of  the  cells  so  that  an  independent 
person  might  test  the  accuracy  of  his  statements. 

So  much,  then,  for  what  I  saw  ;  and,  had  I  left  Russia 
immediately  after  my  visit,  this  is  all  I  could  have  said  ; 
but,  as  I  continued  my  journey,  I  met  here  and  there 
persons  who  knew  the  fortress,  and  with  whom  I  could 
compare  notes.  So  contradictory  to  current  opinion  on 
the  subject  was  my  experience,  that  with  a  view  to 
publication  I  wrote  a  short  paper,  and  read  it  to  several 
Russians,  including  a  legal  gentleman  who  had  held  a 
prominent  position  in  the  **  third  section,"  and  who  on 
one  occasion,  summoned  by  telegram,  went  to  the  for- 
tress to  receive  from  a  noted  offender  some  statement 
he  wished  to  make.  My  informant  told  me  that  he 
went  to  the  Alexeievsky  Ravelin,  out  of  which,  he  said, 
prisoners  did  not  come  without  permission  of  the  Em- 
peror. He  descended  to  cells  underground,  which 
were  large  and  airy,  but  lighted  from  the  corridor 
above,  hardly  enough,  he  said,  to  read,  though  the 
prisoner  might  call  for  a  lamp.  This  was  about  3 
o'clock  in  the  afternoon,  but  whether  winter  or  summer 
I  know  not ;  if  the  former,  then  the  deficiency  of 
light  at  that  time  of  day  in  Petersburg  would  easily 
be  accounted  for,  and  it  also  leaves  room  for  doubt 
whether  the  lawyer  may  not  have  been  mistaken  as  to 
the  cells  being  underground.  This  was  the  only  time 
he  visited  the  prison,  and  I  suggest  the  possibility  of 


652  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

his  being  mistaken,  because  the  position  of  the  cells 
does  not  agree  with  what  was  told  me  further  on,  by  a 
chief  of  gendarmerie,  whom  I  met  at  dinner,  who  knew 
the'  fortress,  and  said  there  used  to  be  a  part  of  the 
building,  of  three  stories,  called  the  Alexeievsky 
Ravelin,  but  he  knew  nothing  of  cells  underground. 
The  **  oubliettes,''  he  thought,  had  not  been  used  since 
the  days  of  the  Emperor  Paul,  and  he  did  not  believe 
in  the  torture  of  prisoners  in  the  fortress  now. 

But  besides  the  testimony  of  these  two  witnesses 
I  met  other  two,  who  had  been  confined  in  the  for- 
tress. Both  of  them  are  now  filling  important  positions, 
are  highly  respected,  and  no  one,  or  almost  no  one, 
about  them  has  any  idea  of  their  having  been  in  prison. 
Of  course,. therefore,  I  cannot  give  their  names  ;  but  I 
shall  call  them  Messrs.  Jones  and  Robinson.  Mr.  Jones, 
who  is  a  British  subject,  had  the  misfortune  to  fall 
under  the  suspicion  of  the  authorities,  through  being 
found  in  the  same  lodgings  with  a  political  miscreant. 
Accordingly,  about  1 866,  he  was  taken  one  night  from 
a  restaurant  by  the  police,  placed  on  a  droshky,  hurried 
ofif,  and  lodged  in  the  fortress.  The  next  morning  a 
clerk  came  and  asked  him  sundry  questions,  and  among 
others  whether  he  knew  where  he  was.  The  clerk, 
however,  declined  to  answer,  in  turn,  any  questions 
put  by  the  prisoner,  who  asked  in  vain  for  books, 
though  he  was  allowed  to  have  pens,  ink,  and  paper. 
His  food,  he  told  me,  was  good,  but  he  had  no  white 
bread  or  tea.  He  was  not  allowed  to  smoke,  or  send 
out  for  cigars.  When  necessity  required  him  to  leave 
his  cell,  he  was  taken  out  and  brought  back  by  gen- 
darmes, but  during  the  few  days  he  was  in  prison  he 
was  not  let  out  for  exercise.  I  asked  him  about  **  tor- 
ture," but  he  said  that  no  violence  was  used  towards 


THE  FORTRESS  PRISON  IN  PETERSBURG,        653 

him,  though  a  friend  of  his,  confined  in  1 866,  had  told 
him  that  during  his  examination  he  was  switched  with 
a  rod  as  punishment,  but  not  with  a  view  to  extort  con- 
fession. On  the  fifth  day  my  informant  was  taken  to 
the  arched  chamber  for  examination,  and,  while  waiting 
in  the  ante- room,  heard  another  prisoner  inside  swear- 
ing and  stamping  with  rage.  His  own  examination 
lasted  about  a  quarter  of  an  hour,  and  on  the  seventh 
day  he  was  whisked  out  of  prison,  much  in  the  fashion 
he  had  been  brought  in,  at  i  o'clock  in  the  morning. 

I  pass  now  to  the  testimony  of  Mr.  Robinson,  a 
Russian,  in  whose  presence  I  had  been  speaking  of  my 
visit  to  the  fortress,  when  he  called  me  aside  and  said, 
**  You  will  be  surprised,  perhaps,  to  hear  that  I  know 
the  fortress.  No  one  in  this  town  is  aware  of  it,  but 
20  years  ago  I  was  imprisoned  there,  on  political 
charges,  for  three  years."  A  revolutionary  correspon- 
dent, he  told  me,  had  written  to  him,  proposing  that  he 
should  be  chief  commissioner  for  a  certain  city,  for  the 
distribution  of  revolutionary  publications,  that  the  letter 
had  been  opened  and  he  had  been  arrested  on  the 
strength  of  it.  Accordingly  I  made  an  appointment  to 
see  him  in  private,  and  on  my  not  arriving  quite 
so  early  as  he  expected,  he  busied  himself  in  making  a 
pen-and-ink  sketch,  which  is  now  in  my  possession,  of 
his  cell  in  the  Alexeievsky  Ravelin.  It  was  furnished 
with  table,  chair,  commode  (taken  away  ipimediately 
after  use  and  cleaned  by  a  soldier),  and  a  bed,  with  two 
feather  pillows,  a  pair  of  sheets,  blanket,  and  woollen 
coverlet.  The  cell  measured  1 8  feet  8  inches  long,  by 
16  feet  4  inches  broad,  and  9  feet  4  inches  high.  The 
window  was  nearly  7  feet  high,  and  doubled  in  winter ; 
the  two  lower  sashes  being  whitewashed,  but  not  so  the 
top,  out  of  which  the  prisoner  could  look  by  standing 


654  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

Up.     The  room  was  yellowwashed  and  painted  once  a 
year,  during  which  operation  its  occupant  was  removed 
at  various  times  to  four  or  five  other  cells  like  his  own. 
The  painted  floor  was  washed  once  a  week,  but  not  by 
the  prisoner.     He  said  he  had   no  trouble  about  his 
room,  for  at  half-past  seven  a.m.  four  soldiers  entered 
his  cell.     One  poured  water  in  Russian  fashion  on  Mr. 
Robinson's  hands,  and  another  held  his  comb,  whilst 
the  remaining  two  cleaned  the   room.     This  sort   of 
attendance  was  continued  at  the  bath,  visited  once  a 
fortnight,  where  the  soldier^   waited  on  him,  even  to 
putting  on   his   socks.     He  wore  the  prison  clothes, 
including  a  grey  flannel  dressing-gown  (or  kftalai),  and 
had  clean  linen  for  bed  and  back  once  a  week.     At 
eight  o'clock  there  was  brought  a  glass  of  tea,  sugar, 
and  white  bread.     Dinner  followed  at  one,  consisting 
ordinarily  of  three  dishes,  but  in  Easter  week  of  four, 
preceded,  if  he  chose,  by  a  glass  of  vodka,  or  spirits. 
The  first  dish  was  of  soup,   with   the  beef,  veal,   or 
chicken  of  which  it  had  been  made  ;  the  second  was  of 
roast  beef,  fowl,  or  game,  but  so  varied  that  the  same 
second  dish  did  not  appear  twice  in  any  week  during 
the  whole  three  years  he  was  there.     The  third  dish 
was  of  rice  pudding,  buckwheat,  jam  pancakes,  etc., 
etc.,  the  portions,  always  well  cooked,  being  so  large 
that  he  could  not  eat  the  whole.     At  six  o'clock  came 
again  tea,  sugar,  and  white  bread,  black  bread  being 
served  only  for  dinner.     After  making  notes  of  this, 
and  that  he  might  if  he  chose  purchase  extras,   I  was 
fully  prepared  to  hear  Mr.   Robinson  say  that  at  the 
end  of  three  years  he  left  the  fortress  heavier  by  30  lbs. 
Russian  than  he  entered,  his  former  weight  being  I44lbs. 
English.     He  said  that  he  was  in  solitary  confinement, 
but  that  a  captain  came  almost  daily  to  ask  if  he  had 


THE  FORTRESS  PRISON  IN  PETERSBURG.        655 

complaints  to  make,  which  complaints  when  set  forth 
were  duly  attended  to.  The  Commandant  of  the 
fortress  came  once  a  month  ;  and  once  a  year  also  a 
special  messenger  {chief  of  the  gendarmerie)  from  the 
Emperor.  Mr.  Robinson  spoke  of  the  prison  officers 
as  even  **  polite,"  and  said  that  the  chief  (when  not 
drunk!)  used  often  to  come  and  talk  for  an  hour. 
Again,  that  on  one  occasion  Mezentseff  (chief  of  the 
secret  police,  who  was  murdered  by  the  Nihilists  in 
1879)  asked  him  if  he  would  like  to  smoke,  in  which 
case  he  should  be  supplied  with  a  \  lb.  of  tobacco  for 
cigarettes  every  other  day.  He  also  asked  if  he  would 
like  to  paint  or  write  ;  and  books  from  the  library  and 
drawing  materials  were  brought  to  him.  It  was  in  this 
fortress  prison,  he  said,  that  he  read  *' Gibbon's  Decline 
and  Fall  of  the  Roman  Empire." 

This  testimony  of  Mr.  Robinson  is  in  striking  con- 
trast to  the  article  to  which  I  have  called  attention, 
saying  that  in  the  Ravelin  was  disallowed  **  everything 
that  might  help  to  occupy  the  attention,"  for  here  was 
written  the  Russian  novel,  Tchto  Dyealit  ?  ("  What's 
to  be  Done?"),  published  in  1863  in  the  Sovremennik 
(or  Contemporary).  Mr.  Robinson  told  me  that  Tcher- 
nichevsky,  the  author,  was  with  him  in  the  Ravelin, 
and  wrote  it  there.  So  that  Tchernichevsky's  mind 
did  not  decay  for  want  of  occupation.  Mr.  Robinson 
said  that  he  never  heard  or  saw  anything  corroborative 
of  prisoners  being  tortured  in  the  fortress.  I  have 
heard  of  prisoners  being  fed  with  salt  herrings,  and 
given  no  water  to  drink.  Prince  Krapotkine,  too, 
asserts  that  at  least  two  revolutionists  were  submitted 
to  torture  by  electricity.  But  he  declines  to  give  any 
particulars  to  support  his  statement.  When  persons 
have  told  me  of  such  things  I  used  to  ask  the  ques- 


656  RUSSIAN"  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

tion,  **  Out  of  the  hundreds  of  prisoners  who  have 
passed  through  the  fortress,  do  you  know  of  one 
who  has  asserted  that  he  was  put  to  torture  ?  *'  and 
an  affirmative  answer  has  not  yet  been  forthcoming. 
If  torture  in  the  fortress  is  inflicted,  can  no  one  be 
found  to  tell  us  with  some  closeness  of  detail  wlieUy 
where,  and  how  he  was  made  to  suffer  ?  Such  things, 
if  done,  could  not  well  have  been  hid.  Further, 
Robinson  had  a  friend  who  had  been  four  times  in  the 
fortress,  and  many  other  acquaintances  likely  to  know 
the  truth,  but  none  of  these  had  ever  spoken  to  him 
of  cruelties  enacted  there. 

I  have  no  information  respecting  sickness,  deaths, 
or  insanity  in  the  fortress.  During  Robinson's  three 
years'  confinement  two  prisoners  went  mad  through 
their  own  fault  and  secret  sin.  But  the  writer  of  the 
apocryphal  letter  perpetrates  a  strange  anachronism 
when  he  says,  **  Even  those  who  become  mad  are  not 
treated  any  better.  They  are  strapped  down  and 
beaten  with  the  knout."  Now,  I  am  informed  by  a 
Russian  nobleman  that  the  knout  was  not  at  any 
time  used  as  an  instrument  of  correction  in  prisons, 
but  instead  of  capital  punishment.  But,  however  this 
may  be,  the  **  knout "  proper  (which  is  the  Russian 
word  for  a  whip)  was  abolished  so  long  ago  that  I 
have  been  unable  to  get  one  for  my  collection  of 
prison  curiosities,  and  it  was  with  great  difficulty, 
when  writing  "  Through  Siberia,''  that  I  found  an 
old  man  who  could  describe  what  it  used  to  be  like. 

I  have  no  recollection  of  seeing  any  chapel  in  the 
prison,  though  of  course  there  is  the  well-known 
church  close  at  hand  within  the  fortress  wall.  Mr. 
Robinson  did  not  go  to  church  during  his  imprisonment, 
but  a  priest  came  thrice  a  year,  and  administered  the 


* 


THE  FORTRESS  PRISON  IN  PETERSBURG,        657 

sacrament  once.  On  these  occasions  the  prisoners 
learned  from  him  something  of  what  was  going  on  in 
the  outer  world.  Otherwise  my  informant  said  that 
for  the  first  nine  months  he  was  not  allowed  to  see  any 
of  his  relations,  and,  even  then,  only  his  father,  mother, 
and  sister,  in  the  cabinet  of  the  Commandant. 

The  reader  will  have  perceived,  of  course,  that  the 
above  statements  respecting  the  visits  of  friends,  and 
the  rich  table  of  diet  in  the  case  of  Mr.  Robinson,  do 
not  agree  with  what  came  under  my  own  notice  in  the 
prison  itself.  I  do  not  think  it  necessary  to  attempt  to 
reconcile  the  two  accounts,  but  content  myself  with 
having  given  a  faithful  record  of  what  I  saw  and  heard, 
having  extenuated  nothing,  nor  set  down  aught  in 
malice.  Whether  or  not  what  I  have  said  in  **  Through 
Siberia,*'  on  Siberian  convicts  and  gaols,  "  can  only 
convey  false  ideas  "  I  must  leave  to  those  best  quali- 
fied to  judge,  begging  them  to  remember  that  what  I 
am  committed  to  is  simply  an  "unprejudiced  state- 
ment of  what  I  saw  and  heard  in  the  prisons  and 
mines  of  Siberia." 

Around  that  word  "  unprejudiced  '*  I  suspect  the 
remaining  contention  gathers,  for  Prince  Krapotkine 
and  I  do  not  see-  things  from  the  same  standpoint. 
My  critic  calls  some  of  his  prisoner  friends  **  heroes," 
which  is  a  sy^nonym  for  Nihilists  I  could  by  no  means 
accept,  nor  could  I  receive  his  doctrines  enunciated 
in  the  Nineteenth  Century  (January,  1883).  "The 
principle  of  the  lex  talionis,  of  the  right  of  the  com- 
munity to  avenge  itself  on  the  criminal,  is  no  longer 
admissible.  We  have  come  to  an  understanding  *that 
society  at  large  is  responsible  for  the  vices  that  grow 
in  it,  even  as  it  has  its  share  in  the  glories  of  its  heroes  ; 
and  we  generally  admit,  at  least  in  theory,  that  when

we  deprive  a  criminal  of  his  liberty,  it  is  to  purify  and 
improve  him.'*  This,  however  true  and  excellent  in 
the  abstract,  must,  when  interpreted  by  Nihilistic 
events,  be  taken  to  mean  that  when  a  dynamitard,  for 
instance,  has  made  a  mine  and  blown  a  score  or  two  of 
Cossacks  into  eternity,  or  wrecked  a  train,  in  which  some 
individual  may  be,  whose  murder  is  decreed,  the  perpe- 
trator is  not  on  that  account  to  be  made  to  endure  suffer- 
ing as  such,  but  to  be  compassionately  patted  on  the 
back,  and  segregated  to  apartments  where  under  more 
favourable  conditions  he  may  be  purified  and  improved. 
A  comfortable  doctrine  truly,  but  one  not  likely  to  find 
favour  among  the  Cossacks*  widows  and  orphans,  or 
the  maimed  and  mangled  passengers!  The  fallacy 
of  so  pernicious  a  principle  is  self-evident,  and  there 
are  few  who  would  not  say  that  such  a  criminal,  irre- 
spective of  his  future  improvement,  deserved  to  suff*er 
severely,  and  that  whether  acting  for  himself,  or  urged 
on  by  others  to  his  dastardly  work.* 

There  is  room,  no  doubt,  for  difference  of  opinion  as 
to  what  should  be  done  to  this  class  of  offenders  when 

•  I  know  not  who  the  Englishman  may  be  who  went  to  the  fortress 
prison,  and  wrote  to  the  Pail  Mall  Gazette,  but  he  says :  "I  inquired 
into  the  history  of  many  (of  the  prisoners)  I  there  saw,  especially  of  the 
women.  It  was  the  same  sad  stor>'.  Few  had  finished  their  education 
anywhere ;  some  had  been  to  several  g>'mnasia,  and  had  been  forced 
to  leave,  either  through  insubordination,  idleness,  or  intellectual  in- 
capacity. At  war  with  the  school  authorities,  often  smarting  under  a 
sense  of  injustice  real  or  supposed,  they  leave  school  at  war  with  what- 
ever they  have  known  of  law  and  of  authority.  Thus  predisposed, 
they  fall  a  ready  victim  to  men  of  far  more  experience  than  themselves, 
who,  by  appealing  to  the  daring,  the  enthusiasm,  the  courage  of  youth, 
urge  them  on  to  deeds  they  dare  not  do  themselves.  Most  of  the  young 
women  entangled  in  the  fatal  net  of  Nihilism  were  but  inexperienced 
children  when  they  first  began.  Many  young  girls  sent  to  Switzerland 
for  their  education  were  sedulously  sought  after  by  the  Nihilist  refugees 
there.  Appeals  to  their  love  of  country,  their  enthusiasm,  their  youthful 
longing  to  be  something — to  do — were  but  too  successful ;  and  young

caught,  how  the  majesty  of  the  law  should  be  vindi- 
cated, the  body  politic  protected,  and  the  criminal 
reformed.  For  my  own  part,  though  it  is  not  a  pretty 
sight  to  see  a  man's  back  bared  and  a  couple  of 
soldiers  birching  him,  yet  I  never  asked  a  prison 
official  in  England — whether  governor,  turnkey,  or 
chaplain — who  did  not  agree  with  me  that,  if  we  had 
far  more  of  this  mode  of  punishment  than  we  now 
have,  we  should  have  far  fewer  of  a  certain  class  of 
criminals.  I  still  believe  in  the  wisdom  of  the  code 
that  directed  judges  to  justify  the  righteous  and  con- 
demn the  wicked  ;  and  if  the  wicked  man  were  worthy 
to  be  beaten,  that  the  judge  should  cause  him  to  lie 
down,  and  to  be  beaten  before  his  face,  though  not 
without  mercy,  lest  the  offender  should  be  made  vile.* 
In  concluding  this  chapter,  then,  let  me  restate 
what  I  said  in  my  preface  to  ''  Through  Siberia,"  con- 
cerning the  prisons  and  penal  institutions  of  that 
country »  namely,  that  **  much  has  been  written  con- 
cerning them  that  is  very  unsatisfactory,  and  some 
things  that  are  absolutely  false." t  This  I  still  main- 
tain, but  by  no  means  thereby  imply  that  more  cannot 
be  correctly  said  in  their  disfavour  than  I  have  noticed. 

garls,  at  the  very  outset  of  their  careers,  find  themselves  bound  by 
oaths,  to  be  broken  at  the  risk  of  sudden  and  secret  death  should  their 
courage  fail,  or  should  they  hesitate  to  obey.  Here  lies  the  real  and 
ruthless  tyranny ;  and  the  cowardly  plotters,  safe,  skulking  in  some 
foreign  land,  are  alone  responsible.  One  reads  with  a  feeling  of  loathing 
and  disgust  an  appeal  to  humanity  from  such  cowardly  assassins.  The 
heart  throbs  with  pity  for  their  inexperienced  and  too  credulous  dupes  ; 
but  one  boils  with  contempt  and  loathing  at  the  very  thought  of  these 
vanity  mad,  cowardly  misleaders."

t  I  added,  **  One  author  published  *  My  Exile  in  Siberia*  who  never 
went  there'*;  and  to  this  Prince  Krapotkine  has  taken  strong  exception, 
saying  that  the  words  **  in  Siberia  **  were  added  by  the  publishers,  and 
not  by  Hertzen,  the  author.  I  wrote  to  the  publishers,  but  the  partner 
through  whose  hands  the  transaction  passed  is  no  longer  living,  and

I  have  never  maintained  that  Russian  prisons  are  what 
they  ought  to  be.  I  do  not  believe  they  are  what  they 
might  be,  and  I  am  sure  they  are  not  what  those 
highest  in  authority  would  like  them  to  be ;  but  all 
this  does  not  justify  the  representation  of  them  to  be 
what  they  are  not. 

Had  a  pamphlet  been  put  forth  saying  that  Russian 
prisons  are  the  best  in  the  world,  that  there  is  not  a 
speck  of  dirt  to  be  found  in  one  of  them,  that  every 
prisoner  is  as  well  employed  as  those  in  the  prisons  of 
London,  Paris,   or   Breslau,  that  the  efforts  for  their 
moral  and  spiritual  welfare  are  better  even  than  they 
were  in  Newgate — a  string  of  superlatives,  in  fact — 
I  should  have  declared  that  they  were  utterly  untrue  ; 
and  then  I  can  imagine  myself  being  regarded  as  a 
detractor,   as  some  would  now  make  me  a  defender, 
of  Russian  prisons,  whereas  I  disclaim  to  be  regarded 
as  one  or  the  other.     If  readers  have  drawn  the  con- 
clusion  from   anything   that   I   have   written   or  said, 
that  I  thought  Russian  prisons  in  general  needed  no 
improvement  and  no  reform,  then  I   have  been  alto- 
gether misunderstood,  and  I  hasten  to  say  that  there 
is  abundance  of  room  for  both.     But  having  now,  as  I 
hope,  justified  my  position  with  reference  to  what  I 
said  of  the  prisons  of  Siberia,  and  related  what  I  know 
of  the  fortress  prison  in  Petersburg,  I  shall  change  the 
venue  and  relate  what  I  saw  of  the  prisons  of  Russian 
Central  Asia. 

the  firm  cannot  find  any  record  upon  the  subject.  It  does  not  materially 
affect  the  truth,  however,  of  what  I  said,  though,  if  the  statement  about 
the  publishers  be  true,  it  is,  of  course,  a  pity  that  an  author  should  thus 
be  laid  open  to  suspicion  he  does  not  deserve,  and  I  therefore  recall 
the  sentence,  giving  him  the  benefit  of  the  doubt.

and  its  limits. 

THE  visitation  of  prisons  and  hospitals  was  a 
principal  object  that  took  me  to  Central  Asia, 
just  as  three  years  previously  it  had  led  me  to  visit 
Siberia.  Accordingly  I  thought  it  better  to  devote  a 
chapter  to  this  subject  than  to  interrupt  the  narrative 
of  the  journey  by  detailed  descriptions  en  route. 

The  first  prison  we  visited  was  in  the  suburbs  of 
Omsk,  a  building  of  dazzling  whiteness,  both  without 
and  within,  with  accommodation  for  240  prisoners  ; 
but  the  average  number  of  135  on  its  books.  There 
were  22  rooms  for  ordinary  use,  a  hospital  with  5 
rooms  more,  and  1  5  cells.  The  two  punishment  cells 
were  dark,  or  could  be  darkened  (I  forget  which),  but 
not  with  the  Egyptian  darkness  that   reigns   in   the 


662  JR  US  SI  AN'  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

punishment  cells  of  Newgate.  I  never  saw  anything 
to  equal  that  in  any  prison  of  Russia  or  Siberia.  As 
we  entered  room  after  room  I  inquired  how  many  of 
the  occupants  could  read.  Out  of  9  men  in  one  ward, 
2  could  read ;  in  another,  3  out  of  4  ;  in  a  third,  2  out 
of  4  ;  but  in  the  next  chamber  not  i  out  of  7.  These 
last  were  all  Kirghese,  of  whom  one  had  had  his  nose 
bitten  off  in  a  quarrel.  Another  room  contained  15 
women,  none  of  whom,  if  I  remember  rightly,  could 
read.  There  were  in  the  building,  at  the  time  of  our 
visit,  1 7  women  and  2  children  ;  but  the  average 
number  of  women  is  8.  The  daily  allowance  to  the 
prisoners  was  2  J  lbs.  (Russian)  of  bread,  and  ^Ib.  of 
meat.  This  latter,  I  presume,  is  withheld  on  fast 
days,  but  on  feast  days  it  is  increased  to  fib.  They 
have  soup,  and  on  Thursdays  and  Sundays  porridge, 
besides  buckwheat  or  barley  gruel. 

The  church  in  the  building  was  attended  by  the 
prisoners  on  Sundays  and  the  great  feasts,  as  was  the 
Roman  chapel  by  the  two  prisoners  of  this  creed 
then  in  prison.  In  1879  I  sent  to  General  Kaznakoff, 
then  Governor-General  of  Western  Siberia,  upwards 
of  300  New  Testaments,  Gospels,  and  Psalms,  also  a 
large  number  of  tracts  and  pamphlets  for  the  hospitals, 
prisons  and  schools  of  the  provinces  of  Akmolinsk  and 
Semipolatinsk,  and  we  found  in  this  prison  at  Omsk 
what  looked  like  a  portion  of  the  gift,  but  they  were  in 
a  cupboard  in  the  library,  precisely  where  I  had  asked 
they  might  not  be,  the  reason  alleged  being  that  when 
they  had  placed  the  books  in  the  rooms,  the  prisoners 
had  torn  them.* 

*  This  was  a  similar  difficulty  to  that  with  which  early  prison  philan- 
thropists in  England  had  at  first  to  contend,  as  witnessed  to  by  the  engrav- 
ing of  **  Mrs.  Fry  reading  to  the  prisoners  in  Newgate  in  the  year  1816/* 


THE  PRISONS  OF  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA,     663 

The  worst  feature  we  noticed  about  the  Omsk  prison 
was  one  common  to  most  of  the  Russian  houses  of 
detention,  for,  apart  from  the  necessary  work  of  the 
establishment,  they  had  not  six  men  employed.  I 
observed  that  one  room  was  somewhat  close  and 
stuffy,  but,  upon  my  calling  attention  thereto,  was  re- 
minded that  persons  of  the  class  that  prisoners  are  most 
commonly  drawn  from,  prefer  an  atmosphere  they  call 
snug  and  warm  to  fresh  air.  In  winter  especially,  they 
told  us,  **  the  prisoners  stuff"  up  all  the  holes  with  coats, 
or  rags,"  as  if  wholesome  air  were  their  greatest  enemy. 
This  fact  should  be  allowed  for  when  we  are  asked  by 
certain  writers  to  believe  in  the  horrid  condition  of  the 
atmosphere  of  Russian  prisons.* 

The   next   prison  we  entered   was   a  civil   one   at 

wherein  is  represented  on  the  wall  a  placard,  worded  thus  :  *'  Notice  is 
hereby  given,  that  should  any  of  the  Bibles,  prayer-books,  or  other  printed 
books  which  are  deposited  in  the  ward  for  the  use  of  the  prisoners,  be 
injured,  mutilated,  or  defaced,  every  prisoner  in  the  ward  where  such 
offence  may  occur  will  be  held  responsible,  and  be  subject  to  such 
punishment  as  the  keeper  may  direct.'* 

•  The  author  of  **  Called  Back,'*  on  his  way  to  Irkutsk,  talks  of  prison 
''rooms  reeking  with  filth,  the  floors  throwing  out  poisonous  emana- 
tions ' ' ;  and  when  at  last  he  finds  the  prisoner  he  is  in  search  of,  it  is 
in  a  room  thus  characterized : — **  From  the  stench  which  rushed  through 
it,  that  open  door  might  have  been  the  entrance  to  some  pestilential 
cavern  at  the  bottom  of  which  all  the  impurities  of  the  world  were 
rotting  and  putrefying^.  As  it  passed  you,  you  felt  that  the  thick  air  was 
poisonous  with  disease  and  death.**  Then,  as  if  this  aggregate  of  super- 
latives were  insufficient,  the  author  continues  :  **  Filth!  the  place  was 
one  mass  of  it.  Filth  under  foot ;  filth  on  the  walls,  the  rafters,  and  the 
beams  ;  filth  floating  about  in  the  hot,  heavy,  pestiferous  air.*'  I  beg 
the  author's  pardon,  but  this  is  great  nonsense.  I  have  been  asked  by 
friends  more  than  once,  **  Are  not  Russian  prisons  dirty  ?  *'  to  which  the 
answer  has  been  both  ''Yes'*  and  "No."  There  are  prisons  in 
England  where  the  inmate  of  a  cell  must  have  every  bit  of  brass 
polished,  and  his  habitation  spotlessly  clean  ;  or,  as  a  Russian  prisoner 
has  put  it,  "  where  the  activity  of  broom  and  pail  is  almost  demoniac.*' 
In  France,  some  of  the  cell  floors  are  polished  with  the  heel  of  a  wine 
bottle  and   "elbow  grease**;   and  I  have  seen  prison   schools  and

Semipolatinsk,  whither  we  were  accompanied  by  the 
police-master.  Here  a  felon  might  have  to  remain 
as  long  as  four  years.  There  were  78  prisoners,  of 
whom  25  were  Kirghese.  The  latter  are  sometimes 
birched  with  rods  up  to  60  stripes — an  appeal  to  their 
feelings  that  is  much  more  effectual  than  the  leisure 
of  mere  confinement,  and  the  supply  of  better  food 
than  they  habitually  get  outside.  No  less  than  20 
of  the  prisoners  were  accused  of  murder,  and  35  of 
robbery.  The  morals  of  the  inmates  at  Semipolatinsk 
seemed  to  me  better  cared  for  than  in  most  Russian 
prisons  ;  for  not  only  did  the  prisoners  attend  church 
every  Sunday,  and  often  on  feast  days,  but  a  sermon 
was  said  to  be  read  to  them  after  every  service,  and, 
what  I  have  never  before  heard  of  in  a  Russian 
prison,  a  priest  came  every  Tuesday  to  the  dining- 
room,  and  explained  the  Scriptures. 

There  was  a  religious  curiosity  in  this  prison  in  the 
person  of  a  Raskolnik  or  dissenter,  whose  equal  for 
sectarian  ignorance  and  self-righteousness  I  have  not 

asylums  so  hjrper-clean,  even  in  Russia,  that,  to  use  a  familiar  ex- 
pression, **  one  might  have  eaten  off  the  floor."  Compared  with 
buildings  such  as  these,  the  average  Russian  prison  must  be  allowed 
to  be  **  dirty,*'  or,  compared  with  a  countess's  drawing-room,  even 
**  filthy/'  But  if  such  an  expression  should  convey  to  a  reader's  mind 
what  it  did  convey  to  the  mind  of  the  friend  who  pointed  out  the  passage 
to  me,  and  who  thought  faecal  filth  was  intended  thereby,  then  such 
language  is  a  libel.  The  nearest  resemblance  I  can  think  of,  for  the 
moment,  to  the  floor  of  a  Russian  prison  is  the  floor  of  a  dirty  national 
school,  over  which  a  pack  of  boys  have  run  for  a  week  with  the  dirty  boots 
of  winter.  I  do  not  remember  ever  seeing  anything  in  Russian  prisons 
worse  than  this,  and  in  the  majority  of  cases  things  were  better ;  whilst 
as  for  the  atmosphere,  and  the  exaggerations  talked  about  it,  I  have 
been  in  Russian  prisons  at  all  hours  of  the  day,  before  some  of  the 
prisoners  were  up  in  the  morning,  and  just  before  they  were  going  to 
bed  at  night,  but  in  none  was  the  air  so  vitiated  as  that  which  some  of  the 
peasants  to  my  knowledge  chose  to  have  in  their  o^-n  houses,  or,  to 
come  nearer  home,  such  as  I  used  to  meet  with  in  parochial  \nsiting  when 
curate  of  Greenwich. 


THE  PRISONS  OF  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA,     665 

often  met.  What  had  brought  him  to  prison  I  do 
not  exactly  know ;  but  we  were  told  he  came  from  the 
Urals,  and  would  neither  serve  in  the  army  as  a 
conscript,  nor  obey  the  Government.  I  imagine 
that  he  belonged  to  the  narrowest  sect  of  the 
Starovers,  or  old  believers,  who  regard  Peter  the 
Great  as  Antichrist,  and  set  immense  store  by  old 
ikons  or  sacred  pictures,  and  ancient  service  books. 
The  only  things  this  man  possessed  were  an  old 
ikon,  and  a  Liturgy  and  daily  prayers  in  manuscript. 
Such  idols  did  he  make  of  these  that  I  believe  he 
would  have  parted  with  twenty  years  of  his  life  rather 
than  one  of  his  treasures.  I  need  hardly  say  he 
rejected  my  offer  when  I  asked  whether  he  would 
sell  them.  Of  course  I  could  not  but  in  a  fashion 
admire  his  steadfastness,  and,  thinking  to  meet  his 
prejudice  against  reading  the  Bible  in  modern  Russ, 
1  offered  him  a  New  Testament  in  Sclavonic;  but 
he  declined  it,  saying  that  he  did  not  want  it.  Thus 
he  preferred  to  be  confined  to  the  book  his  own  hands 
had  written,  to  exercising  his  mind  and  heart  in 
reading  that  which  he  had  been  taught  to  regard  as 
the  Word  of  God.  In  this  prison  I  left  matter  for  the 
prisoners  to  read,*  and  sent  to  the  Governor,  General 
Protzenko,  a  sufficiency  for  the  remaining  5  prisons, 
and  the  1 7  hospitals,  of  the  province.* 

♦  The  prisons  were  as  follows  : —

P'rom  the  official  report  of  Semipolatinsk  given  me,  I  learn  that  the 
number  of  crimes  throughout  the  province  in  1881  was  517,  or  41  more 
than  in  1880;  of  these  crimes,  362  were  of  the  nature  of  larceny,  and

Thus  far  the  prisons  I  have  mentioned  resembled 
those  I  saw  in  Siberia  in  1879;  but  on  reaching  Vierny 
we  had  before  us  something  comparatively  new.  The 
Vierny  prison,  built  in  1875,  was  surrounded  with  trees 
and  gardens,  and  enclosed  by  a  high  wall.  It  rarely 
holds  any  female  prisoners,  and  there  is  only  one  room 
intended  for  them;  but  out  of  157  prisoners  at  the 
time  of  our  visit,  6  were  women,  and  of  these  4  had 
murdered  their  husbands.  One  woman  had  promised 
£^0  to  two  Cossack  under-ofificers  to  kill  her  husband, 
but  the  captured  perpetrators  of  the  dark  deed  told  us 
they  had  not  received  the  money.  There  was  a  dark 
cell  in  the  building,  in  which  a  prisoner  might  be  con- 
fined from  4  hours  to  6  days.  The  prisoners  were 
of  varied  nationalities — Russians,  Tatars,  Kirghese. 
Dungans,  Sarts,  and  Taranchis.  Most  of  the 
Kirghese  were  in  prison  for  theft ;  a  gipsy  for  horse 
stealing ;  one  Dungan  for  attacking  a  caravan,  and 
another  had  been  a  commander  of  a  Chinese  regi- 
ment at  the  time  of  the  rebellion  in  Kuldja, 
whence  he  had  escaped  and  become  a  robber  chief, 
but  on  coming  back  to  Kuldja  was  arrested.  In  a 
room  by  himself  was  a  Russian  major  confined  for 
attempted    wife    murder,    and    in    another    room    1 1 

50  murder.  The  number  of  persons— chiefly  Kirghese — tried  was 
1,200  males  and  12  females.  The  age  of  the  majority  of  the  criminals 
was  between  21  and  30,  and  next  from  31  to  40.  Of  49  persons  con- 
demned, 2  were  females,  and  49  persons  were  retained  on  suspicion. 
From  the  year  1880  there  remained  186  prisoners — 235  were  added  in 
the  course  of  the  year,  and  258  released,  leaving  a  balance  of  163  in 
prison  throughout  the  province  on  ist  January,  1882.  The  report 
further  states  that  the  temporary  prison  at  Karkaralinsk  is  unsatis- 
factory by  reason  of  age  and  want  of  accommodation.  The  administra- 
tion of  the  prison  is  vested  with  the  Semipolatinsk  committee,  and  its 
branches  and  the  ladies*  committee  at  the  capital.  The  receipts  of  the 
committee  amounted  to  ;^i,i70,  of  which  ;^24i  were  carried  for^'ard  to 
the  next  year's  account.

prisoners  for  rape,  murder,  and  robbery.  The  chapel 
was  in  exceedingly  good  order,  and  in  the  library  I 
found,  to  my  satisfaction  and  surprise,  some  New- 
Testaments,  Gospels,  and  other  books.  The  New 
Testaments  had  been  supplied  by  a  Russian  society 
for  the  distribution  of  religious  literature,  at  the 
instance,  we  heard,  of  a  M.  Pantusoff.  who  had  given 
several  books,  and  had  others  bound  at  his  own 
expense.     We   heard  of  further  good   deeds   of  this 


Russian  gentleman,  but  were  not  so  fortunate  as  to 
meet  him.  I  am  indebted  to  him,  however,  for  some 
of  my  information  on  Kuldja,  respecting  which  pro- 
vince he  has  compiled  statistics. 

Vierny  being  the  capital  of  the  Semirechia  province, 
I  asked  the  Vice-Governor  for  statistics  of  the  prisons, 
and  a  copy  was  made  for  me  of  the  official  report 
for  the  preceding  year.  I  nowhere  else  during  my 
journey  got  anything  so  detailed,  but  as  the  prisons 


668  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

we  subsequently  entered  at  Tashkend  and  Samarkand 
were  better,  if  anything,  than  the  one  at  Vierny,  I 
assume  that  the  report  does  not  give  an  exaggerated 
idea  of  the  condition  of  prisons  in  Russian  Turkistan 
generally.  A  prominent  feature  of  the  report  is  the 
interest  taken  in  the  prisoners  by  voluntary  com- 
mittees who  manage  many  of  the  prison  affairs.* 

Instead,  for  instance,  of  the  prisoners  each  receiving 
3^.  a  day  for  food,  the  committee  undertook  to  cater 
for  them,  deputing  the  inspector  to  carry  out  their 
instructions.  Each  member  of  the  committee  came  on 
duty  by  turns  for  a  week,  visiting  the  prison  daily, 
inspecting  the  rooms  and  the  kitchen,  and  after- 
wards writing  remarks  in  the  visitors*  book.  This 
book  was,  on  a  certain  day,  submitted  to  the  Vice- 
President,  who  saw  that  the  irregularities  noted  by 
the  directors  were  rectified.  In  1881  an  abundance 
of  vegetables  was  grown  in  the  prison  garden,  such  as 
cabbages  and  potatoes,  carrots,  fennel,  parsley,  garlick, 
cucumbers,  water-melons,  and  melons,  and  in  addition 
each  prisoner  was  allowed,  daily,  ilb.  of  meat.  So 
cheap,  however,  are  provisions  at  Vierny,  that,  after 
supplying   bread    and   other   eatables,   the   committee 

•  Speaking  first  of  the  Vierny  prison,  it  says  that,  at  the  time  for 
making  annual  repairs,  the  building  was  clean  and  in  good  condition, 
but  ;^66  had  been  expended  for  repairs  during  the  year,  and  out  of 
money  saved  the  outer  walls  of  the  prison  church  had  been  plastered 
and  whitened.  A  belfry  also  was  added  to  the  church,  £2^0  only  of 
the  cost  of  ;^620  being  borne  by  the  Government,  the  committee  under- 
taking the  remainder,  and  paying  some  from  a  fund  at  their  disposal 
for  extraordinary  expenses.  Of  the  total  number  of  prisoners,  one- 
eighth  only  were  Russians,  and  of  Tatars  rather  less.  The  weather  at 
Vierny  is  hot  in  summer,  and  the  committee,  instead  of  straw  mattresses 
had  bought  140  felts,  upon  which  the  natives  are  accustomed  to  sleep, 
and  had  also  made  30  new  hammocks,  costing  ;f  18.  The  committee 
had  expended  from  its  own  special  resources,  on  wages  for  overseers, 
cook,  baker,  etc.,  £2^1. 


THE  PRISONS  OF  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA,     669 

effected  a  saving  in  the  maintenance  of  prisoners  of 
;^344,   which,  was  applied  to  other  needs.     For  the 
moral   good   of   the   prisoners,    the   report   says,    the 
committee  did  all  in  its  power,  but  nothing  is  mentioned 
beyond  the  church  services  on  Sundays  and  festivals. 
A  Cossack  prisoner  confessed  to  the  prison  inspector 
the   murder   of   his    cousin.     "All    prisoners    of    the 
orthodox  faith  prepared  for  and  were  favoured  by  the 
reception   of  the    Holy   Sacrament.''     Prisoners   who 
could  read  and  write  (of  whom,  however,  there  were 
usually  very  few)  were  supplied  with  books.     No  con- 
verts, the  report  says,  were  made  to  the  orthodox  faith. 
There    is     no    infirmary    in    the   prison,    prisoners 
seriously  ill  being  sent  to    the    military  hospital,  and 
;^  1 20  in  1 88 1  was  paid  for  their  maintenance.     Those 
with    minor    ailments    were    treated    gratis    by     M. 
Sobolevsky,  a  member  of  the  committee,  to  the  num- 
ber of  300.     (This,  I  presume,  includes  not  only  local 
offenders,  but  prisoners  en  route  to  exile.)     Only  very 
few  of  the  Vierny  prisoners  knew  any  handicraft,  and 
the  whole  amount  earned  in  the  prison  was  only  about 
£\o,  of  which  half  was  given  to  the  prisoners  at  the 
time,  and  a  trifle  remained  for  them  on  their  release. 
The  value  of  the  vegetables  grown  in  the  garden  was 
;^2  5,  the  reserves  for  winter  consisting  of  360  bushels 
of  potatoes  and    541  gallons  of  salted  cabbage.     Pri- 
soners on  their  entrance  were  inspected  by  the  physi- 
cian, sent  to  the  bath,  and  supplied  with  new  clothes. 
There   were   no  juvenile  offenders,  nor  prisoners  for 
debt  in  1881.     Among   the    gifts   sent  to  the  prison 
during  the  year,   the  report  mentions  two  bells,  and 
building  material  for  the  church  belfry  ;  a  tailor  s  sew- 
ing machine,  for  the  employment  of  the  detained,  and 
tea  and  sugar  at  Christmas  to  the  value  of  ;^5. 


670  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

After  thus  describing  what  has  been  done  at  the 
prison  in  the  capital,  the  report  deals  with  the  smaller 
houses  of  detention  in  Kopal,  Karakol,  Lepsinsk,  and 
Tokmak.  I  need  not  repeat  in  this  connection  features 
that  have  already  occurred  in  the  prison  at  Vierny,* 
but  I  have  allowed  myself  to  enter  somewhat  in  detail 
into  the  prison  affairs  of  Semirechia,  because  the  report 
gives  some  idea  of  the  prisons  even  in  the  remotest 
part  of  the  mountains,  and  also,  instead  of  vague 
commonplaces  on  Russian  prisons  in  general,  makes 
definite  statements  that  are  in  a  measure  capable  of 
disproof  if  they  are  not  true.  I  left  at  Vierny  with 
M.  Aristoff,  the  Vice-Go vernor,  a  quantity  of  litera- 
ture, in  addition  to  distributing  some  myself,  and  since 
my  return  to  England  I  have  received  an  account  of 
the  distribution,  which  is  all  that  I  could  wish.f 

*  At  Kopal  the  prisoners  were  from  4  to  8  in  a  room,  and  those 
who  could  read  were  supplied  with  religious  books.  The  report  adds, 
that  with  each  party  going  away  (that  is,  I  presume,  prisoners  on  the 
march)  the  regulations  issued  by  the  Most  Holy  Synod  (probably  con- 
cerning religious  service)  were  rigorously  complied  with.  No  donations 
were  received  at  Kopal  except  from  members  of  the  committee.  At 
Karakol,  a  small  place  far  away  in  the  Thian  Shan  mountains,  civil 
prisoners  were  kept  in  the  military'  guard-room,  the  priest  tolerably 
often  praying  with  the  prisoners  in  their  rooms  and  reading  to  them. 
At  this  place  the  prisoners'  allowance  was  given  them  in  cash,  and 
they  bought  wood  for  boiling  tea  to  the  value  oi  £2.  One  prisoner  only 
was  ill  during  the  year.  At  Lepsa,  prisoners  were  confined  in  a  private 
house  containing  5  rooms,  one  being  a  guard-room.  The  rooms  were 
fairly  large,  and  ventilated  by  louvres  in  the  windows.  Prisoners 
awaiting  trial  were  kept  separate  from  the  condemned.  Lastly,  in  the 
Tokmak  district,  prisoners  were  kept  in  a  former  telegraph  office  at 
Pishpek,  and  in  guard-rooms  at  Tokmak  and  Nar>'n.  At  Pishpek  the 
articles  of  dress  purchased  during  the  year  were  6  sheepskins  and  6 
pairs  of  felt  snow-shoes.  These  articles  were  given  to  prisoners  en 
route,  who  could  go  no  further  in  summer  clothing.  The  sum  of  12 
kopecks  per  day  for  food  allowed  of  something  being  put  by  towards 
the  purchase  of  butter  for  the  preparation  of  prisoners'  gruel.  At 
Tokmak,  besides  the  subscriptions  of  the  committee,  gifts  were  received 
from  the  surrounding  villages  to  the  amount  of  £1  8^. 

t  M.  Aristoff  writes :  **  The  books  and  pamphlets  that  you  were  so

But  to  proceed.  If  the  surroundings  of  the  Vierny 
prison  were  attractive,  those  of  Tashkend  were  still 
more  so,  for  the  building  stood  in  quite  a  park  of 
poplar  trees,  planted  in  avenues,  and  affording  shade  in 
the  intensely  hot  summer.  There  were  in  confinement 
379  prisoners,  of  whom  6  were  women,  5  natives  and 
one  Russian  (this  latter  having  poisoned  her  husband). 
The  number  of  Russian  male  prisoners  was  37,  the 
majority  of  the  remainder  being  Sarts.  On  going 
into  the  kitchen  we  found  the  soup  excellent,  and 
learned  that  on  Sundays  the  prisoners  received  an 
extra  plate  of  rice  porridge.  In  fact,  when  we  saw 
the  Sarts  and  Kirghese  sit  down  to  their  clean  wooden 
pannikins  of  soup,  after  having  seen  something  of 
native  life  outside,  it  made  no  great  claim  on  one's 
belief  when  the  chief  of  the  town,  who  accompanied 
us,  observed  that  the  Sarts  fared  far  better  in  prison 
than  in  their  own  homes.  There  was  in  the  building 
a  mosque,  with  rostrum  for  Muhammadan  preaching 
on  Friday,  when,  as  also  on  their  festivals,  as  many 
Mussulman  prisoners  as  pleased  attended.    There  was, 

kind  as  to  give  me  for  the  hospitals,  schools,  and  prisons  of  the  pro- 
vince of  Semirechia,  have  been  sent  and  distributed  in  the  following- 
manner  and  quantities :  (i)  To  the  Vierny  military  hospital,  5  Gospels, 
New  Testaments,  and  Psalms ;  (2)  Vierny  prison,  10  copies  of  the  same, 
with  3  copies  of  the  Kirghese  New  Testament ;  (3)  to  the  smaller  prisons 
at  Kopal,  Lepsa,  and  Pishpek,  have  been  sent  2  copies  of  the  Russian 
and  I  of  the  Kirghese  books ;  (4)  to  the  small  military  hospitals  at 
Kuldja  and  Kopal,  2  copies  each  of  the  Russian  books ;  (5)  a  copy 
each  of  the  Kirghese  New  Testament  to  the  Kirghese  schools  in 
Karakol  and  Vierny  ;  (6)  a  few  religious  tracts  were  given  to  the  infant 
asylum  of  Vierny,  and  all  the  remaining  books  and  tracts  were  left  at 
the  disposal  of  the  Inspector  of  the  Schools  of  Semirechia.  In  sending 
the  books  to  the  hospitals  and  prisons,  I  required  of  the  administrators, 
according  to  your  desire,  that  they  should  be  left  in  the  rooms  under 
the  responsibility  of  the  chief,  and  not  placed  in  the  libraries.  As  to 
the  Inspector,  I  asked  him  to  distribute  the  books  and  pamphlets 
amongst  the  pupils  of  the  schools  of  the  province.'' 


672  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA. 

too,  a  Russian  church,  and  a  small  library.  In  the 
lavatory,  with  cabinets,  there  was  no  offensive  smell, 
and  there  was  a  large,  flat,  basin-shaped  depression 
made  in  the  floor  for  the  Muhammadans  to  perform 
their  ceremonial  washings.  I  inquired  for  the  rods 
used  in  corporal  punishment ;  but  they  said  they  had 
none.  The  rooms  were  clean  and  airy,  and  each  was 
furnished  with  a  lamp.  I  may  add  that  the  prison 
is  built  to  accommodate  only  200  inmates,  whence 
the  obvious  inference  would  be  that  the  building 
was  much  crowded.  But  this  was  not.  the  case ; 
for  outside  the  prison  under  the  trees  were  erected 
1 1  felt  tents,  one  for  the  soldiers  on  guard,  and  the 
remainder  for  the  prisoners  crowded  out  of  the 
building,  and  who,  doubtless  from  their  manner  of 
Eastern  life,  would  be  only  too  thankful  for  the 
freedom  of  a  t^nt,  as  compared  with  what  to  their 
nomad  ideas  w^uld  be  the  stuffiness  of  a  room, 
however  airy.* 

As  we  left  the  Tashkend  prison,  there  was  a  crowd  of 
prisoners'  friends  waiting  outside  with  melons  and  other 
fruit  to  give  to  those  within.  I  thought  the  place  one 
of  the  least  repulsive  of  its  kind  I  had  seen  in  Russia  ; 
but  things  were  not  so  good  at  Khokand.  Here  the 
prison  was  near  the  Khan's  palace,  and  had  formerly 

*  I  would  call  attention  to  this  provision  made  for  surplus  prisoners, 
because  I  have  more  than  once  seen  very  strong  statements  made  as 
to  the  overcrowding  of  Russian  and  Siberian  jails,  without  any  notice 
being  taken  of  supplementary  erections  to  meet  an  occasional  emer- 
gency. Nothing  is  commoner  in  Russia  and  Siberia  than  to  see  hospital 
patients  living  under  canvas  in  summer,  and  at  Tiumen  I  remember  being 
told  that,  during  the  march  of  the  exiles,  which  takes  place  in  the 
summer  months,  they  frequently  put  up  temporary  tent  accommodation 
for  a  sudden  influx  of  prisoners.  I  do  not  mean  to  imply  for  a  moment 
that  Russian  prisons  are  not  in  many  cases  overcrowded,  for  I  know 
they  are,  but  I  wish  to  point  out  that,  in  some  instances  at  all  events,  an 
effort  is  made  to  meet  the  emergency. 


THE  PRISONS  OF  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA.     673 

served  as  a  barrack  for  the  djiguitts  of  his  Majesty, 
and  the  place  was  temporarily  crowded,  whilst 
another  chamber,  I  suppose  a  prison  proper,  wa§ 
being  made  ready.  None  of  the  prisoners  were 
Russians,  and  many  of  them  were  petty  offenders. 
One  native,  for  stealing  a  horse,  had  been  sentenced 
to  six  months  by  a  native  tribunal,  and  another  for  a 
like  term  for  the  adulteration  of  tea  with  sand,  etc. 
Of  two  women  prisoners,  one,  at  the  age  of  25,  had 
strangled  her  husband  ;  another,  at  19,  was  a  danseuse 
and  a  thief.  In  Bokhara,  they  told  me  the  Emir  did 
not  allow  girls  to  dance  in  public,  and  put  them  to 
death  for  doing  so.  I  imagine,  therefore,  that  the 
practice  of  this  art  was  accompanied  in  the  case  of 
women  by  more  than  it  implied,  as  is  sometimes  the 
case  with  the  batchas  or  dancing  boys.  Two  months 
before  our  visit  the  Khokandian  prisoners  had  tried  to 
escape  in  a  body,  and  had  been  fired  upon  by  the 
sentries,  with  the  result  that  16  were  killed,  a  nephew 
of  the  late  Khan  among  them,  and  2  mortally  wounded. 
Some  who  escaped  were  retaken  and  chained,  and 
would  be  sent,  it  was  thought,  to  Siberia,  and  a  murderer 
then  in  confinement  with  them.  This  was  the  worst 
place  of  detention  under  the  Russians  that  I  saw  in 
Turkistan,  but  it  was  a  very  palace  as  compared  with 
the  native  prisons  I  saw  and  heard  of  in  Bokhara  and 
Khiva. 

There  was  yet  one  prison  for  us  to  visit  in  Russian 
territory,  namely,  the  town  prison  at  Samarkand.  This 
is  a  brick  building  with  a  large  garden  enclosed  by 
a  high  wall.  There  were  in  it  only  8  Russian  prisoners, 
but  of  the  total  145  there  were  89  charged  with  serious 
crimes,  namely:  murder  42,  robbery  29,  theft  2,  running 
away  16.     Cases  such  as  these  are  generally  examined 

VOL.  I.  43 


674  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

and  finally  decided  by  two  local  courts,  one  being  a 
court  of  first  instance,  and  the  other  of  appeal. 
Exceptional  cases,  however,  require  the  confirmation 
of  one  of  the  Departments  of  the  Senate,  which  sits  at 
Petersburg,  such  as  :  the  condemnation  of  individuals 
belonging  to  the  privileged  classes  with  loss  of  all  civil 
rights  ;  crimes  committed  by  a  band  of  criminals,  etc., 
also  complaints  brought  against  the  incorrect  juris- 
diction of  any  of  the  local  courts.  The  Senate  is  the 
highest  court  of  justice  in  Russia,  which,  like  the  local 
courts,  is  entirely  independent  of  the  influence  of  the 
administrative  governmental  authorities. 

There  were  several  rooms  full  of  prisoners  whose 
papers  were  3,000  miles  distant;  at  Petersburg.  One 
man's  case  had  begun  10  years  before,  in  February 
1872,  and  in  April  1873,  charged  with  the  murder  of 
a  native,  he  came  to  prison.  Matters  had  been  compli- 
cated by  his  having  escaped.  His  sentence  was  15 
years*  hard  labour  in  Siberia.  One  room  was  full  of 
men  bound  for  the  same  destination.  In  another  room 
were  two  women  who  had  escaped  through  the  ceiling 
of  their  prison  at  Katte- Kurgan.  Some  few  of  the 
prisoners  had  work  to  do,  but  not  those  charged  with 
serious  crimes.  We  visited  this  prison  in  the  company 
of  General  Korolkofif,  the  acting  governor  of  the 
province,  and  doubtless  saw  things  at  their  best  ;  but 
there  was  this  advantage  in  going  on  an  inspection  day, 
that  I  repeatedly  saw  prisoners  using  their  right  on 
such  days  of  appealing  or  complaining  to  the  monthly 
visitor.  His  Excellency  told  me  afterwards  that  their 
conversation  usually  takes  the  form  of  a  question  as  to 
when  their  papers  are  coming  or  how  their  case  is  going 
on.  Sometimes  complaints  of  administration  were  made, 
but  usually  without  reason,  and  not  often  of  serious 


THE  PRISONS  OF  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA.     675 

matters.  The  prisoners  were  supplied  with  felts  to  lie 
on,  and  the  cleanliness  of  the  place  was  no  doubt  partly 
maintained  by  meals  being  taken  in  a  common  hall,  and 
no  food  eaten  in  the  rooms.  To  the  foregoing  I  may  add 
that  the  lavatory  in  this  prison  was  particularly  clean, 
nor,  from  the  adjoining  cabinets,  was  there  the  least 
unpleasantness,  thanks  to  a  stove  that  was  said  to  be 
always  kept  burning,  as  a  means  of  ventilation.* 

Here,  then,  I  conclude  my  brief  account,  such  as  it 
is,  of  the  prisons  of  Russian  Central  Asia.      Some  of 

•  I  would  call  attention  to  this  again  in  contrast  to  what  is  said  in  the 
Nineteenth  Century  for  January,  1883.  "  (The  prisoners)  lie  there  .  .  . 
in  rooms  of  inconceivable  foulness,  in  an  atmosphere  .  .  .  which  is 
charged  with  the  emanations  of  the  horrible  ^arasha — a  basket  kept  in 
the  room  to  serve  the  necessities  of  a  hundred  human  beings.'*    And 

again  (from  Madame  C 's  account) :  *'  The  water-closet  was  a  large 

pond  :  it  had  to  be  crossed  on  a  broken  ladder,  which  gave  way  under 
one  of  us  and  plunged  him  in  the  filth  below."  And  then  the  writer 
says,  **  It  must  be  owned  that  the  picture  is  horrible."  And  I  agree 
with  him.  Only,  then  he  adds,  "But  it  is  not  a  whit  overcharged,** 
and  here  I  disagree  with  him  ;  for  I  think  it  overcharged  by  a  good 
many  **  whits.**  I  thought  I  was  tolerably  familiar  with  the  furniture  of 
Russian  prisons,  but  I  have  never  once  seen  the  basket  here  referred  to. 
In  a  recently-published  life  of  Howard,  Dr.  Stoughton,  speaking  of 
Scotch  prisons  at  the  beginning  of  the  present  century,  says,  **  Mr. 
Gumey  depicts  the  prison  of  Dunbar  in  terms  similar  to  those  employed 
by  Howard  in  his  early  researches.  *  Small  rooms,'  *  extreme  filth,* 
*  a  little  straw,'  '  a  tub  for  every  dirty  purpose  ;*  *'  and  if  this  last  be  what 
the  Nineteenth  Century  writer  intends,  then  I  do  remember  meeting 
with  such  a  covered  tub  in  a  room  in  a  prison  in  the  north  of  Finland  : 
also  at  the  Alexandrevsky  prison,  near  Irkutsk,  the  Director  called  my 
attention  to  the  fact  of  his  having  contrived  so  as  to  remove  a  similar 
convenience  outside  the  doors  of  the  wards,  but  I  cannot  charge  my 
memory  with  having  seen  anything  of   the  kind  elsewhere,   whilst  I 

certainly  deny  that  Madame  C 's  description  of  another  place  is  at 

all  fairly  representative  of  what  I  have  seen  of  Russian  gaols.  It  has 
been  my  practice,  when  inspecting  prisons,  not  to  shrink  firom  going  into 
every  hole  and  comer,  and  very  disagreeable  some  of  them  have  been 
when  I  have  got  there,  and  the  sooner  they  can  be  mended  the  better. 
But  this  remark  may  go  further.  Let  it  spread  to  hotel  keepers  of  the 
Russian  interior,  including  what  was  recommended  to  me  as  the  best 
hotel  in  Baku,  where  my  senses  suffere'd  more  than  in  any  prison  I  have 


676  RUSSIAN  CENTRAL  ASIA, 

the  objections  that  were  urged  against  my  former 
testimony  will  hold  good  as  to  this,  namely,  that  I 
travelled  quickly,  and  was  therefore  liable  to  receive 
false  impressions,  and  form  erroneous  conclusions.  I 
trust,  therefore,  as  I  said  before,  that  no  one  may  be 
misled  by  taking  my  testimony  for  more  than  it  is  worth. 
I  have  tried  to  be  accurate,  and  that  is  all  I  can  say.* 
The  prisons  of  Khiva  and  Bokhara  I  shall  notice  here- 
after in  the  course  of  my  journey,  the  next  stage  of 
which  will  take  me  over  the  Bokhariot  frontier  to 
Kitab. 

entered ;  and  let  it  spread  to  the  Russian  peasants,  where  they  have 
such  plcLces  at  all  (for  I  have  met  with  instances  of  this  in  Russia,  as 
I  am  told  was  the  case  within  a  score  or  two  of  years  in  the  west  of 
Ireland,  in  Connemara,  and  even  in  the  extreme  north  of  England),  but 
let  not  the  strictures  of  the  Nineteenth  Century  be  confined  to  Russian 
prisons.  The  fact  is  that  such  places  therein  are  much  the  same  as  at 
the  houses  of  the  great  mass  of  Russian  prisoners,  sometimes  perchance 
a  little  worse,  but  sometimes  also  certainly  better. 

*  I  may  perhaps  as  well  add  that  the  foregoing  chapters  on 
prisons  have  been  kindly  looked  over,  as  on  a  previous  occasion,  by  a 
Russian  official  high  in  the  prison  administration,  who  says  that,  after 
reading  them  with  the  greatest  attention,  he  finds  no  mistakes.  With 
reference  to  the  alleged  preparation  of  the  Siberian  prisons  for  my  visit, 
he  assures  me  that  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior  made  no  such  prepara- 
tion,— in  fact,  could  not  well  have  so  done, — adding  also,  that  he 
personally  would  be  obliged  for  any  proof  that  can  be  brought  con- 
firmatory of  such  precautionary  measures  ha\ing  been  taken.

Extracts  from  Two  Hundred  Notices  of  the  Snglish,  Irish,  Scotch, 
American,  Australian,  French,  Finnish,  Qerman,  and  Swedish  Press. 


The  Times.  {One  column.) — **The  reader  will  .  .  .  find  in  Mr. 
Lansdeirs  volumes  all  that  can  interest  him  about  Siberia." 

The  AthensBum.  {Fwe  columns.) — "With  the  exception  of  Mr. 
Mackenzie  Wallace's  '  Russia,*  the  best  book  on  a  Russian  subject 
which  has  appeared  of  late  years  is  Mr.  Lansdell's  '  Through  Siberia.'  ** 

Fraeer's  Magazine.  {Thirteen  pages.) — "His  testimony  ...  is 
simply  the  best  that  exists.^'     O.  K.  .  .  .  (a  Russian  writer.) 

The  Guardian.  {Tijoo  columns.) — "It  touches  upon  political  and 
social  questions  of  great  interest,  and  offers  information  upon  the 
internal  administration  of  the  Russian  empire,  which  is  not  readily 
obtained  elsewhere.** 

Harper's  Monthly  Magazine.  {One  column,)—''  Since  the  time 
•of  Howard,  no  one  has  given  us  so  fiill  and  fair  an  account  of  Russian 
prisons  as  is  now  presented  to  us  by  Mr.  Lansdell.** 

Church  Missionary  Intelligencer.  {Four  pages.)— ''  It  is  alto- 
gether different  from  even  the  higher  class  of  books  of  travel.  It  teems 
with  information  of  every  possible  kind.** 

The  Academy.  {Four  columns.) — "  We  are  of  opinion  that 
*  Through  Siberia*  is  much  more  entertaining,  and  certainly  more 
readable,  than  many  novels.** 

The  Baptist.  {I^'o  columns.)— '*  A  man  who  undertakes  to  set 
matters  in  a  true  light  before  the  eyes  of  the  world  deserves  the  gratitude 
•of  all  parties.    This  Mr.  Lansdell  has  done.** 

The  Church  Times.  {7\vo  columns.) — "  Englishmen  have  every 
reason  to  be  proud  of  this  work ;  for  it  .  .  .  can  only  result  in  making 
the  name  of  our  country  more  honoured  and  respected  than  any  mere 
victory  of  arms  would  do.** 

The  Field. — "The  utmost  commendation  must  be  given  to  the 
reverend  author,  not  only  for  his  personal  work,  but  for  the  good  taste 
that  has  impelled  him  to  describe  his  religious  labours  in  language 
understanded  of  the  laity.** 

Revue  des  deux  Mondes.  {Twelve pages.)-— '*  Qu*on  n*aille  pas 
s'imaginer  apr^s  cela  que  M.  Lansdell  so  it  un  fanatique  ...  II  estime 
qu'une  sage  philosophie  et  une  piet6  sincere  ne  sont  irreconciliables  ni 
avec  la  belle  humeur  ni  avec  ces  honn^tes  petits  plaisirs  qui  assaison- 
nent  la  vie.*' 

Helsingfors  Dagblad  {Finland).— '''T^irough  Siberia'  has  won 
for  itself  recognition  here,  by  reason  of  its  veracity  and  conscientious- 
ness, as  well  as  for  its  shedding  light  upon  various  Siberian  matters." — 
Letter  from  St.  Petersburg. 

The  Globe.  {One  column.) — "The  work  as  a  whole  deserves  no 
slight  measure  of  praise.** 

Proceedings  of  the  Royal  Geographical  Sooielnr.—"  Contains 

much  incidental  detail  likely  to  be  of  practical  utility  to  other  travellers." 

The  Rock.  {One  column.) — "  The  volumes  are  got  up  with  great 
care,  and  remarkably  well  illustrated.  The  books  will  amply  repay 
perusal." 


NOTICES  OF  THE  PRESS.  687 

Smalandsposten  {Sweden).—*'  The  principal  merits  of  the  Author 
are  great  power  of  observation,  arid  an  objective  but  lively  style." 
.  .  .  "An  interesting  book  on  a  piquant  subject.** 

The  Saturday  Review.  {Three  columns),— **^e  take  leave  of 
our  author  in  the  hope  that,  on  the  one  hand,  neither  his  philanthropy 
nor  his  love  of  travelling  is  exhausted  ;  and  that,  on  the  other  hand,  his 
first  venture  in  the  world  of  letters  may  be  so  favourable  as  to  tempt  him 
to  a  second  .  .  .** 

The  United  Service  Gazette.  {Three  columns.)— ''There  is 
plenty  of  real  novelty  in  Siberia  without  troubling  the  novelist  any 
more.  Certainly  no  more  entertaining  book  of  the  kind,  combined  with 
usefulness,  has  been  issued  from  the  press  for  a  long  time.  .  .  .  Every- 
where there  is  something  new  to  tell  us,  and  we  wonder  why  in  the 
world  it  is  that  Siberia  has  been  left  out  in  the  cold  so  long.*' 

The  Record.  {One  column,)^ — **  The  interest  of  *  Through  Siberia* 
is  varied,  and  the  revelations  ot  the  book  will  attract  various  minds. 
The  Christian  will  find  herein  much  which  will  move  his  pity  for  souls ; 
the  ecclesiastic  will  note  with  attention  many  striking  passages  which 
will  assist  his  studies  in  comparative  religion,  and  supply  links  between 
different  ages  and  differing  Churches ;  the  philanthropist  will  engage 
himself  with  existine  human  wrongs,  and  seek  for  suggestions  as  to 
methods  for  redressmg  and  removmg  them ;  the  statesman  may  find 
light,  lurid,  indeed,  and  terrible,  cast  on  pressing  questions  of  State 
policy  and  relation  of  classes  ;  while  the  man  of  science  will  not  search 
these  pa^es  in  vain  for  facts  in  ethnology,  geo^aphy,  geology,  climato- 
logy, sociology,  and  philology,  which  will  ennch  his  stores  apd  supply 
missing  links  in  his  world  of  study.'* 

The  Pall  Mall  Gazette.  {Two  columns.^ — **  In  some  ways  Mr. 
Lansdell  has  a  better  ri^ht  to  speak  about  Siberia  than  any  previous 
western  traveller.  He  went  right  through  the  country,  from  Tiumen 
on  the  Ural  boundary,  to  Nikolaefsk  on  the  Pacific  coast.  .  .  .  His 
views  upon  the  Russian  penal  system  are  undoubtedly  founded  upon 
honest  personal  conviction.  .  .  .  Apart  even  from  its  main  subject,  it 
teems  with  useful  information  about  the  country  and  the  people,  some 
tribes  of  which  Mr.  Lansdell  has  perhaps  been  the  first  so  fully  to 
describe.** 

The  Fireside.  {Three  pages.) — **As  a  work  of  rare  interest,  we 
commend  to  our  readers  Mr.  Lansdell* s  charming  traveller's  story,  a 
book  of  which  three-fourths  of  the  first  edition  were  sold  before  it  had 
fairly  reached  the  publishers*  counter.  .  .  .  That  he  has  succeeded  in 
gathering  a  mass  of  reliable  information  is  evident;  for  a  Russian 
Inspector  of  Prisons  writes  respecting  the  proof-sheets  of  the  work : 
*  What  you  say  is  so  perfectly  correct,  that  your  book  may  be  taken  as 
a  standard  even  by  Russian  authorities.*  ** 

The  Illnstrated  London  News.-  ^*  We  can  promise  the  readers 
of  Mr.  Lansdell* s  book  a  great  deal  of  entertainment,  combined  with 
instruction,  in  the  survey  of  such  an  immense  field  of  topography, 
natural  history,  and  ethnology,  and  in  the  plentiful  anecdotes  of  wayside 
experience  and  casual  observation.  .  .  .  His  statements  are  charac- 
terised by  an  imposing  air  of  precision,  and  are  fortified  by  official 
statistics,  which  claim  due  attention  from  those  candidly  disposed  to 
investigate  the  subject.**
